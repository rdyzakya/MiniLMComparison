We're getting out
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) She's not complicated
To anyone standing alone
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
Your vows of silence fall all over
Head is loaded cards are folded
Too scared to run, I'm too scared stay
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
Let's make this last forever Let's go
Life's so strange [Outro: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
And this is what she wants
Everyone's done wrong
This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh) Left alone
The world slips by, I'm afraid that she never gave much anyway
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag So all you little ladies
These empty rooms are deafening without you This is one last time
He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
Our time's coming Aaah! It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Hope you enjoy it this time
And it's driving me crazy I can't find the best in all of this
I'm crippled from exhaustion
When your words are like
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
I saw you again
Tomorrow holds such better days
He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
Let's take some time to talk this over
Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
To tear the world in two
Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers
Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I'm right here, waiting I see, the light it feels good
When the night will begin
It's awkward trying to make my move I'll pretend that I'm fine
I've been awake for days
Best friends just won't
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I took my time, I hurried up
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home) Lay with me, I can't sleep
I'll take you over if you let me
I'm lost without you Don't leave me all alone
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful Got a lotta heart ache
Sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
I called her mom from a pay phone
Showed me the closet from the inside out
All I got is this guy Ben Dover Don't like hesh-don't like rap
And I won't be there and you're all alone
The words rot and fall away
Are back to even the score We are forgotten young suburbia
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
I'd still ask her to dance
How can you say you meant anything different
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
Left alone to wonder Mind is open, thoughts are woken
So here I am are you ready
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her But this I ask, it's what I want to know
(Fall asleep) Like violence you have me, forever, and after
I'll leave when I wanna
Those times I spent with you
Wake me when this war is over
Making fun of your friend's mom
Don't wait for me
What's my age again, what's my age again? Then later on, on the drive home
You're too late You're cold with disappointment
I've seen the way you hurry
I am such a fool When the night will begin
How would you feel, if I should choose to go
And I hold on tight
Like the ocean blue
Not that you knew me back then
Your ride best trip
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Hey, here's to you California Wearing all black out on the beach
Always And I'll miss your laugh your smile
It's so pathetic
I don't need anyone Tied up to a heart of stone
There's only one thing you should know
This night last forever
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
You said everything you'll ever say
And take, my one last breath
When I needed a friend
To face this on your own
Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon
We'll be here to do it again Wait a minute hold up a second
Don't wait for me I wish that we could save today
Good things haven't happened yet
You are the coldest stone-carved marble faces I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
Not sure if I'll get laid and
We were young and we're not growing up
Like you for I
Watch you go
But that star, it doesn't shine
These are the good old days These are the good old days
No end in sight
Salvation's barely out of reach Torn apart like the brokenhearted
The ropes to the light from the crypt to the grave
all I can take care of myself,
And maybe tonight
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Didn't mean to hurt you then
This place is so lame all these girls look the same
Dreaming down on the floor I'm a haunted house
Watch the shoreline disappear, iIt's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California
I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get
To recite this so
To break my time in two
(I miss you miss you) I took her out, it was a Friday night
(I'm never coming, I'm never coming) Come down
But words escape me
For a hobby I make bombs When the clock strikes two,
Do one thing for me tonight
You gave it all away
To the ocean blue Going back to San Diego
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
I wish I could explain myself
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag Fuck this place, I lost the war
Be sure to choose the right guys
I'm not in the seat
Tidal waves they rip right through me
The police came and took me away
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
And remember her smile
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
And your gone
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
This awkward silence makes me crazy
Pick me up now, I need you so bad.
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
You'll turn to a friend
Source of most frustration
I need some more time to fix this So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
Are you afraid of being alone
Turn the music up way too loud
This time where are you Houston
Goodnight There she was like a starry night
I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching vacation
When I know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
I talk to you every now and then
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep
I acted like an ass, I'd
I'm seasick from the years we've passed
But not stupid
'Cause we got no control
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again I'll turn to a friend
The whispers turn into a scream
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot We are the broken
Can I get an Amen? Now from the floor, can I get a Hallelujah? Now from
These nights go on and on and on I can't keep your voice out of my head
Life's waiting to begin I cannot live
Can't go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can't go back to San Diego) I got no regret right now
Stop this pain tonight
(I miss you I miss you) Where are you and I'm so sorry
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe We really need to see this through
"I'll write you once a week," she said Why does it feel the same
And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) Yeah my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
Kiss you taste you all night
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
And the conversation dies
And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
It's so cold out tonight, I'll
You know it meant everything (everything)
'Cause you're the only thing I feel Six bottles went down the drain
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Been running strong for seven years
They question who we used to be
Lost and cold and fading fast
Got a lotta heart ache
Underneath fluorescent lights
Can't give in what went wrong
Decisions make my mind ache
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
It gets me so It's understood, I said it many ways
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot It's alright to tell me what you think about me
We left a scar
Soon we'll all be gone
I didn't mean to call you that Come here, please hold my hand LORD now
Oh, oh, oh, oh Where the hell did you come from, outer space or heaven above
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
I'll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
Remember the time we shared
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
You're to blame Let this train wreck burn more slowly
(I'm feeling this)
These are the good old days Last night it came as a picture
(Ah) One thing / I don't know why
More than just sticks and stones
The tour was over, we'd survived
It's obvious I saw you again and again and again
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And she said, (na na na na na) Can you read my thoughts, I'm not sure what I said
We'll be there to try it again Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Faces I've seen in magazines
I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
We'll use this song
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And if we can have another day
To remind myself how
Oh, oh
Watch the time go right out the window
You'll close it off, board it up
Can't count all the things they see
As I struggle through each and every year
And I'm quite aware we're dying Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
I know that you're leaving you must have your reasons
This night's almost over
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
Oxblood traces of the night before We are forgotten young suburbia
I wrapped my car around a tree
The difference between east and west
I know now that nothing is free
And I'm too fucked up
I feel the darkness break upon her
One more time with feeling She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
You should just turn and run because you'll find out that
And I know that you dated other guys
I tried so hard
We're not growing up You're giving up
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I'm empty like the day after Christmas
I wanna take off her clothes
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive
(The last train home) [Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Where do we go (life's temporary)
And hear your voice of treason
Life's waiting to begin Any type of love it will be shown
Something inside is incomplete
I can do bad and you can do better
But I know we can't stay the same
I've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself.
All along And I'm hoping
And now I give up,
Believe me I failed this effort
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
And I keep pushing you away
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
I hope I won't forget you Should I go back should I go back should I
(Oh oh oh oh) I said I'm sorry I'm a little bit of a letdown
You're to blame He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
So here I am are you ready Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Is somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive Los Angeles, when will you save me
Worst painkiller, that all-in filler
Everything you wished came true
So here I am I'm trying
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
This place is void of all passion
At times like these
(I'm feeling this) Show me the way to bed
Solitudes a reason to die Just you wait and see
I can't wait till I get home
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I'm barely here
This heavy burden There's a halo in the distance
Since I have used that line You couldn't wait for something new
'Cause you're the one I miss
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Left you in the bar to try and save face You can only lean on me for so long
You're out of line and rarely sober
Again
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
We go where we know With all of this I feel now
Avoided hazards
Short of breath my long-lost love
But I was so stupid then
This place is fucking cursed in its plague
And I'm quite aware we're dying
Eyes are red and my movements slow
Give all my things to all my friends
I feel your hand unlock the door
I don't need anyone Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
All I know
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over Save your breath, I'm nearly
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
Stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me you're already
Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
My dearest friends
My little windmill Please take me by the hand
The clock's running
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
And I saw you again and again and again
If you can imagine it's easy if you try
I guess its just another night alone Now as I walk down the street
