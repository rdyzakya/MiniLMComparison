Let me honey and I'll catch your tears
Each one waiting for the other
May I feel your arms around me
And I feel like I'm comin' home These are better days baby
I said yeah, yeah, alright I'm driving in my car
But with you forever I'll stay
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
But tomorrow's fall in number
Or just a brilliant disguise Tonight our bed is cold
I know it was her pink Cadillac
An unfulfilled life, makes a man hard Oh, darlin'
And who(se) shall be pushed aside
Waste your summer praying in vain
Out of these hard luck bones These are better days baby
I was blinded Hey little girl is your daddy home
Now those memories come back to haunt me
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Hello beautiful thing
Holdin' hands two by two A breeze crosses the porch
When I'm walking down the street with you Sha la la la la la la
He got out down on Main Street and went into a local bar
Well let it all tumble right into the sea
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
That secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness
Rode my kids on the fire engine through the streets of freehold
Stand up right now and let them shoot through you Well now, Wild Billy was a crazy cat
Or that train to come roarin' round the bend
Or if any of this matters anymore after all But the stars are burnin' bright like some mistery uncovered
With a fear so real
We swore blood brothers against the wind
Honey we can park it out in the back
Because I love you so I was tryin' to find my way home
But at night I feel the darkness near
For hearts of stone
'Cause when we kiss
On a Saturday night
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A. Come back home to the refinery
But to us it never would
'Til you get your facts learned
Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Bring on your wrecking ball
Oh I don't know, I don't know
A cage that's been handed down the line
Oh, oh I wanna be with you
Stand right up and let her shoot through me Now, the night was bright and the stars threw light
And picked a rendezvous for the night
Yeah, I got a first class ticket but I'm as blue as a boy can be Then I'm walking in Memphis
And it seems like you've been meaning to do me harm
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
A longing to be free
Ah tell me if you will, cynthia
And my dreams are full tonight I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Oh, she's the one In my dreams our love was lost.
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine
Pink Cadillac Now some folks say it's too big
This is your hometown In '65 tension was running high at my high school
Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
That's as good as you, cynthia
Desperate as the night moves on
You better get it straight girl
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire Woo ooo ooo
Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
This skin, your fingers on my skin
I want to find out what I got But I believe in the love
I don't sleep at night
...pay me my money down....
Gone tumblin' down into the sea Listen to me
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted The dogs on Main Street howl
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
For the foolish things I do
That I don't understand
Ooo ooo ooo
Blue blue ribbon in your hair
From what they gave
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Smashin' in my guts man
But I come when you whisper
I wake, but I don't move With her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill
These mills they built the tanks and bombs
If you want me come sunny skies or rain
Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
It takes a red headed woman
When whatever here is done
You wake up in the night
Or the chains your lover wears
Yeah just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
Well one more step and it'll be too late
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.
No retreat, baby, no surrender Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim
I know you ain't ever gonna be my dream come true
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school
That I earned in freehold Well, I got outta here really hard and fast in freehold
From which no man can keep Candy safe We kiss, my heart's pumpin' to my brain
Two hearts are better than one Woah [Verse 1]
I just want something to hold on to
We pulled it a little tighter around our necks
Baby we were born to run Men walking 'long the railroad tracks
You say you're happy and you're doin' fine
Riding in the back
In an everlasting kiss One, two, three, four! The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Glory days, glory days I think I'm going down to the well tonight
A million miles away You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face
Is that me baby
Glory days, glory days Well they'll pass you by
There was nothing you could do
So tell me what I see
Yes I do
Here darlin' in Youngstown From the Monongaleh valley
Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light
Woo ooo
Or just how cool you walk
Ho, ho, ho, say, hey, hey, what you say Sherry Darlin', oh come on
I asked her what she put in it
And don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
All night (all night), all night (all night), all night (all night), all night (all night)
These are better days
That's what I wanna do Well I lost my job at the texaco station
I got a brother named Franky, and Franky ain't no good Now ever since we was young kids, it's been the same come down
Couldn't pass the test
Sha la la la la la la la
If you've ever seen a one-legged dog then you've seen me Then you've seen me, I come and stand at every door
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
Let the brokenhearted love again
She'll look at you and smile
Don't tell me a lie
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li I see you Mary in the garden
Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
A dream of life comes to me
Now the yards just scrap and rubble
Lay down your money and you play your part
Another fight and I slam the door on
Bathing in the city's aqueduct Go! Well the highway is alive tonight
Hey hey little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
And all you operators back in the park
Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind
Well it comes at a hard hard price
Tenth Avenue freeze
Spirit in the night (all night), all night (all night)
'Long came Wild Billy with his friend G-Man
There's a little cafe, where they play guitars all night and all day
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Cover me, come on in and cover me
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Woo ooo ooo
But do I really feel the way I feel? Saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
And I ain't got nothing to say
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Janey don't you lose heart Well every river, baby, it runs dry
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Outside's the rain, the driving snow
You can't start a fire without a spark
They caught you in their sights
I wear my love darlin', without shame
She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again
Here darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy worked the furnaces
You've been twisted up 'til you've become just another part of it
Come tomorrow
You pick up little dynamite, I'll pick up little gun
You were drifting down and you couldn't get back
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room, I'm comin' to lend a hand
Yeah that's all right, that's fine with me
For a savior to rise from these streets
Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you,
Just a little of that human touch Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize
I was trying to make it home through the forest
This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
Oh yeah, little girl, I want to marry you
Blood brothers in the stormy night
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Hell, in the end it all just goes and comes around
She's got a secret garden
Two hearts are better than one Sometimes it might seem like it was planned
We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam
Janey don't you lose heart
So put your ear close to the phone
When you need me just call my name If you miss me, I'll be there
I bought a record with all the latest grooves
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
They built a blast furnace
Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain
'Cause without you my life just wouldn't be the same
Lifts away the blues when I rise
Soul engines running through a night so tender
Well baby you know you bug me
Like this whole town drops
Here in Youngstown
Till a sign said "Canadian border five miles from here"
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Pay me my money down (trumpet)
Ooh that just won't keep In the silence I hear my heart beatin'
In freehold Well, my folks always lived and worked right here in freehold
Pay me my money down ...pay me my money down....
Hold still for god's sake
I'll play the faithful man
Is that you baby
Then you've seen me, bet I can make you smile when the blood, it hits the floor
Prove it all night girl and call the bluff
But I know pretty soon you'll be walkin' this way
And me well honey I'm pretending
I can usually find me a free beer somewhere
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed Her and her husband Bobby, well they split up
With a vow to defend
Girl I'll prove it all night for your love Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow
'cause you're so out of sight
We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away
This strange thing you give
I come home from 'Nam worked my way to scarfer
You can bet
Say hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin'
Bring on your wrecking ball Now my home was here in the Meadowlands, where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes
The captain knocked me down with a spar,
If I could wrench one moment into my hands
Tryin' to make a connection with you This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
Hey!
So you know she's really there
All night, a little bit more
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone Beneath the city, two hearts beat
There ain't no way I can satisfy you
She felt so nice
Wait for me Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
He went to his grave a broken heart
And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run
He could throw that speed ball by you
Well how could something so bad, darling
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
She said "I'm sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore" My father's house shines hard and bright
Blinded by the light
I saw you last night
There's a new day comin'
All I know since I found you
Yeah! The highway is alive tonight
That's what I'll do
Yeah, yeah, alright
Down to the river
I just want to hear some rhythm I want a thousand guitars
Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house
But between our dreams and actions
When we kiss
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
So somebody ran out
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here Come on up for the rising
But, hell, a little touch up
So hold tight on your anger
Don't you shut out the light Well on his porch they stretched a banner that said "Johnny Welcome Home"
But there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies
I'm happy with you in my arms
Now darling I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
From the churches to the jails
Girl in white outside a church in June
Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too
So if you're rough enough for love
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks Oh oh, come take my hand
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
I never liked to eat
A red headed woman
And I stood beside the sink
Hustling for the record machine
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
As we take our stand
And I'll take her on all the rides 'Cause down the shore everything's all right
To be safe and warm
Take your best shot, let me see what you've got
She'll let you into the parts of herself
We both survived freehold Well, my buddy mike, well, he's the mayor now in freehold
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
And these badlands start treating us good Woah oh woah oh woah oh For the ones who had a notion
But maybe, darlin', I could help them along Little girl, I want to marry you
Their voices sing out
I guess it's two years gone by now
Blow away the dreams that break your heart
But I was living in a world of childish dreams
He bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Tenth Avenue freeze-out And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
Act real cool, stay out all night, it's gonna feel alright
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down
He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am
It was just as black and whispering as the rain,
Freehold
All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun
Now we're wondering what they were dyin' for Here in Youngstown
Across the river to the Jersey side
And a king ain't satisfied
A million miles away My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state
Blood brothers in a stormy night
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
At night I could hear the blood in my veins,
Where we really wanna go
Ain't gonna move 'til you're good and ready
This place that is my home I cannot stay
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
They're build like light
The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright and lined with the light of the living
And these badlands start treating us good Woah oh woah oh woah oh
We choked out all the life that out love could hold
Or is it something worse
Always quiet, holding hands
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
Dancin' in a sky filled with light
I hope that you're coming to stay I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
Man I ain't getting nowhere
'till their strength gives out
We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay
If as we're walking a hand should slip free
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us
Yeah that's all right, I don't mind at all
Mmmm, you make me holier
And I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me
Yeah, are you listening to me baby? Talk about a dream
Sad eyes never lie
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
Actin' like a fool
For a moment that just don't come
Than we ever learned in school
Well this morning I ain't fighting tell her I give up
I was wearin' the cross of my calling
When she was just seventeen
Someday these childish dreams must end
Of your pink Cadillac
I know a pretty little place in Southern California, down San Diego way
Don't worry we're gonna find a way I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
They'd haul my money in in crates,
'Cause tonight I want to be with you Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
I saw something tucked in shame
But do I really feel the way I feel? Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane
Tell me can you ask for anything more? These things that have comforted me, I drive away
And have a party in your pink Cadillac
You complain my car makes too much noise
When you're in love with a Jersey girl Sha la la la la la la
Is there anybody alive out there? I just want to hear some rhythm
I'm trapped In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
Samson and Delilah
But I got debts that no honest man could pay
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
I want to guard your dreams and visions
I can't talk now, I'm not alone
And I think I'd like a drink" Mama said, "I've just the thing
Here comes the pitch, a swing and a miss Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Yeah no matter what I do, well you know it's true
Here along the shore
Ooh my darlin'
Oh, your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
But till then tramps like us
With these drums and these guitars 'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
And salamander thighs
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
That night in freehold Well, the girls at freehold regional they looked pretty fine
Peaceful skies in my lover's bed
Baby I'm tougher than the rest I don't need your answered prayers
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom?s
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have any money
But don't worry baby
well...
But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed
I got thrown out of my house
But I didn't count on this package deal
She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
I got the radio on and I'm just killing time
Were back in the alley tradin' hands
Give me a little of that human touch Tonight down on union street
To brush the sunlight from your hair
Workin' 'neath the wheels
Tenth Avenue freeze-out Well, I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving
We saw it happen to all the others
Well alright, alright, alright, let's go When you need me call my name
Let the broken hearts stand
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me
Down here it's just winners and losers
So tell me who I see
Guardian angels, they watch from above
Baby we were born to run Come on with me, tramps like us
Love's a fool's dance
But all I heard was a drone
Your hometown
Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
For hearts of stone I went out walking the other day
Share a little of that human touch
But oh no It was like we held a noose
And you cry because nothing good ever lasts
Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end Our love has fallen around us
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture
The walls of my room are closing in
I went out for a ride and I never went back
When I come knocking, she smiles pretty, she knows I want to be Candy's boy There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face
I met you with indifference, and I don't know why. Now I wake from my dream, I wake from my dream to this world.
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City Well brunettes are fine man
Down in the Jungle Room Then I was walking in Memphis
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
I need a love reaction
Pharaoh's army got drownded
I ain't afraid to make (I ain't afraid to make) My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and
There's a war outside still raging
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
I wish I was Mr Gates,
Promise of a better world to come
With the ghost of old Tom Joad It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the sky
Just to slip this skin Night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake,
Trapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I've been sleeping in your bed too long
Together we moved like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night) Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Back in your arms Every day here you come walking
To the hours and minutes tickin' away
You say you wanna be alone
But you were missing
Or a drug to take away the pain that living brings
Working all day in my daddy's garage
Well honey it ain't your money
Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood
Flicker above Bob's Grill
Before it gets too late [Chorus]
To the records that the DJ plays
O Mary don't weep Well one of theses nights bout 12 o'clock
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Pay me my money down Well 40 nights, nights at sea
W.C. Handy, won't you look down over me?
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
To go drivin' round
Dancin' down a dark hole
Called my relatives some dirty names
And says "penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill" She went away
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
So if you need me I'll be there I got no time for the corner boys
Spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
You can't shut off the risk and the pain
Rosalita, you're my stone desire Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knee Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there
Like a dead man talkin' 'Neath a summer sky my eyes went black
Down here on Magic Street
Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back
Tell me, friend, can you ask for anything more?
Gonna chase the clouds away
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well if something in the air feels a little unkind
Together we could break this trap
I want to sleep beneath
If we go out, you say I'm such a bore
Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down And the girls in their summer clothes
Is there anybody alive out there? I was driving through the misty rain
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Well, I know babe
That's what I wanna do
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
Though the world turns you hard and cold
Pass me by La la la la, la la la la la la la
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A. Lights out tonight
And in the lonely cool before dawn
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Honey, you had a rough road to go, but you ain't made of nothin' but soul
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
I don't give a damn
If you think it's your time, then step to the line, and bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball
Tell me I am the man for whom you put it there You never smile girl, you never speak
I was born and christened
Bells ringing filled the air
Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
This is your hometown Tear drops on the city, Bad Scooter searching for his groove
I believe in the faith
I want to read your mind
And we'll walk in the sun
To get a dirty job done Born down in a dead man's town
We stood at the alter
Yeah, none baby but the brave
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
When he come home from world war two
You just turned, and then you looked away
Girl all I want to say I keep searchin' for you darlin'
When we had no place to go
Happy with you in my heart
Well it's a yeah, yeah, alright
On my shoulder a half mile of line Come on up for the rising
But I'll teach my eyes to see, beyond these walls in front of me
And looked into the eyes
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Pass me by And the girls in their summer clothes
Honey I want the heart, I want the soul
Boppin' through the wild blue
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
Oh pay me, oh pay me,
This is your hometown
And baby I can't stand it
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
I love you more than you'll ever know
I wonder if they miss me, they still get the itch
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
No flowers no wedding dress That night we went down to the river
I'm a dead man walkin'
But to get to Candy's room you gotta walk the darkness of Candy's hall
And it seems like I'll be wearing the same old chains
Here darlin' in Youngstown When I die I don't want no part of heaven
And trouble never far behind
It's like eatin' caviar and dirt
I'm a dead man walkin' In St. James Parish
Sad eyes never lie Well for a while I've been watching you steady
Something from the love they gave
Babe I want to know if love is real Oh, can you show me Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Temptations always come along
She starts laughing thinking about Glory days well they'll pass you by
We were standin' at the bar
Well, baby, it ain't so bad
'Cause I'm running on the bad side and I got my back to the wall
In Youngstown
We haul'd some barges in our day
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
Bicycle spokes spin 'round
Now baby won't you come with me 'Cause down the shore everything's all right
'Cause in the darkness, there'll be hidden worlds that shine
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
Chase my daddy down in these bars
You wake up and you're dying
To your hometown
When all the answers, they don't amount to much
Mmh, fire
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt
Except for a moment in some stranger's eyes
Badlands
Fix your hair up nice, fix yourself up pretty
Something that would last, honey, I would
Sha la la la la la la la la
I get the message she's sendin'
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Do you think what I'm askin's too much
I got something runnin' around my head
In the middle of the pouring rain Touched down in the land of the Delta blues
But I'll wait for you
Now I've got my story
Right between the pretty lies that they tell
I just want to feel you in my arms
And I believe in a promised land I was born right here on randolph street in freehold
Cover me, wrap you arms around and cover me
On Billy and Davy dancin' in the moonlight
Take my baby to the carnival
And it's mama's soup surprise" Your Mamma's yappin' in the back seat
We'll stand together and we'll take 'em on
Cynthia, maybe it's just me babe
Like you're so sure I'll be standing here I've got a mule and her name is Sal
And girl I'll prove it all night for you I'll prove it all night
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Love can conquer hate
I've seen enough I don't wanna see any more,
Everybody's out on the run tonight
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing
Then little by little
Did he go away and leave you all alone, mmm mmm
A book of love with all the latest moves
And they dance like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
And I believe in a promised land Well there's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor
Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright
I was blinded
Pass me by Kid's rubber ball smacks
La la la la, la la la la la la la I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
You explain I'm really not your type
Yeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again But now, I'm trapped, oh yeah
And I believe in a promised land I've done my best to live the right way
Every place we went I held your hand
What are those words whispered baby
So if you need me just call my name When you need me call my name
In a world like this
I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart
From out on the road I could see its windows shining in light I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
Or just a brilliant disguise I heard somebody call your name
Trapped, oh yeah
I'll prove it all night Spread out now Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
Or the secrets that you hold
Sure as the turnin' of the night into day
Pink Cadillac Well now way back in the Bible
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
Girl there's nothing else that we can do
Well you make us happy, honey, when we feel sad
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.
Or the girls out on the avenue
Then I watched him walk right through
Boring stories of glory days Glory days well they'll pass you by
Rosalita, you're my stone desire, alright Now, I know your mama, she don't like me, 'cause I play in a rock and roll band
Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'
And I ask myself
It's just a dead man talkin' Once I had a job I had a girl
Crushed velvet seats
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see
Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Poor man want to be rich
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
Tonight all I can say is "holy shit, I'm back!"
Wait for me We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side
I been watching you awhile
Go ahead and let 'em all talk
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The music was never-ending
He was staring at the ceiling
Big bank clock chimes
They come to join us here
In a bedroom locked in whispers
We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take
We fell in love I knew it had to end
'Cause when this world kicked me around
As people always will
Waitin' on a sunny day Hard times baby, well they come to tell us all
To the way you used to be
Let your love lift me up I hold you in my arms
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
And the judge put it all to rest
We will find our love, we will find our love Your skin, your hand upon my neck
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart
O Mary don't weep O Mary don't you weep, don't mourn
But when the game is over I won't walk out the loser
I give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm takin' you home
There's better days shining through
In the cool of the evening light
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
Sister I won't ask for forgiveness
So close your eyes and I'll be there
Lost track of how far I've gone
And babe I tried to make the latest scene
If you need me I'll be there
Have you ever seen a one-legged dog making his way down the street?
Something that ain't there no more
Try to make it real
I got one thing on my mind
'cause this is the last dance, the last chance
Bouncing off a satellite
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Well I got some beer and the highway's free
Waitin' on a sunny day Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
But baby that's alright
Unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as a howlin' wind.
You hear their voices telling you not to go
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
I lie here wide awake
Trapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I've been playing your game way too long
There behind the morning clouds
Captain worked every last dollar out of me,
O Mary don't you weep, don't mourn
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned Well you don't like, don't like the way I walk
It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you've got
And all our little victories and glories, have turned into parking lots
My sins are all I have Now the clouds above my prison
Ain't good enough for you I tried to change, I got a job in sales
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus Now baby everything dies baby that's a fact
Well maybe we'll cut someplace of our own
Feel a little of that human touch
And it's mama's soup surprise" I went into the bathroom
I'll get it in a wink
I'm talking bout a Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth
Here you come all dressed up for a date
In the end what you don't surrender
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City Now our luck may have died and out love may be cold
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
That's what makes us great I come from down in the valley
Felt so right
And if you're rough and ready for love
Now baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end We didn't count tomorrows
That sends me down to the river
Is there anybody alive out there? I just want to feel some rhythm
Well alright come on now
Feeling out of sight
This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there? I was spinnin' 'round a dead dial
In that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door
Pay me my money down Oh pay me, oh pay me,
Hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin' Well let there be sunlight, let there be rain
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
Mary acts like she don't care But I remember us riding in my brother's car
From passing cars
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help You can't start a fire
Nothing matters in this whole wide world
And can't stand the company
He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
Musta been you sighin' so deep
You didn't have to live that life
And Rosie, you're the one Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his taillights disappear Me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood
O Mary don't weep, don't mourn
And your game has been decided, and you're burning the clock down
And disappear down Flamingo Lane Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo
Well there's another dance
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and come out with my soul untouched
I take her hand and we move away And tonight, now I'll see old friends
Lift me up and I'll fall with you lift me up
Caught in things they got no chance to win
'cause all I wanna do is be seen with you They gave me my pay and said walk
Baby just one kiss will get these things for you
These are better days it true
You were here just a moment ago There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall
Oh down to the river we ride The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
You're walkin' in the sights, girl of point blank
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
Come on up for the rising
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
Touched down in the land of the Delta blues
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
No one baby but the brave Oh strong enough to save
Back in your arms, back in your arms again. You came to me with love and kindness, but all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness.
Off go the sleepy front porch lights Downtown the store's alive
But you can't hide your desire
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
Oh down to the river we did ride I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
Look for me, Mom, I'll be there Wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand
They haunt me like a curse
This heart, this heart this wilderness
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
O Mary don't weep
Yeah, well baby, is it your style
Going someplace, there's no going back
Yeah I know that I'll walk out of here again
Find somebody itching for something to start The dogs on Main Street howl
Pay me my money down,
Good will conquer evil and the truth will set me free
To trade in these wings on some wheels
We'd be the lucky one to get out You said, none baby but the brave
Their love they didn't deny
And the light above
She has men who give her anything she wants, but they don't see
I want more than just a dream to tell Born in this world, darling, with few days
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
that you gave me
I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight
She cut me like a knife
Back in your arms, back in your arms again Oh once I was your treasure, and I saw your face in every star.
You hear their engines rolling on
For hearts of stone And you cry because things get so strange so fast
And uses too much gas
Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay Here in Youngstown
I come home in the morning
'Til you get your back burned
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
There's still cynthia, oh yeah Cynthia, no one knows your number
First fell in love with this guitar
Tonight in Jungleland I've been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean
Together they take a stab at romance
With a wide open country in my eyes
There'll be tenderness in the air
Happy in each other's arms
They can see every cheap thing that you ever done Well I don't care how many girls you've dated, man
Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
And I asked her to danceas the drummer counts his play
Through the middle of my soul At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And you complain about the clothes I wear
Even if we're just dancing in the dark You sit around getting older
And hearts of fire grow cold
May their precious blood bind me
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And a little of that human touch
And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone
They scream your name at night in the street
We'd go down to the river
We're all riders on this train So you've been broken and you've been hurt
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
that can save me
Cruising down the street
And it's one false move and baby the lights go out Once I dreamed we were together again
Baby, of none, baby, but the brave No one baby but the brave
[Verse 1]
I'd like to see a mule as good as my Sal
But do I really feel the way I feel? They've got catfish on the table, they've got gospel in the air
And I said "Ma'am, I am tonight" Walking in Memphis
Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Girl, did you forget how to fight
There's holy pictures of our children
I just want someone to talk to
Now Sherry my love for you is real
Will always stay
You'll always know your neighbour
Everything was in place, everything was all right
A grip so tight
The way you were back then
I got a picture of him in her arms now Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Bobby pulled his Ford out of the garage and they polished up the chrome
You were lost and in trouble so far from home
I hold my tongue, I don't do much talking
I ain't nothing but tired
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life Come on up for the rising
And kicked him back to Bufallo Low bridge, ev'rybody down
That hardly protect you from too many dreams passed by I see you standin, across the room watchin' me without a sound
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Over on the edge of town
I said, I'm hurt, she said, honey, let me heal it
Sure as the tickin' of the clock on the wall
And it seems the game I've played has made you strong Because, I'm trapped, oh yeah
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
So honey last night I met this guy
No retreat, baby, no surrender Ohh ohh ohh
One step up and two steps back Bird on a wire outside my motel room
When you said "i love you so"
That's where I find you tonight
And follow your dreams down Well, we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four
Aw, let's turn this thing around
I believe in the hope And I pray
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Or will we leave each other alone like this
But you ain't lived 'til you've had your tires rotated By a red headed woman
Mister I ain't a boy, no I'm a man
And my heart broke at least half a dozen times
Mister no need for you to listen
Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight
Badlands Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
Because tonight all the dead are here, so bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
Father, it was just something I did for a smile
Oh oh Well It's Saturday night
And that it goes too fast
Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end On a loose end There's a pale horse comin'
I was unrecognizable to myself
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Let your love lift me up When the morning bright
Ain't good enough for you, hey!
If you've ever seen that scarecrow then you've seen me
You lie in bed and feel this emptiness
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
But the church bells they ain't ringing
It's full of lots of protein
Well I'm tired of comin' out on this losin' end
Come on up for the rising tonight Left the house this morning
Senorita, come sit by my fire
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
I don't need that sky of blue, babe
Franky came home in '68 and me I took this job Yeah we're laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back
Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency
Happy, darling, come the dark
Or taste your kiss
None baby but the brave
'cause I don't need to hold you
No, no It was like we held a noose
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing
A kiss to seal our fate tonight A kiss to prove it all night
Prayin' that tomorrow, everything will be alright
Driving 'cross the Waynesboro county line
We got one last chance to make it real
But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms I awoke and I imagined, the hard things that pulled us apart
...pay me my money down.... At night I go to bed
Livin' one false move just one false move away
Come on up for the rising tonight Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li There's spirits above and behind me
Well, you give us a reason to start whisper "why"
That sends me down to the river tonight
And I know someday I will find the key
But we ain't learnin'
Well, if you were different, black or brown
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down At night I walk the streets lookin' for romance
Ain't good enough for you
Maybe you been watching me too
So hold tight, baby, 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'
I know a place where the dancing?s free
Tell me what you've got baby, waiting under there
And tasty toenail pies
I get up every morning and go to work each day
I'm gonna tear your holy walls down
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
Pushing that baby carriage at your feet
And a little of that human touch Baby, in a world without pity
Ain't gonna find no miracles here
Till every feel you've felt burst free
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
But there's no place left to hide
One step up and two steps back It's the same thing night on night
We went down to the courthouse
I love you for your pink Cadillac
The door's open but the ride ain't free
A sadness all her own
No matter what I do, girl you know it's true
On the streets of Philadelphia Ain't no angel gonna greet me
Oh now baby, this ain't no come-on
Talking about getting out
Walking in Memphis
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
We know every inch of the way
And you cry because things ain't like before
My darlin'
I know that some day she'll wear my ring So don't bother me man I ain't got no time
And you cry I'm always out with the boys Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Where mister when you're young
Whoaaa! We played king of the mountain out on the end
I lived by luck and faith.
Hard times come, hard times go
Well, I left and swore I'd never walk these streets again, jack
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
End of the night I lean in for a kiss
And on all the pretty things that you can't ever have
Janey don't you lose heart Crazy Janey and her mission man
Well, I went to school right here
Little girl, I want to marry you Oh, my daddy said right before he died
With offers of free meals I am blessed
Now security they did not see him They just hovered 'round his tomb
And vitamins, I think" "Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips
God have mercy on the man
She'll let you in her mouth
Ooh...growin' up Can't see nothin' in front of me
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band And she was blinded by the light
But man I ain't going for that
I believe in the end Two hearts are better than one
That helped the union win the war Here in Youngstown
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back There's a girl across the bar
Somebody that you could just to talk to
Janey don't know what she do to you
James and Danny Heaton
It was a bit of a redneck town
Hitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine
These are better days baby
This gun's for hire
To see sump'n'so good, in a world gone bad
Struggling to do everything right
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I got dressed and to that house I did ride
'Cause they understand
Back in freehold Well, this summer everything was green in freehold
And baby this car just ain't big enough for her and me So you can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top
Well that's okay, baby, I don't mind
We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock
Well the world just strips away Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers
I pick up my money and head back into town
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
But I know they're gonna turn my way And the girls in their summer clothes
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
I want to find one face that ain't looking through me
I can take you higher
With a chance to make it good somehow
Once I made you rich enough
I want to go out tonight
So they put a rifle in my hand
We're gonna get to that place
And I got you, and baby you've got me
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
I couldn't tear it apart
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal Low bridge, ev'rybody down
And so every day, every night
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Missing... I searched for something to explain
I heard the voices of friends, vanished and gone,
Hold tight to your anger, and don't fall to your fear Now when all this steel and these stories, they drift away to rust
Words were passed in a shotgun blast
Make you look like a fool boy Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
And man that was all she wrote
Did he ever walk down this streets at night
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
Here where the blood is spilled, the arena's filled, and Giants play the game
Hold tight on your anger
And I awake and I find you near
Ooh, fire But late at night
Some folks say it's too old
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Here in frehold Well, I had my first kiss at the ymca canteen on a friday night
I want to spit in the face of these Badlands, you gotta live it every day
In the garden of a thousand sighs
To that place where You can't remember
So raise up your glasses and let me hear your voices call
Oh mama mama mama come quick
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
Got a head-on collision
But there's a pretty little thing
I search for a connection in some new eyes
To none, baby, but the brave
And baby that's all
I'm just living in a dump like this
Girl, I don't give a damn
With the Tenth Avenue freeze-out
I'm happy when I'm in your arms
I don't care what they say
Cover me, come on baby, cover me
From your front porch to my front seat
As the evening's underway
No one baby,no one but the brave Cynthia, when you come walkin' by
This whole world is rough, it's just getting rougher
But there's a secret garden she hides She'll let you in her car
I'd be proud if you would wear my name Oh
Point blank
But these promises we make at night, oh that's all they are.
It's up to me and you
Sent me off to a foreign land
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Better days with a girl like you Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss
Ain't good enough for you You complain the way I love you at night
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
If you've ever seen a one trick pony then you've seen me
And they made the cannon balls
There was a lot of fights between the black and white
Come on up for the rising tonight Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li Two, three, four Have you ever seen a one trick pony in the field so happy and free?
Pass me by Frankie's Diner's
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
Darling to say when
Ooh yeah
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl You know she thrills me with all her charms
Troubled times had come
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block
And it's a thin thin line
That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact
And I'd dump 'em on her feet
Where everything you want
And Rosie, you're the one Rosalita, jump a little higher
And you can't forget She'll lead you down a path
Little girl you fell You grew up where young girls they grow up fast
(Come on boys!) Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Prove it all night
Two hearts girl get the job done
I've been around a time or two
And tempt the hands of fate
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth Well now everything dies baby that's a fact
Shot straight through the heart Yeah point blank
And tonight you'll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike
'Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world
As the price you've gotta pay
Ain't nobody like to be alone Everybody's got a hungry heart
I'm half a party in a one dog town
Here right behind that big red maple in freehold
With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks
We learned more from a three-minute record, baby
Wait for me Yeah, I'll wait for you
She knows that I'd give
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
Should I fall behind
Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
But your heart stays cool Romeo and Juliet
She's the one That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark,
Tell me can you ask for anything more? Have you ever seen a scarecrow filled with nothing but dust and wheat?
Don't you shut out the light
And should I fall behind
We gotta get out while we're young
Waiting for the King
So prove it all night
Two hearts are better than one Oh, two hearts are better than one
Well I musta done a hundred and ten through Michigan County that night
But come the wee wee hours
If you've ever seen a one-legged man then you've seen me Well now you may think I'm foolish
I bought some flowers and I waited at your door
I woke and you were missing
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
Baby you and me
They say in the end true love prevails
From underneath our willow
We're the same sad story that's a fact
On every link was Jesus' name
Pay me my money down As soon as the boat was clear of the bar,
I learned you get what you can get
I want a million different voices speaking in tongues This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
And your words come back to me
He couldn't move his hands [Chorus]
Cynthia, I wonder do you understand
Who's wrong baby who's right
It was out at the crossroads, down 'round Willow bank
Baby I just know that there is You can't start a fire
But my love is bigger than a Honda
Seen a little girl crying along the way
And turning his heart to stone
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Ooh...growin' up
From the coastline to the city, all the little pretties raise their hands
Yeah searchin' for a mystery train
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd, but when they said, "Pull down," I pulled up
Back then in freehold Well, something broke my daddy's back in freehold
And when I find you there's gonna be just one thing that you gotta know One thing you gotta know My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
La la la la, la la la la la la la
Now I just act like I don't remember
'Cause she let fly with an iron toe
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment
Happy in each other's kiss
It's just you and I my friend
I always done an honest job, as honest as I could
Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away
That's what makes us great
From sea to shining sea And they all have a dream
Oh, but you and I know what this world can do
Girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price Prove it all night
And can he do to you the things that I do, oh no
But girl I know you're a liar
And baby without check
'Til he rules everything
Wait for me Now everyone dreams of love lasting and true
Don't make much for tragedy
Lovers they walk by
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
With you, with you, with you, with you All right boys keep it rocking now
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal Get up mule, here comes a lock
It's a walk on, walk on
I'll be there to guide you when trouble walks beside you
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
I'm the same old story same old act
And you came out, didn't want to see me no more Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself Now you play the loving woman
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Well I gotta be pretty naive to believe in you
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Cause I got me a promise
Low bridge, we're coming to a town You got your book baby with all your fears
Pharaoh's army got drowned
Before the darkness falls I heard the wind rustling through the trees
Everybody's got a hungry heart Everybody needs a place to rest
Happy when I taste your kiss
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth, but I got me a nice little place in the stars
Hiring man said "son if it was up to me"
Well 'round here baby
'Cause without you my life just isn't the same
That you never read a book
Sky of mercy, sky of fear (a dream of life)
Oh down to the river we'd ride Then I got Mary pregnant
I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm
Hey hey hey hey The runway rushed up at him as he felt the wheels touch down
I'm gonna push my way through that crowd
His pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back down at the factory [Chorus] Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.
Maria espenoza tell me where are you tonight?
I'll take the faith the daylight brings
But into her secret garden, don't think twice You've gone a million miles
That what she wants is me Oh, and I want her so
I got a new suit of clothes a pretty red rose
I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
And she kissed me just right, like only a lonely angel can
Missed that soul that he thought he had
I catch him when he's strayin', teach him how to walk that line
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run Yes, girl we were Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
Don't get me wrong, I ain't puttin' anybody down
Neon sign spinnin' round
and all you want to do is believe her
Just another lost number in a file
Sky of memory and shadow (a dream of life)
I said yeah, yeah, alright
And then it all falls apart
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
I've been down that road before
Come on now baby gimme just one look You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
Don't worry darling, it'll slip your mind I know you think you'd never be mine
Point blank, you're walkin' in the sights
Can return to the past
Straight out of freehold Well, tex, rest in peace, and marion gave us kids a hand in freehold
I'm happy in a love like this In a world of doubt and fear
For hearts of stone If there was something, baby,
But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
We've given each other some hard lessons lately
I m happy in a love like this We said we'd walk together baby come what may
And you try so hard to see
Now sir you tell me the world's changed
Until the world falls apart
Baby we were born to run Oh honey, tramps like us
Glory days, glory days Well alright oo yeah
'Bout wanting somebody, oh so bad
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
And try to make an honest stand
I would not do heavens work well
They just stand back and let it all be
Maybe your other boyfriends
Two hearts are better than one Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes
A rich man in a poor man's shirt
I see the lonely ribbon in your hair
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Little girl that's a fact
I don't understand, there's nothing I can do
And sell it as a fact
Tell me, baby, do you mind
Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms
I wish I could babe
Lift me up darling
No one knows where you live
Can't see nothin' coming up behind
Ohh ohh ohh Here in north east Ohio
And this is what she said: "Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips
I pray the devil comes and takes me
Just gettin' beaten, and then playin' again
Hell, I still get a good one off once in a while
My hometown
Glory days, glory days Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Tomorrow is our sailing day,
Back in eighteen-o-three
Your smile girl, brings the mornin' light to my eyes
Is there a difference I can make? [Chorus]
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
Baby I got my facts
I'll never let her go, no, no, no
Well listen to me Janey don't you lose heart
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
If you come knockin' late at night
'Cause I'm stuck in traffic down here on fifty third street
And said, "Anybody want to go on up to Greasy Lake?
Now here I am down in Kingstown again Everybody's got a hungry heart
Some day your crying girl will end
But you should know better than to think that you
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Like we said it never would
I just want to feel some rhythm
But this ain't no dream we're living through tonight
The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men
Mmm she ain't lookin' to married
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
To stop singin', baby, and salute your style
Seven-hundred tons of metal a day
Your key in the door, your voice in the hall
Bring on your wrecking ball (bring on your wrecking ball)
Pay me or go to jail,
Now I'm ready to grow young again
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
Here in freehold Well, I got a good catholic education here in freehold
And you explain there's other boys out there
Searchin everywhere I go
That brings this fair city light
And my clothes don't fit me no more,
Got laid and had my first beer
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
There was no place for sorrow
Rosalita, you're my stone desire Hey hey hey hey
Or some good-lookin' Joe
O Mary don't Woke up this morning my house was cold
I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet
To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell The Rangers had a homecoming
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch
Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin'
Lost in the darkness of our love
And my machine, she's a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
But he ain't singin'
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
They're still there, he's all gone He had a woman he loved in Saigon
Let them melt, let them fire
Look in their eyes, Ma, and you'll see me"
Seem like the whole world walking pretty and you can't find the room to move
This old world is gonna rock
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bone Billy, they'll be coming up for air
Instead of opening the gate
Mom would put things on my plate
His mama said "Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me"
I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come
A notion deep inside
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right He was just blinded by the light
And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again..
Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode
I'll prove it all night
I can feel myself fading away,
You say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes
Your hometown Last night me and Kate we laid in bed
Crushin' the last lone American night This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
you're lyin' all dressed up on the bed baby fast asleep Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire Tell me now baby is he good to you
Taconite, coke and limestone
I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late.
All night You and me we were the pretenders
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
Don't make no difference what nobody says
I just want to feel your rhythm
And you'll find once again Two hearts are better than one
My hometown Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Just as you turn away
He stood out on the blacktop and took a taxi into town
George and me started up a little rock and roll band in freehold
But in the end true love can't be no fairytale
Tonight She'll let you in her house
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
Trapped, oh yeah I'm trapped, oh yeah
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
I've seen enough I ain't gonna see any more,
Fighting off the Viet Cong
Should I go crazy, blow all my money and ruin my life, well, at least i'll
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
Make my way through this darkness
Now he's got a broken jaw
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going Everybody's got a hungry heart
Go ahead, I don't mind the act
Shelter line stretching 'round the corner
But all I'm thinkin' is
And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray
That's what I wanna do Bedtime, hold tight, love me just a little bit
And someday I'll walk out of here again
If the words you say are right If you pay the price
D'you hear them guys talkin'
I wake at night and reach to find you near
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
A job that'd suit the devil as well
On the streets of Philadelphia On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert
I was walking in, he was walking out
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill
Take your best shot, let me see what you've got, bring on your wrecking ball One, two, one two three four! We met out on open streets
Went down to see my V.A. man
They say you gotta stay hungry
I bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
And a little paint You might need somethin' to hold on to
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down Well the street lights shine
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
We let it all slip away
Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back
Turn around the corner, things got real quiet real fast
We'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline
To my hometown
When I look at myself I don't see
Over the Jersey state line
He ran into the lake in just his socks and his shirt
'Til you've got down on your knees and tasted A red headed woman
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Like a cross over the lost and found Fluorescent lights
Fire Well, we bursted out of class
Without you I'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat
I just want to feel your rhythm I stood stone-like at midnight, suspended in my masquerade
They come from everywhere
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Have you ever seen a one-armed man punching at nothing but the breeze?
Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, I'm talking 'bout a
There in freehold Well, I still got a lot of good friends right here in town
To the coal mines of Appalacchia
Then smokestacks reachin' like the arms of god
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Or at least it'll help you really feel it"
He said, "Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at
Who'll say you ain't fine
Missing... Last night I dreamed the sky went black
Come on!
Rich man want to be king
I just like knowin' cynthia, you exist at all
Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'
There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this
Oh, point blank
And my fear up inside of me
Kept 'em hotter than hell
Of soft refusal and then surrender
Well, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes
On my back's a sixty pound stone
We took what we had and baby we ran
Like little white lies you tell to ease the pain
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
And when those mean days come along
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
Oh, stand right up and let her shoot through you
Oh strong enough to save something
Well come on over here and hug me
Listen to me Janey don't you lose heart
Did you forget how to love
I'm happy in a love like this There's a house upon a distant hill
Just searchin' for a world with some soul This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
I want pounding drums
With her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
I got a bottle of rosé so let's try it
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
But what they asked baby wasn't right
To make Candy mine
And on all the promises That always end up point blank
Every face on that crowded floor
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal A friend of mine once got her sore
And when you go the hurt you leave
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
I ain't going out there no more This whole world is out there just trying to score
Oh, nothing but a Tenth
That won this country's wars
I don't know But it was like we held a noose
Man turns his back on his family, he just ain't no good I thought I heard the Captain say,
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Sit down," I stood up
Wait for me (J.& N. Cassidy) When I was a little kid
I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know
When I look in your eyes
Like a catfish dancin' on the end of my line Sky of blackness and sorrow (a dream of life)
Into the palm of my hand
But do I really feel the way I feel? Walking in Memphis
You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor
Meet me in the fields out behind the dynamo
You criticize about me endlessly
All you gotta do is say yes
While it was all just slippin' away
Lifts away this night
If we stay in, you say what are we living for
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Pink Cadillac She'll let you in her house
I'll rise in the morning
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row
But a time comes when two people should think of these things
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And alligator eyes
But I just can't see
The band was playin' loud and you were shoutin' somethin' in my ear
Hey man there's only one thing
I ain't got much sense but I still got my feet And the girls in their summer clothes
Like soldiers in the winter's night
And girl I'll prove it all night for you Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist
Ah, on a night like this
If I could take one moment into my hands
My nerves all jumpin'
But it's the last time that she's gonna be ridin' with me You can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother would
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
To go and kill the yellow man Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.
And her eyes will say
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
You been shot in the back
I said, "I'm feeling slightly ill
Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
Well, everybody better move over, that's all
I don't understand ityou ain't pretty at all
Because a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And dedicate it to freehold
You say you don't love me
There's always somebody tempting
Sky of glory and sadness (a dream of life)
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
Pay me my money down If I'd been a rich man's son,
So use it, Rosie, that's what it's there for Rosalita, jump a little higher
No retreat, baby, no surrender
I'm ten years burning down the road
You're all dressed up in blue
Your heart like a diamond shone
Say hey, hey, hey, what you say Sherry Darlin' Well my soul checked out missing as I sat listening
Well, we learned pretty quick how to rock
I catch him when he's strayin', like any brother would
Where it's headed everybody knows
And I know somewhere I will find the key Well, it seems like I've been playing your game way too long
Sherry we can run with our arms open wide before the tide
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
I ate it all in bed
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
No, none baby but the brave
So if you got the guts mister, yeah if you've got the balls
And blondes are fun
We just sit around talking about the old times,
For the same old played out scenes
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
Since you came down the line
Cynthia, when you pass it seems
We danced as the evening sky faded to black
These are better days it's true
Now tonight once more I search
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
Another battle in our dirty little war
One more trip and we'll go
Honey I'm tougher than the rest Well it ain't no secret
Move slowly across the sky
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
We pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks
That's what makes us great [Verse 2]
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
Yeah there's better days shining through
That true, true love was just a lie
But when it comes to getting the dirty job done I'll take a red headed woman
Welcome to the new world order
She'll let you come just far enough
I'm waitin' on a sunny day Without you I'm workin' with the rain fallin' down
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank Well I chased him through them county roads
There's better days shining through Now a life of leisure and pirate's treasure
A thousand miles
My little girl gives me everything
Hey hey hey hey
Spending all my money
So Rosie, come out tonight, little baby, come out tonight
But I probably will
What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie
But then one day she made this soup
Right between the pretty lies you fell
Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door
I know that girl no longer exists
I want to find one place
That's why I'll keep searching 'til I find my special one Two hearts are better than one
But I just can't sleep
I'm thirty five we got a boy of our own now
Only you, can cool my desire
I'll wait for you
Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad Now Tom said, "Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
Well your kisses they burn
And they tempt you with the pleasures
He said "son, don't you understand" I had a brother at Khe Sahn
My only faith's in the broken bones and bruises I display Have you ever seen a one-legged man trying to dance his way free?
She reminds me of you
I'm gonna ride it
Through the mud and the beer, and the blood and the cheers, I've seen champions come and go
O Mary don't you weep Brothers and sisters don't you cry
Is doing with me
I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake
Monkey legs and buzzard eggs
Stir 'em all together
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
But your words they lie
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis Now, Muriel plays piano every Friday at the Hollywood
Or a decent job or a helping hand
And into the river we'd dive
I get a call on the shortwave, Franky's in trouble downtown
Honey I'm tougher than the rest Some girls they want a handsome Dan
It's just you and me tonight Tell me, in a world without pity
No one baby but the brave
Hold you once more and not go anywhere
Until the sun's torn from the sky
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal We'd better look around for a job, old gal
Explode and tear this whole town apart
What a woman like you
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal Where would I be if I lost my pal?
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
I know this to be true
And when this dirty world has been cold to you
Instead of pumpin' gas I dreamed of you
Big green eyes that look like, son
In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves
And the boys try to look so hard
Jacket's on, I'm out the door
I never put my faith
Ooh...growin' up The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
Come from something that was so good
He can decide whose dreams will live
The man I wanted to be
Yeah cynthia Well now you ain't the finest thing I'll never have
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down Well hold still now darlin'
You just stood there and held me, then you started dancin' slow
Had to get away from those fools
(And kid, you better get the picture)
Well I've tried so hard baby
All that I want, all that I live
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight
Led to an awful lot of masturbation here in freehold
No home, no job, no peace, no rest Well the highway is alive tonight
Bring on your wrecking ball One, two, one two three four! Yeah we know that come tomorrow, none of this will be here
Guarding over the love that they bring
If you've ever seen a one-armed man then you've seen me Then you've seen me, I come and stand at every door
There's a girl standin' by the band
But they wind up wounded, not even dead
On their arm some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo
Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell
Everybody's got a hungry heart I see you walking, baby, down the street
Your words say split
Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks "fill?"
Pink Cadillac
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
In a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path
Well go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time
Woah oh woah oh woah oh
Logic defies how you get stuck with me
Back in high school
Never go hungry I guess
Hey! Hey! Hey!
To get a dirty job done Tight skirt, strawberry hair
I'd sit on the river and watch it run,
All night
You're an inspirin' sight
I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired
Where everything you need
And all the love I've thrown away and lost, I'm longing for again.
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands
Hey baby Well, it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again
Down in Jungleland In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
On the streets of Philadelphia I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone,
O Mary don't weep Well Moses stood on the Red Sea shore
All duded up for Saturday night
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
No one baby but the brave Now in dreams these nights I see you my friend
You and your baby on a Saturday night
In number one by one
Everybody's got a hungry heart I met her in a Kingstown bar
And they'll be carving you up alright
Here darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy come on the 0hio works
And they're so fine but so out of reach
They've made their choices and they'll never know
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
They'll be good times by and by
I reached for you, my arms went to stone
Maybe you could save my life In just a glance
Show me somebody who ain't
O Mary don't weep Well old Mr. Satan he got mad
