Roll softly
Jesus will carry you through Shun evil companions, bad language disdain
A long, lonely time And time goes by so slowly
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through Oh, ask the Savior to help you

Sometimes I hold my arms and I say,
And I'd wait for you all night (oh)

Trying to sleep, trying my find my way through I get down on my knees
Somebody stop the rain

Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me.

This little country boy
And I would still choose you Do it all over
I'm tired of the bright ideas about leavin' me...
Let's stay together
My darling love for my life [Chorus] Stardust blowing in the wind
I like kissing you
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby,
Everything will be alright alright We'll see you there when we get there
Layin' all my troubles down, Here I am, baby,
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow And how can you mend a broken heart?
Before I can make your sweet love mine, oh baby
Nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you
You're everything I hoped for
If you're broken down
Let me tell you a thing...
The other girl is making me do wrong
Love and happiness (love and happiness) Hey, hey, hey, hey

Let me tell you one thing
I'm yours, I'm yours to keep, babe
And all the changes we've been through
Cause you made me a brand new man But I'm missing you so, I can't let you
Thou preparest a table
I'll love you through the night Would you chauffeur me till noon
When darkness gather 'round me
If I had a light to give
Blowing in the wind
Stop and look at the big wheel roll I can't explain this feeling
Don't wanna say anything
I'm livin' for you... givin' for you... givin' for you...
We got to leave the guns at home
Let's do this one more time

Is all right with me
Is what I need
Comfort, strengthen and keep you
I'm wild about you baby,
Girl, you're the key to my happiness,
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love Standing on the edge of the world
Bring it in bring it in what? bring in the verse Listen up 'cause there ain't nothing funny
Just one more time
Would be roses all around
Your love divine, oh its too much baby
What makes the world go round?
Don't think about it twice tonight Don't get on that train
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever? Please take my love, that's all I have to give

Its just for me, for me, for me
Whatever I do

Oh, no matter,
Thank you, thank you I can't believe that it's real,

Someone's on the phone
I've been trying for such a long time Let me tell you that

Rolling softly against my window
Take the bread out of my hand
There ain't nothing in this world we can't do
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
Slowly drivin' me out of my mind, oh ho, baby, yeah
So why'd you take your love away from me [Chorus:Repeat x2] Always talk about love, what do you know
You won't ever have to worry no, One more thing, you just can't trust everybody,
I don't know the reason why
It's a beautiful thing I can't stop
Gave me wings to fly above
Let her go, let's go
You are so beautiful
What is this feelin'? Doo-doo-doo Doo-doo
If you love me like you say you do,
And we all got to take a stand Chorus
Power of love

The stake points in this game
Are you still mine? I need your love, I need your love
In my arms and hold you
But I love you still baby, baby Why cant you tell that I love you
Oh baby... Everything's gonna be alright now
And I knew the way that I was, I wouldn't be round too long

I haven't been a true man for so long,
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
If I told you it ain't no fun to me

Through the grapevine

A burning deep down inside,
You don't want me no more,
I've hoped for, yeah
Ohh, I, I feel like going on, yes I do
Just you take your time Do you remember when

It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
(Beautiful, beautiful) And I, I wanna touch you, baby

Even in the mornin' when I rise
About love

Loving you whether, whether
Somebody to see me
I'm so tired of on my own,
Smoke stacks, signal your love
I've been thinking about you baby something awful,
You got the love I need baby
But God, blessed our love
And he just winds up knockin' me
Jesus is waiting, hey yeah
Through many drunken country bars

Knowin' thing with you and me ain't right, no My love, love, love, my love, love

Oh I, you see, I can make the seasons change
Oh no

How you do the things you do, yeah
Disregarding your love
Baby, not tonight Listen, I'm in love with you
Oh, I give your name the praise
You're in changing times You're perfect to me, more than my eyes can see
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad Why, why some people break up
To do the things that you want to do,
It's tough for me, oh baby,
These lives we'll lead without a car
There is no need
Just waiting in the rain
Cause they're telling me [Chorus] When I think about yesterday
Come on
Everything started flowing my way I just love you, really I just love you for yourself
On this magic road, if you turn on and off the bulb
You know it's always been that way (Ooh yeah, now)
I don't have the Eiffel tower, silver or gold
Mm [Chorus]
For you, for you, I want it for you You make my dreams
Right up ahead in front of me, yeah but
Reggae I remember that I had to
And now every touch, is too much baby
Seems like it's gonna keep rainin'
Nothing's like this man's desire
But it ain't no fun to me, no, no, no
Now I know I've got a friend
Your love is just for me for me
You can even be a superstar on this magic road What is this I see? Oh my, my, my, my
But maybe time will bring us together And I can be such a happy fella
People trying to ease the pain
What if I remember that's the same thing that you told me it was lonely yes
Say hello never say bye bye We'll have a good time, no, let's have a good time
But spend my life holding you and lovin' you... Oh...
My heart was lost and now it's found
It's all I gotta say, somebody understand here
Let's stay,(let's stay together) let's stay together
Or cast me aside
You can leave me now and walk away
I've been waitin' on you, hey Oh, baby, where did you go
Hey, hey, hey
And I, I wanna love ya baby
No matter what my friends say
Let's do it one more time
I can fly like a bird in the sky
Because you know, she's always there Never, never found me a girl
(On this magic road) They don't have what you have
I've been gone so long I know what to do
In the morning (time)
Every word is true
Am I in love to stay?
I'm layin' for you... prayin' for you... workin' for you...
Baby, I've got something to say, my dear
All the road is free, come and go with me
Make you come home early
For His name's sake. Surely goodness and loving kindness
But let me say before I forget,
Stay with me Stay with me, my dear
You ought to be with me until I die You ought to be with me until I die I don't want to waste my time
Well it seems to me
I don't know why love should end Stardust in the sky
And the love is getting you through it Simply beautiful [Repeats] Spending my day thinkin' 'bout you girl
There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind
I'm so glad you're mine Hey hey hey hey
Let's just be glad
Walk out and say goodbye away from me... Oh...
I'm over a twenty one,
Baby, why did it take so long
