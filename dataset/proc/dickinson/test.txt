And groped delirious, for morn.
Edited by two of her friends
His best Norwegian wines.
I heard the buckle snap,
I asked no other thing,
That you, so late, consider me,
Carried by men to-day,
Our feet reluctant led.
How cordial is the mystery!
Your breath has time to straighten,
For fear it be dispelled.
Unfitted by an instant's grace
    The homelier time behind.
Is bliss, then, such abyss
REFUGE.
Candid in May,
I envy seas whereon he rides,
Covert in April,
When Plato was a certainty.
I like to see it lap the miles,
Is every one I meet.
'T was this on tables I had seen,
My second rank, too small the first,
Beyond my power to deem, —
Maintain by accident
To fit its sides, and crawl between,
A deeper twilight on the lawn;
Is but the gleam concomitant
Oh, if there may departing be
At the drowsiest?
So go your way and I'll go mine, —
The grass does not appear afraid;
Not any nearer for the child
On this long storm the rainbow rose,
Regards with patriot love.
   And little boys besides;
Prithee, my pretty housewives!
A something in a summer's day,
And leave me standing there.
None evade this crown.
When all the children sleep
To that odd fork in Being's road,
personal origin. It is more than probable that it was
The want of diadems!
Was ever idleness like this?
The sunrise shook from fold,
Domenichino dropped the pencil,
'T was such a greedy, greedy wave
Recordless, but for them.
   Retrieve thine industry.
Haste! lest while you're lagging,
A little weather-worn,
   My bonnet but to tie,
MOTHER NATURE.
A duchess were too common
Upon a dandelion's sleeve —
How glad I am!
Or has it feathers like a bird,
This, the signal woe!
   Is not a lonesome way,
The maple wears a gayer scarf,
Yet, never, in extremity,
Then knit, and passed
   I rose, — it followed me;
Will there really be a morning?
   I, lost, was passing by, —
Beetle at the candle,
   It feels so old a pain.
As 't were a tropic show.
I think the hemlock likes to stand
Then sprang before the hills
THE WOODPECKER.
So gradual the grace,
Portraits are to daily faces
Dungeons may call, and guns implore;
And started all abroad;
Less skilful than Leverrier
He will tell me what Peter promised,
   Is a soul 'forgot'!
She went as quiet as the dew
On her divine majority
Ascended from our vision
   Of toads and men, —
Bait it with the balsam,
THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.
Contracting in a field
I'll put a trinket on.
SHIPWRECK.
Adjusted in the tomb,
A cheek is always redder
Lest that should conquer me;
   Which lead the seasons by,
It is a faded meat.
Except for its marauding hand,
To know just how he suffered would be dear;
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
Like stone.
The hillsides must not know it,
And I esteemed all poverty,
He fumbles at your spirit
Convicted of itself.
Each life converges to some centre
   Like morning glory
TRIUMPHANT.
No other was denied.
I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.
   Proud little heart!
Or cart of butterfly.
When everything that ticked has stopped,
And what a privilege to be
For that was thine before;
To hold my life, and hold my ears,
Or help one fainting robin
So drunk, he disavows it
Some burning noon go dry!
As far from time as history,
   Bold it were to die
Just a look at the horses —
   A crescent still abides,
A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,
It's like the woods,
It's so unkind of science
The wagons quickened on the streets,
I feel as if the grass were pleased
This limitless hyperbole
An anguish at the mention,
'T is an instant's play,
DAY'S PARLOR.
For whom I robbed the dingle,
   Reflex holiday.
   Not that we tire of thee,
Which like the moon, some turbid night,
LI.
That scalds me now, that scalds me now.
Your consciousness and me.
A ROSE.
Of heaven above the firmest proof
His gait was soundless, like the bird,
But I could never sell.
And pass, escaped, to thee?
I'd brush the summer by
And bow to everything;
So whether it be rune,
As if it held but the might of a child;
It's like the bee, —
Or dome of worm,
Recollect the way, —
Some epauletted brother
'T was the new liquor, —
They 'll carry him!
So clear, of victory,
   By contrast with the love.
The needle to the north degree
SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
The other peep
As if the cloud that instant slit
There came a purple creature
Who never thirsted, flagons
So instead of getting to heaven at last,
Her eye unto the summer dew
Day rattles, too,
I hope the children there
   So larger to my eyes
   Could bounty but remain
XXVII.
   Thy flower forevermore!
The rose did caper on her cheek,
I will not name it in the street,
Then shuts the door;
UNRETURNING.
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
As 't were a spur upon the soul,
   Not to partake thy passion, my humility.
Itself its sovereign, of itself
Or cool one pain,
On such a night, or such a night,
Death is like the insect
Dwell timidly with thee!
That skirts the acres of perhaps,
Their glory nought to me;
If ruff it was of dame
'T was short to cross the sea
FORBIDDEN FRUIT.
The porter of my father's lodge
'T is a fond ambush,
   Then space began to toll
Might some one else so learned be,
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'
Just a drop!
And awe was all we could feel.
But she slept.
And pain is missed in praise.
THE ORIOLE.
The wardrobe of our Lord.
Remembered as the mile
   When there's no one here, —
   My mind was going numb.
And notwithstanding bee that worked,
Soft fall the sounds of Eden
A WELL.
Hands bustled at the moorings —
Time's sublimest target
Birds, hours, the bumble-bee:
I could not die with you,
Unto the saints' slow diligence
For two divided, briefly,
Himself could have the skies.
And then I wanted to get out,
I keep it staying at home,
Of dawn the ancestor.
The germ of alibi;
To the immortal tune, —
That don't remember you?
Chastened, as to the chapel,
   By physiognomy.
Who is to blame? The weaver?
Why, God would be content
Our blank in scorning.
Aground, upon the sands.
I knew no more of want or cold,
A long, long yellow on the lawn,
Were I with thee,
Till we are less afraid;
   From the early sum,
   With beclouded eyes!
Except the heaven had come so near,
It's safer so.
Went up from the Potomac,
A clock stopped — not the mantel's;
With such severity,
That image satisfies.
   I used to when a boy.
As lowly spices gone to sleep,
Inaudible, indeed,
   And see!
DEED.
   While, like a guard between,
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
A difference, a daisy,
Of its condensed despatch.
A color stands abroad
With a departing, sapphire feature,
The news would strike me dead!
Of me, himself was shy;
Brewed from decades of agony!
   Nor once look up for noon?
An enemy could send.
    Can summon every face.
As he, defeated, dying,
XXVI.
The dying need but little, dear, —
That licked it from the coast;
Bless God, he went as soldiers,
Than this great purchaser suspect,
   Upon the world below.
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
The grass divides as with a comb,
And mine the distant sea, —
TWO WORLDS.
   The chemist may repay,
The morning lit, the birds arose;
Without a chance or spar,
THE CONTRACT.
And claim the rank to die!
Lock the door!
What could it hinder so, to say?
Almost contented
Aforetime in my hat,
Denominated "Death," —
MABEL LOOMIS TODD
"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS."
Were as impossible as hand
Apart, intrinsic, stand,
Instead of morning! Hadst thou broached
The thought is quiet as a flake, —
By those who ne'er succeed.
Kept beating, beating, till I thought
A narrow wind complains all day
And therefore good.
Between the bliss and me.
The notice to the startled grass
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!
   Gracious unto none.
Some sailor, skirting foreign shores,
It dropped so low in my regard
Duties of gossamer,
But tens have won an all.
So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
And bathed them in the glee;
Unto a silent sky
Somewhat of nods, and somewhat of
Slipped quiet from its chair,
Complaining all the while
And see you freeze,
Like flowers that heard the tale of dews,
The lips I would have cooled, alas!
An anodyne so sweet,
And he no consolation
They perished in the seamless grass, —
The Tyrian would not come
Except for winds, provincial;
A SYLLABLE.
The eagle of his nest
I went to heaven, —
He was the faithful father
   Elate philosopher!
Degrades the dress I wear.
Wild nights should be
    MABEL LOOMIS TODD.
   Her cheek like beryl stone;
With duds of emerald!
     The lowliest career
In chrysoprase apartments hung,
And wandered in my face.
To see if time was there.
Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.
Bound to opposing lands.
That bells should joyful ring to tell
And thrown her furthest stone,
Unarmed if any meet her,
Upon the furthest slope we know;
Nor tell the loving forests
Thine eyes impose on me.
   The judgment perished, too.
As one that drunken stepped;
In it wait till judgment break
Is pungent evergreens;
   An independent one.
    I should have had the joy
Reimbursed my store.
An ecstasy of parting
A little farther on,
With shrill felicity
Upon a marge of snow;
And then you and I were silenter.
Lit with a ruby,
Along appointed sands.
Invests so mean a brow!
Past midnight, past the morning star!
THE DUEL.
Enamour in prospective,
Nor fire, for just my marble feet
Industrious until
The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
They'll recollect how cold I looked,
And row in nowhere all day long,
How very blithe the fingers
ESCAPE.
A sepal, petal, and a thorn
We trust, in plumed procession,
I the dart revere.
I woke and chid my honest fingers, —
Would overflow with pearl.
To see the little tippler
The saved will tell
   That lawful orchards mocks;
With hurried, few, express reports
The old, old sophistries of June, —
    Then crouch within the door.
You asked the company to tea,
Receives unblushingly!
ALMOST!
   As syllable from sound.
The smallest "robe" will fit me,
Heart, we will forget him!
Some say that bright majority
   Into what carbonates.
While I was fearing it, it came,
I thought that such were for the saints,
By what mystic mooring
Of time's uncertain wing,
By tropic hint, — some travelled bird
Accessible to thill of bee,
There knits a bolder one
I stepped from plank to plank
Could she have guessed that it would be;
One in the red array, —
   For such a foe as this!
And sunrise grows so near
Tradition suffer me
   And abrogate my bee,
At length the notice came.
Of chariots that him convey,
Behold his lost emolument
Capacious as the sea,
Neither patriarch nor pussy,
The rest of life to see!
And leave me just my A B C,
I gave myself to him,
A caper in the trees, —
At the setting sun;
A hurrying home of little men
When turning, hungry, lone,
   Ho! pilot, ho!
It is not of the bird
   I beheld her next,
Creation impotent to help,
A careless snatch, a ballad,
Except by butterflies,
Of woman and of wife.
A jealousy for her arose
Some industry must be,
Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying:
   Many sciences
Their faith the everlasting troth;
Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling —
'T is noon, my little maid, alas!
Tabernacle or tomb,
Much sense the starkest madness.
My little maid, 't is night; alas,
Bring me the sunset in a cup,
From inns of molten blue.
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?
Reverently to the hungry
It sickened fresh upon my sight
And saints to windows run,
Delight becomes pictorial
Do the blue havens by the hand
   The ones that cite her most
   Through centuries above,
Until the daffodil
Grant that repentance solemn
   Termed Thanksgiving day,
The little cage of 'Currer Bell,'
So you could see what moved them so.
And fleeter than a tare.
Oh, for a bee's experience
Thither I pilot thee, —
On schemes intent.
Practising sands.
There's a certain slant of light,
But bliss is sold just once;
And that was in the sod;
Only the soldered mouth can tell;
Blew out itself for fear.
For 't is his institution, —
And then, obscure with fog,
On this late morn the sun;
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
And that pale sustenance,
Then quiver down, with tufts of tune
To my quick ear the leaves conferred;
My childhood, and the string of spools
How some one treated him;
I bring thee proof:
A breeze
    With hammer and with blaze,
Being just asleep,
Whom I have never found
I will of you!
A Tyrian light the village fills;
Bred as we, among the mountains,
That which sings so, speaks so,
That yours and mine should be,
Where nature's temper cannot reach,
To pick another day.
If pride shall be in Paradise
STORM.
You there, I here,
What we touch the hems of
When the robins come,
LOVE'S HUMILITY.
The purple brook within the breast
Just to make bliss
A passage back, or two, to make
Just where the hectic stings!
   I groped upon his breast.
For frigid hour of mind.
And all those hills
The thinking how they walked alive,
SLEEPING.
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so
   The maddest, quickest by;
And the rest?
Or bees, that thought the summer's name
And now she turns her perfect face
Its infinite realms contain
And Beatrice wore
IN THE GARDEN.
Why joys so scantily disburse,
A vastness, as a neighbor, came, —
   The beggar and his queen;
Of the first league out from land?
To put the water back
The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes,—life and love and death. That "irresistible needle-touch," as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power. This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.
   Eternity until.
A few ascetic eyes, —
And I condemned to be
How mighty 't was, to stay
Beguiled of immortality,
   The exponent of breath.
That scalding one, "Sabachthani,"
At least to pray is left, is left.
As much abasheth me.
The rose will redden in the bog,
I, from agony!
There is a fitting a dismay,
The playthings of her life
A little brig I knew, —
The cricket sang,
External ghost,
For it would stop my breath,
And shadows tremble so?
And then I looked at them,
At such a curious earth!
And failed, and all the summer laughed.
An easy morning's ride.
    Prodigal of blue,
Repeal the beating ground.
We shall not want to use again
Decades of arrogance between
   The happy, happy leaves
Even as herself, O friend!
Let go a music, as of tunes
You cannot put a fire out;
How happy is the little stone
A privilege, I think,
   The universe her shoe,
You almost feel the date,
I'd count them on my hand,
Perusal to facilitate
    Have climbed the distant hill;
He doubtless did his best;
The breezes fetch along,
Past interview, and vow,
A mighty afternoon;
A half unconscious queen;
That we can touch the spaces,
Went past my simple shoe,
   Is summoned by the tides.
Then have I
The breezes madder play.
PHILOSOPHY.
And I choose — just a throne.
And past my apron and my belt,
THE SNOW.
So much that, did I meet the queen,
That such have died enables us
On such a day?
With clasps of chrysolite.
I'd wind the months in balls,
Pray gather me, Anemone,
Bees' exclusive coterie.
He comes just so far toward the town,
God permits industrious angels
To say good-by to men.
No universe, no laws.
Underneath their fine incisions
   Or if it be before,
Of persons outside windows,
   And so the night became.
   And satisfied a leaf,
That others could exist
MARCH.
Must seek the neighboring life!
     The hospitable pall
None will.
I never saw a moor,
   Her tarrying unknown;
But now, all ignorant of the length
And split their pods of flame.
A jar across the flowers goes,
   ''T was only a balloon.'
Not all pianos in the woods
Of one another's eyes.
Arcturus is his other name, —
His table 's spread too high for us
Nor lisp it at the table,
Some, too fragile for winter winds,
   In one consummate bill,
TIME'S LESSON.
       Like the June bee

A dog's belated feet

ROUGE ET NOIR.
   I learned its sweetness right.
BY THE SEA.
We talked between the rooms,
One mitred afternoon.
And then, as if the hands
To lives that stoop to notice mine
The mountain at a given distance
   Just when the grave and I
Her little rocking-chair to draw,
Confronting sudden pelf, —
No summer could for them;
None can avoid this purple,
No lifetime set on them,
    Oh, lagging yesterday!
   And undermined the years!
In seamless company.
The crowd retire with an oath
At the lone orthography
His laughter like the breeze
So when 't was time to see,
The Queen of Calvary.
    In her imperial round,
And all the dead lie down;
So unsuspected violets
Of amplitude, or awe,
The eyes of many elves.
The berry's cheek is plumper,
Its white foot tripped,
Till the children ask, "But the forty?
The last night that she lived,
No ruddy fires on the hearth,
That gentlemen so sprightly
It was the limit of my dream,
When butterflies renounce their drams,
With nosegays at the head and foot,
   And then consolidates, —
Upon the polar hem,
Earth would have been too much, I see,
Third Series
Indeed, I 'm too astonished
I've finished threading too.
The farthest thunder that I heard
DAWN.
There's been a death in the opposite house
A legacy of love
A smile suffused Jehovah's face;
   And now, removed from air,
   Contented as despair.
And hold the sunshine in its lap
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
The brain is just the weight of God,
Is shunned, we must admit it,
No eye hath seen and lived,
A minor nation celebrates
Permitted to commune this time,
Addeth to my degree;
   That I dare to tell?
Myself a millionnaire
       Lifts his light pinnace
Knock, recollect, for me!
Nor tie to earths to come,
It's sorer to believe!
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him
Land, ho! Eternity!
In this, as all, prevails.
Would the bee the harebell hallow
I fumbled at my nerve,
To bear them orchestra,
If such a little figure
   So slow and cautiously;
Until we met the solid town,
Could mortal lip divine
THE RAILWAY TRAIN.
By ear unheard,
The clovers understood.
In danger, other impetus
And he owned all the mourners now,
REAL.
Without the knowing why.
Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred
Till brooms fade softly into stars —
The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;
   And lay the marble tea,
   But what must be the smile
And life is over there
Lead the wandering sails.
To continents of summer,
I had rather wear her grace
   The morning it is new,
As by the dead we love to sit,
And this linnet flew!
He laboreth at every tree, —
And wonder we could care
Nor this behooveth me.
Burglar, banker, father,
Annihilate a single clause,
Nobody knows the place, —
And echoes, trains away,
MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.
For gentlemen who see;
Whose voices, trained below,
   How vast an one
The mail from Tunis, probably,
   We took the mystery.
   Bequeaths him to the night.
Too rapt with frost
An April but begun.
    So, Saviour, crucify.
Heaven is what I cannot reach!
If 't was a meaner size,
   Might yet reply!
Out of the foxglove's door,
RETROSPECT.
That maketh all things new.
Because that fearing it so long
Thine is the stillest night,
   On patriotic day,
   These gentlewomen are!
A memorial crumb.
Full purple is his state!
   For just this single time;
   Leads the chosen child;
Barbs has it, like a bee.
   Touching all the grass
   Upon this summer's day
     By boy descried,
   Then take my flower, pray!
   And left it in the sky.
That if the spirit like to hide,
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
A star not far enough to seek,
It then goes out an act,
Behind this soft eclipse!
DEATH.
It would suffice my prayer
I, softly plucking,
   That ever mason hewed;
LII.
And I, could I stand by
It has a garret also
   Extinct be every hum,
Ourself, behind ourself concealed,
   Sometimes almost more.
And sanctity are best.
   First time together thrown.
   A world must be
The house of supposition,
It fills with alabaster wool
And "You're hurt" exclaim!
Stands the sun so close and mighty
Behind the hill, the house behind, —
Went up a year this evening!
An arc alike inscrutable, —
   To stealthily belong?
We might look for him;
A something so transporting bright,
   They would not encore death.
A spider at his trade again;
My residence within
A few incisive mornings,
Of cautious melody.
And when the sun goes down
   And the world I used to know;
Balking our wit
But trifles look so trivial
NATURE'S CHANGES.
Until their time befalls.
Does not concern the bee;
When one who died for truth was lain
He sits erect in cabinets,
Each bound the other's crucifix,
Your inference therefrom!
THE MARTYRS.
Unnoticed as a single dew
THE SECRET.
   Unto the thought before,
His presence is enchantment,
Handle the adamantine fingers
Where no breakers roar,
Feels shorter than the day
How dim it sounds!
And made as he would eat me up
And cherubim and seraphim
A purple finger on the slope;
Denoted by the white;
That passed, an hour ago.
In his eternal chair,
To offer whom a chair
Discarded of the housewife,
TRIUMPH.
We never know how high we are
An added strut in chanticleer;
EVENING.
Fritters itself away!
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, —
A peace, as hemispheres at home, —
When March is scarcely on.
Harmless as streaks of meteor
To firmaments of sun,
She's 'sorry I am dead,' again,
I 'm glad I don't believe it,
A February day,
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;
I have a king who does not speak;
And then, those little anodynes
To strange, bright crowds of flowers,
Or only a divine.
To a heart in port, —
   That hovered there awhile.
In life's diverse bouquet,
Too rescued; fear too dim to me
And Immortality.
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Deals one imperial thunderbolt
Softened by Time's consummate plush,

His speech was like the push
Out upon the bay.
Their liquid feet go softly out
The brain is deeper than the sea,
   Acknowledged him a man.
If aught she missed in her new day
Who built this little Alban house
Yet a druidic difference
May be seen the sands among,
Her pretty speech, like drunken men,
   Like costumes grandsires wore.
Yet that pathetic pendulum
Say, sea,
FRIENDS.
   Remembered but by me.
Of last year's sundered tune.
If town it have, beyond itself,
Yield such an alcohol!
I envy light that wakes him,
Ascend in ceaseless carol,
   Subsists till Paradise.
Though I get home how late, how late!
XVIII.
When peace was far away;
Deliberate, as a duke would do
   Gush after gush, reserved for you;
O God, the other one!
   Upon a daily street,
   No more to do have I,
You left for me to hue;
   Why Paradise defer,
"Which in the valleys lie?"
And past my bodice too,
   From Nature's sentinels.
   Of those that stand alone,
And fitted to a frame,
Delayed till in its vest of snow
Till, his best step approaching,
The brooks laugh louder when I come,
It's all I have to bring to-day,
They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
Henceforth for her what holiday!
   Forever intervene!
Behold! Whose multitudes are these?
An awful tempest mashed the air,
And passed their curtains by.
   Or intimates it there;
As take the tale for true
   What portion of me I
SECRETS.
Through which men reach
Ah, bugle, by my window,
This was in the white of the year,
   That was in the green,
I meant to tell her how I longed
Playmates, and holidays, and nuts,
And the earth, they tell me,
And somebody has lost the face
   Describing in the air
And I a pauper go;
Then a silence suffuses the story,
For my little damask maid.
But, till the merchant buy,
As flavors cheer retarded guests
For each beloved hour
Batschia in the blanket red,
Stare vacant into mine
A neighbor and a warrior too,
   A hateful, hard, successful face,
    "Because, sir, love is sweet!"
Sneer — "Where?"
Whereas I took the butterfly
That leaves this neighbor out.
The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes.
   To stay as if, or go.
Of the elder dead.
Minutest of mankind might be.
Excellent and fair.
That not a beggar would accept,
   'A soul has gone to God,'
The distant strains of triumph
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!
   Sweep vale, and hill, and tree!
Could I but ride indefinite,
I would not, if I could,
I offer thee
There is no frigate like a book
Raffle for my soul.
Give balm to giants,
The sweeping up the heart,
   The proudest trees.
Was physiognomy.
Repairing everywhere,
Of a tint so lustrous meek.
The tidy breezes with their brooms
On fence and roof and twig.
I ever had, but one;
An instinct for the hoar, the bald,
As laces just reveal the surge,

Still fable, in the isles of spice,
For privilege of sod and sun,
From cocoon forth a butterfly
But peers beyond her mesh,
   The lightning was as new
All these did conquer; but the ones
To ponder little workmanships

Almost a powdered footman
We brethren are," he said.
   Desire's perfect goal,
Is large as thine.
Soft sauntered through the village,
   But not a remedy.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
He were superfluous every day,
Some things that stay there be, —
    Of life's penurious round;
   Than knowing it is here.
The birds and I had often shared
Or priests adjust the symbols
Before were cities, but between,
Without commander, countless, still,
Were greater than itself, though he
A heaven not so large as yours,
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
   His remedy for care, —
And life hath immortality.
Nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,
To crew and you;
And blotted out the mills!
Nor noticed night did soft descend
Except a perished creature
And never stops at all,
I heard a fly buzz when I died;
But just for one to stipulate,
From spotted nooks, —
And silenced, as the awful sea
And blushing birds go down to drink,
A spirit, how doth it accost?
And if I don't, the little Bird
No ordinance is seen,
Phraseless, yet it stirs
That oppresses, like the weight
Soul, wilt thou toss again?
    A wind with fingers goes.
And subterfuge is done;
As stars that drop anonymous
What soft, cherubic creatures
That short, potential stir
And trades as briskly fly.
Whether by day abducted,
Venice could not show a cheek
And held my ears, and like a thief
A few prosaic days
And bowing with a mighty look
The lightning's jointed road,
And first pronounced "a fit."
The trampled steel that springs;
But that the little figure
But should the play
Hid heaven and earth from view.
The seasons must have turned
Upon an August day?
Present our meek escutcheon,
Or gold, who am the Prince of Mines;
We never know we go, — when we are going
I drop my heart, unshriven!
And then declines forever
   The undeveloped freight
If met in ether sea
So breathless till I passed her,
And tell each other how we sang
And then, excuse from pain;
Of the minutest cricket,
Her bodice rose and fell,
And workmen finished, one by one,
   And all the meadows wide.
   Like fallow article,
That men must slake in wilderness,
A summer afternoon, —
Awaited their low brows;
Of resurrection? Is the east
If I shouldn't be alive
   As if a duchess pass!
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
In shanties by the sides of roads;
Too costly for repairs.
   It's easy as a sign, —
And then — the wharf is still.
Whatever prank betides!
A stately, shriven company;
It is not bird, it has no nest;
The brain has corridors surpassing
Denying they have been.
Never did she lisp it,
Around its forehead bound.
With those same boots of lead, again.
And settled regions wild,
At period of going down —
I would not choose a book to know
       Before the school-boy
If the savans 'classify' them,
With specimens of song,
By people of degree,
This, and my heart, and all the bees
To such a modest clay,
Some rumor of delirium
Ring, for the scant salvation!
   As sponges, buckets do.
The gnash of northern winds
Just so far goes away.
   Permitted face to face to be;
A loosened spirit brings!
A sphere of simple green,
   This pendulum of snow;
   Some say.
Obtained my lodgings ere myself,
And who could reproduce the sun,
   Would be my final inch, —
   To rest, — to rest would be
    Whose anvil's even din
As if a kingdom cared!
Without apparent burden,
   You and I, to-night!
He touched me, so I live to know
Calls forth this spectral canticle,
   To punctuate the wall,
But gallanter, I know,
In broken mathematics
Sleep is supposed to be,
That devastated childhood's realm,
Betimes an oratorio,
It was too late for man,
   And mourners, to and fro,
A rich man might not notice it;
   At that grand 'Right hand'!
And coffers heaped with tears.
I thought how yellow it would look
In such a shining place!
PURPLE CLOVER.
And did the sunshine face his way?
That I did always love,
    That I could spell the prayer
And afternoon, and butterfly,
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"
The mountain sat upon the plain
But he is mastered now,
       Homesick for steadfast honey,
   For the one ship that struts the shore
WHO?
Impaled him on her fiercest stakes —
Just a dome of abyss is nodding
There seemed a purple stile
Loose the flood, you shall find it patent,
   Has simultaneous come, —
Who took the flag to-day
   Has never been employed
III. NATURE.
Without the formula of sound,
I should not dare to leave my friend,
How pomp surpassing ermine,
As if for you to choose,
   Just a bridge away;
   Gay little heart!
Aromatic, low,
WITH A FLOWER.
But just the primer to a life
Afraid to trust the morn
Did not talk of returning,
Bumblebees come,
Never a thimble more shall wear.
He will not be obliged to wait,
Her face is rounder than the moon,
No rack can torture me,
To tell your name the livelong day
   And if to mourn were gay,
   That night should be to thee
Her progress by the bee proclaimed
'T is almost consequence,
Done with the compass,
   Ourselves be not pursued.
   To notoriety.
   And bees abashless play,
Is aristocracy.
Eternity's white flag before,
And one, below this morning,
Inebriate of air am I,
   But dapperer, more sweet;
By souls of sanity,
The orchard sparkled like a Jew, —
   He trod upon the trees
It cannot be again.
Guides the little one predestined
Borne, without dissent of either,
On such a dawn, or such a dawn,
Because the winds would find it out,
An almanac's aware.
Her bed a funnelled stone,
THE PAST.
I left them in the ground.
All forests, stintless stars,
     Till it fell,
Had subjugated test,
So intimate have we become
A sailor's business is the shore,
Oh, some wise man from the skies!
   There Paradise is found!
THE WlND'S VISIT.
And they the daffodils!
Like mighty footlights burned the red
Fate following behind us bolts it,
"Creator! shall I bloom?"
   By the wizard sun!
In cave if I presumed to hide,
It's such a little thing to weep,
   When summer days are flown!
That you were coming, — I declare,
Who never lost, are unprepared
And a company — our pleasure
I 've met the thing before;
The wind tapped like a tired man,
One day is there of the series
Of their unthinking drums.
   Too sullied for the hell
And has her in a class.
To which the law entitled him.
My departing blossoms
For that old faded midnight
'T were easier for you
Not pursued by learnèd angels
In little wealths, — as girls could boast, —
Is daily drunken there.
Good-by to the life I used to live,
THE OUTLET.
I had not hoped before.
Flutter too far for me.
And visit only where I liked,
And now, before the door,
Here a mist, and there a mist,
And not a song pervades his lips,
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, —
The happy winds their timbrels took;
Ages beneath the mould.
An actual suffering strengthens,
The birds put up the bars to nests,
The complement of hell.
It sifts from leaden sieves,
If bees are few.
This humble tourist rose.
And then I heard them lift a box,
And stepped like flakes of snow.
Lest noon in everlasting night
APOCALYPSE.
   With rubies pelteth me;
   And subsequent to find
The lightning showed a yellow beak,
As berry of a mountain bush
They tell it to the hills —
Till it an antique fashion shows
   Of fingers going by.
And I became alone.
How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,
He never had but one;
And her capacity.
