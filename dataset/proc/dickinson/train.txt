Confided are his projects pink
What fortitude the soul contains,
   So still, so cool,
But this sort grieved myself, and so
Till broad as Buenos Ayre,
    Truly yours,
Be debonair! Be debonair!
Who failed to touch us all,
In the receipt. It was the distance
From a convenient grass,
At last, the lamps upon thy side,
Society.
If any ask me how,
Wisdom is more becoming viewed
A window opens like a pod,
   I could not see to see.
Forty gone down together
That they have done expecting me,
It listening, listening, went to sleep
That I could fear a door,
Who knocks? That April!
Angels, write "Promoted"
Occasionally rides;
As one encountered gentlefolk
   Wherever roams the day,
Talk with prudence to a beggar
On the bleakness of my lot
Her God her only throng.
For though they lock thee in the grave,
My gypsy face transfigured now
Revisiting the bog!
   Of Deity ashamed, —
The Alps neglect their curtains,
   To make me visible.
But she and Death, acquainted,
Whose invitation, knew you not
Rang loudest
As if I breathed superior air,
   With their dear retrospect.
Again he tapped — 't was flurriedly —
And wade in liberty?
The more convenient way, —
Guides still the sun along the crag
In sovereign, swerveless tune.
And gain the sky,
When August, burning low,
Experienced, who can pass
Celebrated part at table,
Immortal Alps look down,
To match the grandmamma,
I'm not afraid to know.
And leave the soul alone.
Existence's whole arc filled up
The summer lapsed away, —
Have ventured all upon a throw;
So thick upon the plain?"
Two bodies therefore be;
A swelling of the ground;
   Ascribe no less the praise;
   Did they forget thee?
IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.
I confidently see!
RETICENCE.
And — waking long before the dawn —
The red upon the hill
And failed to wake them up,
   Best when it's done, —
SIGHT.
Strange that the feet so precious charged
Stooping, plucking, sighing, flying;
A wounded deer leaps highest,
Some pale reporter from the awful doors
The palate of the hate departs;
She doth not wait for June;
And morn should beam,
But just before the snows
   When March is scarcely here
With shapeless, quivering prayer
'T is beggars banquets best define;
Provided it do hopeless hang,
Affords the sly presumption
'T was such a gallant, gallant sea
Lest I should insufficient prove
Where I proposed to go
And stand upon their heads!
She is held to-day, —
And why not this, if they?
She bent her docile sails;
The humming-birds aspire.
There's banishment from native eyes,
   And it were perjury!
And lighted with a match,
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
But if they only stay
The orchis binds her feather on
When landlords turn the drunken bee
Grief, hills, eternity:
They hear my unexpected knock.
The solemn contract of a life
His strategy
So we must keep apart,
I think just how my shape will rise
Than mayest thou,
The broadest land that grows
The creatures chuckled on the roofs
Known by the knoll,
I met one, — forgot my school-mates,
And the cycles wheel.
For an alighting mine.
LVII.
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.
Parched the flowers they bear along.
That will not state its sting.
To justify despair.
Can human nature not survive
Might dare to touch it now!
To a fine, pedantic sunshine
Who went to thank her;
   Or sunset's yellow play
The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones, everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong. The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date, the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy.
   Without oppress of toll;
THE CHARIOT.
Hate cannot harm
   I lost it in the sand,
I breathed enough to learn the trick,
Should the glee glaze
Grant, God, he charge the bravest
AT HOME.
Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H." must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th September, 1884, she wrote:—
   Conquers mortality.
   Their old forefathers sang.
WAITING.
   His furniture is love.
A THUNDER-STORM.
   But their competeless show
To stay the homesick, homesick feet
A bird came down the walk:
Sharp pittances of years,
Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness. Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic has said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession," it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare.
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,
   The son of ecstasy.
   In matters ratified?
Telling my tardy name, —
Things overlooked before,
Did they come back no more?"
I aimed my pebble, but myself
Bent to the water, shivered scarce,
Leaping like leopards to the sky,
How life's reverberation
"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here?"
For circumstance the same.
And butterflies desire;
That one so honest be extant
Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the April following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until this winter."
And like a bubble hie.
Whose dying eyes no country
VENTURES.
What will the solemn hemlock,
But what of that?
Odd secrets of the line to tell!
The solemn Alps,
Myself distinguished God.
These are the days when skies put on
When figures show their royal front
   Auspiciously withheld.
XLVI.
Save just a little place for me
THE WIND.
And then 't was put among the dust
   But decoyed may be.
Has it feet like water-lilies?
Of their imperial conduct,
With half a smile and half a spurn,
Refining these impatient ores
I simulate the breath so well,
So sailors say, on yesterday,
How the old steeples hand the scarlet,
THE HUMMING-BIRD.
Of mechlin, frames,
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
TO MARCH.
Upon a planet's bound.
Grandfather of the days is he,
   Chat of the 'early dead,'
Inherited with life,
APOTHEOSIS.
    To see that none is due?
Quaint or broken;
Or the earl an earl?
And put them each in separate drawers,
Their countenances bland
Himself, himself inform.
    We nearer steal to Thee, —
THE WHITE HEAT.
And then to dwell in sovereign barns,
Serpent cannot charm;
And satisfies an awe
XLIII.
   When Richard went to mill;
Yet interdict my blossom
In purposeless circumference,
A heaven in a gaze,
Had notched the place that pleased him, —
Shadows hold their breath;
You have passed enfranchised feet!
   Could give them any pause;
Pink, small, and punctual,
Initial of creation, and
   There is its victory!
Seems it, to my hooded thinking,
Has sated flame's conditions,
As children to the rainbow's scarf,
And yet abide the world!
   At once is mute again.
    Recited fluent here.
VI.
And I 'd like to look a little more
A door just opened on a street —
THE INEVITABLE.
How warm they were on such a day:
       Heedless of the boy
   Portentous inference,
To hang our head ostensibly,
Just felt the world go by!
ALPINE GLOW.
Oh, sacrament of summer days,
A travelling flake of snow
Since the mighty autumn afternoon
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.
I wonder if the sepulchre
For fear their yellow gown
I've heard the hunter tell;
To meet so enabled a man!
   That only childhood knows.
And still the aprons fly,
O'erlooking a superior spectre
I like a look of agony,
She rose to his requirement, dropped
Sufficient troth that we shall rise —
Entirely for me;
And many hurt;
   Then nearer, then so slow
No drearier can prevail!
   And begets her spot.
A little water supplicate
When that which is and that which was
And stir all day to pretty tunes
Pleiad its name, and robin,
The maple's loom is red.
   Just as the dusk was brown,
Inviting to
Just laying off, for evidence,
Of more esteem than ducats.
Early aged, and often cold, —
Still rears the East her amber flag,
Too intrinsic for renown.
THE WIFE.
The spider as an artist
For period exhaled.
God's residence is next to mine,
TRYING TO FORGET.
Some other thirsty there may be
A novel agony,
New fingers stir the sod;
I have no life but this,
And shouts fill all my childish sky,
It slipped and slipped,
To think just how the fire will burn,
And when her breath was done,
In just the dress his century wore;
Which in a perturbation
As for the lost we grapple,
   And bells that boldly ring
By but a simple arrow
The hills just tell the orchards —
Then cloudier become;
The murmuring of bees has ceased;
The busy darling lay,
This merit hath the worst, —
At evening it is not;
When Sappho was a living girl,
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow, —
Supposed that he had come to dwell,
Is numb and vital-less.
Then I had counted it until
   Our only lullaby.
   Than the hand of friend,
Would put out Jesus',
Into the boiling sand.
The thoughtful grave encloses, —
   A night or two ago,
And could not bear to shut until
And kindly ask it in, —
An axe shrill singing in the woods;
These emerald seams enclose.
That bustle so illustrious
His venerable hand to take,
That often as a cloud it met
Wait till the majesty of Death
A MAN.
And peace was Paradise!
That each can make but once,
Deposed, at length, the grave —
The springtime's pallid landscape
As if no soul the solstice passed
I hear the level bee:
   Such as these, are still.
We paused before a house that seemed
'Father, thy will be done' to-day,
Beguiles the centuries of way!
Or the most agonizing spy
   For fear I hear her say
Feather by feather, on the plain
   Do lowlier appear;
Extinguished in its sea.
The pedigree of honey
Born everlasting now.
   In such a little while!
Within its hope, though yet ungrasped
    To purer reveille!
Of which I have never heard?
Have I the art to say.
   To lose it in the sea,
XXIII.
To — no one that you know!
I am poor once more!
Pain has an element of blank;
It's like the light, —
But only on my forehead stopped,
GHOSTS.
One little mind from school, —
I wonder if they bore it long,
     As that exalted here.
The meteor of birds,
Great Spirit, give to me
Which little yellow boys and girls
So I, the undivine abode
   It shall belong to me,
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
If then He hear,
   When I forget to tease,
Leaning against the sun!
When winter shakes the door,
   About my feet the sea.
In bright detachment stand.
   What abstinence is there!
And came my way no more.
I don't know when,
Is there such a thing as day?
Held fast in everlasting race
'T is the majority
Or amulets of pine.
Within my income these could lie,
No furrow on the glow,
   To look her in the face
   Have lain their missiles by.
My country need not change her gown,
Question if his glory
The attar from the rose
Surrendering the last,
        HELEN JACKSON.
Her final summer was it,
The thought behind I strove to join
Surfeit? When the daffodil
Wending late home,
Italicized, as 't were.
   And put it in a drawer, —
The Spirit turns away,
   So distant to alarms, —
SUPERIORITY TO FATE.
   Which are out of sight?
   Will arrive to me!
The one the other will absorb,
None buy it any more.
Or rhododendron worn.
The subtle cargoes lie.
Try! can you stir the awful rivet?
Choose one;
With a revolving wheel;
His observation omnifold,
And a green chill upon the heat
This side the victory!
After playing Crown!
Could but a crier of the glee
Cheerful, as to the village,
"'T is daisy in the shortest;
In a satin vest.
A flash of dew, a bee or two,
A fellow in the skies
Across a barn or through a rut
Enlarging loneliness.
   Till we are called to rise;
Could we stand with that old Moses
Did not ourselves the cubits warp
I taste a liquor never brewed,
Next time, to stay!
   Please God, shall ascertain!
Summer for thee grant I may be
I worked for chaff, and earning wheat
I knew so perfect yesterday, —
The past is such a curious creature,
I touched her cradle mute;
I'm nobody! Who are you?
I could not miss an ear,
And yet the crowd applauds below;
One more "Ye Blessed" to be told;
   The altitude of me?
'T is first I lock the door,
Now, when I read, I read not,
What if the poles should frisk about
When just this time, some perfect year,
   And the brake of dun!
     Of which it died.
   At daybreak overcome!
Till we are stouter;
Without my right of frost,
Retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails
The smitten rock that gushes,
Still states, to dates that have forgot,
And bees to entertain,
   For every day is said
But when it leaves us for a time,
A little this side of the snow
Fate slew him, but he did not drop;
   Of a dependent brood;
Yet strangest, heavier since it went,
Into deep eternity!
The only secret people keep
CALLED BACK.
   I stand alive to-day
But early yet for God;
You left me, sweet, two legacies, —
A different Peru;
Humming the quaintest lullaby
The moon was but a chin of gold
   Upon the slowest night.
If I should disappoint the eyes
Put gently up the evening bars,
   Is Immortality.
II.
While the old couple, just astir,
'T is little I could care for pearls
'T were easier to die
A watch, some ancient brooch
   How nonchalant the wood,
   Between the heaves of storm.
Interrupt this ground.
With such a practised frost,
   To electricity.
Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,
Till the evening, nearing,
If anybody's friend be dead,
Augmented, sweet, a hundred fold
And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.
What necklaces could be!
Who sings the same, unheard,
The morns are meeker than they were,
If, haply, any say to me,
I sing to use the waiting,
   Since none of them are mine.
Captivity is consciousness,
And so, upon this wise I prayed, —
But when the south wind stirs the pools
By faith is overcome.
''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;
If, haply, thro' a dream to peep
This audience of idleness
And come next hour to look.
They'd judge us — how?
   I envy speechless hills
Let down the bars, O Death!
Insulting is the sun
Or flag subsist, or fame export
Earring, or stone,
The housewife's gentle task.
Strangles them.
Bars cannot conceal!
And if to miss were merry,
   Sagacious confidence;
Departing like a pageant
Beneath his tabernacles play,
Was it Goliath was too large,
The grass so little has to do,
That I stopped gauging, satisfied,
So constant to its stolid trust,
That made existence home!
That kept so many warm.
She was mute from transport,
To see who's there.
       Stoops to an easy clover —
The bell within the steeple wild
How luscious lies the pea within
With a suspicious air, —
   Is immaterial.
And they 'll wilt, like men.
Their coming mentioned be.
I wished the grass would hurry,
A portico,
And started for the sun.
   Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,
XXXVIII.
When nothing was to see
   How sleek the woe appears
On winter afternoons,
I read my sentence steadily,
As children caper when they wake,
   Enjoining secrecy, —
I con that thing, — "forgiven," —
As guest who would be gone.
To that new marriage, justified
   Who own the ample sea;
Put out their tongues, for noon.
At window and at door.
Presents upon a tree,
As one should come to town
I laughed a wooden laugh
   Is difficult to learn.
Royalty enough for me
So I must baffle at the hint
It shames the constancy that fled
I tasted wheat, — and hated chaff,
Partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us
When the meadows parching lie,
Motionless as peace.
And rested on a beam;
   Or noons report away,
The last and second time
In your new-fashioned world!
His fantasy to please.
Have you got a brook in your little heart,
A vest that, like the bodice, danced
   That day.
For you served Heaven, you know,
Nor action new,
While the ages steal, —
'T is true the drought is destitute,
Nor definitely what it was,
No squirrel went abroad;
Developed from within, —
I died for beauty, but was scarce
Of the mysterious bard!
Where bashful flowers blow,
As soon as you have come,
The brother of the universe
Are out of sight, in heaven.
I bring thee the imperial heart
They bear no other errand,
The heaven below the heaven above
Dips — evades — teases — deploys;
I felt a clearing in my mind
Were useless as next morning's sun,
And still she plies her spotted brooms,
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,
   And when I sought my bed,
A very few, a bird or two,
   Thy little plan to me,
DEAD.
The birds, in docile rows,
EMANCIPATION.
A robber 'd like the look of, —
   'T were Thanksgiving day.
Or a glee among the garrets,
   Who may expected be?
   How easy all can see
A murmur in the trees to note,
Of tassels and of coaches soon;
Cannot excel decay;
Her pretty parasol was seen
I felt siroccos crawl, —
MY ROSE.
To his adroit Creator
By this great light upon our minds
To lose one's faith surpasses
How out of breath you are!
JOY IN DEATH.
Did the paradise, persuaded,
Not with a club the heart is broken,
THE LOST THOUGHT.
A Heavenly Father would content,
To us, the duller scholars
And make much blunder, if at last
Nor any coursers like a page
Enhances nature now.
Besides the autumn poets sing,
That blame is just as dear as praise
It tried to be a rose
An awe came on the trinket!
I know some lonely houses off the road
Who robbed the woods,
The heart asks pleasure first,
I've known her from an ample nation
   I will contented be;
It founds the homes and decks the days,
The bosoms where the frost has lain
No dew upon the grass,
Her unanointed forehead
   To universe, or me,
Her forehead is of amplest blond;
   As lately as to-day.
You must have walked —
Might I but be the Jew!
   Had almost made it dear.
No man drew.
To Eden wandered in —
I should have been too glad, I see,
Death is but one and comes but once,
   The grave preceded me,
       Then to the royal clouds
And life was not so ample I
   He feeds upon the fair;
Death's privilege?
The soul selects her own society,
At centre of the sea,
What inn is this
What mystery pervades a well!
Lest I should be old-fashioned,
That travellers had thrown,
Full royal is his retinue,
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.
Mirth is the mail of anguish,
ENDING.
My holiday shall be
I offered him a crumb,
Was savory.
Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand,
High from the earth I heard a bird;
My prayer away I threw;
This world is not conclusion;
But did not finish, — some way back,
   Where, keeping house for thee,
THE RETURN.
VOID.
    Its quivering substance plays
Assent, and you are sane;
Tell him just how the fingers hurried,
When you have done, pray tell me,
They 'd banish us, you know.
   To sleep its shape away, —
The robin is the one
From some old fortress on the sun
   To tenderer renown.
XXXVII.
An ecstasy in chief;
That ravished all the hill;
Far safer through an Abbey gallop,
She recognized the foot,
   Between the light and me;
Her voice among the aisles
The grave it was, reposed upon
By just such a hazard
To look upon her like, alive,
The news like squirrels ran.
Upon a toilsome way
   Remains to him unknown:
For such a noticing.
She laid her docile crescent down,
XXII.
Were challenging despair.
He 'd be too tall, the tallest one
To shut the other's gaze down, —
Then bubbled slow away.
I think just how my lips will weigh
It was not night, for all the bells
Think of it, lover! I and thee
It wears a sprig upon its breast,
Our life, his porcelain,
From out my summer's eve;
   How different we are!
But they could gag the tick,
An overcoat of clay.
On whom the summer shone!
   Glimmer on the spot!
Their chivalry consumes,
And instead of tolling the bell for church,
   It made us all ashamed
He danced along the dingy days,
Life, and Death, and Giants
Lift, if you can, the listless hair;
One blessing had I, than the rest
What if I file this mortal off,
And I, for wonder at his woe,
But internal difference
Before the world is green
   How could I break my word?
Better than larger values,
   For beggar, or for cat.
And exigencies never fears;
I never lost as much but twice,
Was it the mat winked,
Somehow, it will be even,
Departed to the judgment,
Meet tranquilly as friends,
   Some call experience.
Must tell!
Obedient to her eye,
Knowest thou the shore
A flower expected everywhere;
This gave me that precarious gait
We gave no other bond.
But just a crumb to me;
But not again that dew was seen
In the fair schoolroom of the sky.
Fell, they will say, in 'skirmish'!
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?
Will the frock I wept in
Some things that fly there be, —
His fashions quaint, mosaic,
MEMORIALS.
Beguiling thus the wonder,
   It blistered in my dream;
It has no future but itself,
And whistled in the air,
But did because they died, — a fact
The eyes glaze once, and that is death.
As lady from her door
You, unsuspecting, wear me too —
Reeling, through endless summer days,
That they pronounce my name.
BECLOUDED.
With just the door ajar
The "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death, by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without important exception, her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse.
Than when the winter came,
How many times these low feet staggered,
How still the riddle lies!
The unsuspecting trees
   Unto the nearest town?
Wait till in everlasting robes
   Like an adversity.
I'm going all along!
   They struggle some for breath,
Passed out of record
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
NUMEN LUMEN.
Whose sandals touch the town, —
The most unworthy flower.
   Not loud enough for wind;
   Corn is made at noon,
Than save my boot,
That deaden suffering;
And then adjusted his little notes,
We passed the setting sun.
Her golden finger on her lip,
Staid sleeping there.
I dare not eat it, though I starve, —
Or first prospective, or the gold
So safer, guess, with just my soul
But never met this fellow,
VII.
You dropped an amber thread;
A something in a summer's noon, —
Henceforth her only one.
And the bridges often go.
But Death had told her so the first,
Of mountain and of plain, —
The symbol of a word
I moved my fingers off
I had a star in heaven;
Spending scarlet like a woman,
One hand the tools,
When we are going home.
Quick! a sharper rustling!
I ceded all of dust I knew, —
Where he is floorless, yet of fear
   Poor little heart!
    Yellow she affords
And kiss the hills for me, just once;
And morn a new politeness took,
Until to-morrow, — happy letter!
   When nature's laugh is done, —
And still the punctual snow!
   Can pierce an armed man.
I know the butterfly;
Until they lock it in the grave,
Supports me like imperial drams
Scantily dealt to the summer morning,
COCOON.
POWER.
And then, that we have followed them
Yet take her from the lawn,
Had he the power to spurn!
The one the other will include
For ampler coveting.
Before they drop full music on;
AURORA.
And life and I keep even.
Nor had I time to love; but since
What if I burst the fleshly gate
I had been hungry all the years;
The leaves, like women, interchange
Death is a dialogue between
Like intermittent plush were heard
I'd rather call him star!
   A cycle, it may be,
The sun just touched the morning;
And then, if it should be
Like that old measure in the boughs,
Taken from men this morning,
A spotted shaft is seen;
Two worlds, like audiences, disperse
Lost doubly, but by contrast most,
   Ashore at last!
The realm of you.
Unties her yellow bonnet
   Nor near enough to find;
To note the fashions of the cross,
Who cannot thank them, for the ice
The reefs in old Gethsemane
   And tumbles in the sea.
With her extremity,
   Wrecked, solitary, here.
Did try to chalk the sun
But if there were a Jason,
Superiority to fate
My lifetime folding up
When April woods are red."
It never did betray
There, — gathered from the gales,
REMORSE.
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
A paradise, the host,
I looked for you before.
That was all!
The neighbors rustle in and out,
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;
As sure as flocks go home at night
   A worm his utmost goal.
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
And then, if we are true to plan,
   For the upper air!
It was a common night,
And struggle slacker, but to prove,
Than an interior confronting
Exhibiting to these.
Though all the rest are here, —
   As if my trade were bone.
Can't put the puppet bowing
Runs evenly and true;
The fashion of the ear
Where it used to be.
What sorcery had snow?
Which solemnizes me.
And deem ourself a fool.
It wrinkled, and was gone.
   That just now dangled still.
Prove piercing earnest,
That toddled down the bay!
His feet are shod with gauze,
Never such an ambuscade
Obtrude no more.
The deer invites no longer
Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
As hopelessly as I,
Of indigo and brown.
'T is lost, and lost to me.
   That scalps your naked soul.
I shall forget the drop of anguish
Who is the landlord?
Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
Paid all that life had earned
And the children no further question,
Into Van Diemen's land.
I years had been from home,
Till my small library.
REAL RICHES.
Too late for striving fingers
Without the fear to justify, —
   No station in the day?
We play at paste,
The morning foreign shone, —
One clover, and a bee,
He glanced with rapid eyes
And "station" and the rest!
Be its pillow round;
It quivered through the grass,
And rowed him softer home
Putting up
Than an earl's distinguished face;
The stray ships passing spied a face
   It almost speaks to me.
The mermaids in the basement
The lady just unrolled.
How softly sinks his trembling sun
It burned me in the night,
Or what the distant say
And shiver for the poor,
   Chime noon.
What will the fir-tree say?
A timid thing to drop a life
   Upon a sea of blond;
But why compare?
   Residing in a jar.
And yet, inspected closely,
At least, it solaces to know
Sweet hours have perished here;
One little maid from playmates,
Past sunrise! Ah! what leagues there are
Of cordiality;
A piercing comfort it affords
While he, victorious, tilts away
Eternity enables the endeavoring
But epoch had no basis here,
MINE.
Look back on time with kindly eyes,
The siren Alps,
One little boat gave up its strife,
All overgrown by cunning moss,
It spun and spun,
But this time consciously, of grace
That there exists a gold,
Breaks up my feet,
THE BEE.
To go without the spectre's aid
If recollecting were forgetting,
You cannot fold a flood
Safe in their alabaster chambers,
Before the door of God!
And frigates in the upper floor
While color's revelations break,
   And blaze the butterflies!
For transport it be sure.
Of bronze and blaze
Will entertain the centuries
Then quivered out of decimals
A quietness distilled,
There's something quieter than sleep
This sums the apparatus
Of the separated people
It might have been the lighthouse spark
When they take the knife!
The flying tidings whirled.
   One Pleiad was its name,
I turn my brimming eyes away,
The martyrs even trod,
CHILDISH GRIEFS.
So busy was she, finishing,
It would be life,
   He is new and high;
Induces my belief,
When time's brief masquerade was done,
That we've immortal place,
Except to some wide-wandering bee,
Some lose their way.
The bodiless begun;
A route of evanescence

Then they will hasten to the door
   That some are like my own.
And angels know the rest.
"Perhaps they did not hear," I said;
And place was where the presence was,
One might depart at option
   Correctly, yet to me
And then together bore away
   Bulb after bulb, in silver rolled,
   And if they have to try,
IN SHADOW.
   And let the fire through.
Any forgot by victory
He pays no rent, —
Our panting ankle barely gained
And windows hanging low,
To those in heaven now.
New feet within my garden go,
They may take the trifle
The bone that has no marrow;
   How many I espy
Whether she met with gales,
   There interposed a fly,
And swung their frenzied hair.
   I speculate no more.
Oh sea, look graciously!
Such dimity convictions,
I hope the father in the skies
Since I hoped I dared;
'T was sunset all the day.
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,

And then the milliner, and the man

This is the sovereign anguish,

RENUNCIATION.
   I have a missing friend, —
And bells keep saying 'victory'

That's all.

THE SHELTER.
After dinner light for flowers,
And lo! her silver principle
by EMILY DICKINSON
As blind men learn the sun;
II. LOVE.
Next time, the things to see
And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates
Parting is all we know of heaven,
Disdaining men and oxygen,
I wondered which would miss me least,
But children on the Don
   The stillness round my form
Was never blown away.
I left the place with all my might, —
   I hear the silver strife;
No treason it can fear;
Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane;
The palm without the Calvary;
Would split, for size of me.
But then,
Upon the mortal side.
Nor rend with scymitar.

New weary sleep below;
Somewhere, in silence.
Ah, what sagacity perished here!
She turns as long away
MELODIES UNHEARD.
Felt feebly for her crown, —
Where the place called morning lies!
I have so much to tell!
I missed mine. How dreary marbles,
They 're here, though; not a creature failed,
ETERNITY.
Lost, in the sepulchre.
Morn is supposed to be,
And hands beseeching thrown.
And rumbles still, though torrid noons
The field a scarlet gown.
Whose wandering is done.
They storm the earth and stun the air,
   It be not tragedy!
It makes no difference abroad,
Till summer folds her miracle
Can such a foot explore
But large enough for me.
To subdue the bumble-bee!
Such as content, and heaven;
Learned gem-tactics
Whose pencil, here and there,
I hide myself within my flower,
In amber lies;
It can't be dying, — it's too rouge, —
Peace, by its battles told;
The thunder hurried slow;
Laying her spotted face, to die;
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
While I was gone, and I — too late —
Without a tighter breathing,
The lower metres of the year,
My feet, too, that had wandered so,
Have I the lip of the flamingo
To dare.
With ropes of sand
These are the patient laureates
    Doubtful if it be crowned!
   And never I mind the sea;
To lives that thought their worshipping
Her little figure at the gate
   His never slumbering plan;
Stranded, through discipline,
Be sure you count, should I forget, —
The gown that Dante deified.
   A woman white to be,
"Whose are the little beds," I asked,
   Whom none but daisies know.
"And I for truth, — the two are one;
And now you 've littered all the East
Merry that it is morn,
It 's far, far treasure to surmise,
GONE.
The heaven unexpected came,
Creation looking on.
For the departed creature's sake
Related somehow they may be, —
Until it settled firm on Paradise.
And yet we knew that gentle clock
The mushroom is the elf of plants,
But since the last included both,
   Of vanished dames and men!
And scooped a turnpike for themselves,
You, too, take cobweb attitudes
   Could not obtain for me.

Except thyself may be
And dip your fingers in the frost:
Run round and round a room
That bore another rose;
Upon his dateless fame
And if I gain, — oh, gun at sea,
And he — he followed close behind;
   When what we need is by,
   The sedge stands next the sea,
And I and silence some strange race,
To lips long parching, next to mine,
Behind this mortal bone
We are the flower, Thou the sun!
Then, bending from the sky
Mine enemy is growing old, —
PROBLEMS.
   Nods from the seconds slim,
For it would split his heart to know it,
Almost a loneliness.
Remembrance has a rear and front, —
I bring an unaccustomed wine
Are friends delight or pain?
And summon them to drink.
When that old imperator, Death,
Rise solemn in the tree,
The forests galloped till they fell,
Time brought me other robins, —
They 're centuries from that.
Though his surpassing merit
RETURNING.
Nor any death, but lest
You'll know it by the row of stars
But Calvary.
THE RAT.
   Remember, as thou flee,
   'T is a necessity.
MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON
   We jest and shut the door;
The aptitude to fly,
Before the ice is in the pools,
It's past set down before the soul,
Sounds long, until I read the place
For mine, I tell you that my heart
The living looked that day.
And do the little toils
A pittance at a time,
Or brooches, when the Emperor
To have it intermit;
If I could see you in a year,
"That must have been the sun!"
Still chafes its narrow bed;
For his decamping wants.
No color in the rainbow
Read, sweet, how others strove,
Love, by memorial mould;
I never saw before
New children play upon the green,
The soul unto itself
Is all the rest I knew!
When bumble-bees in solemn flight
Or whether it be none,
Futile the winds
Here a star, and there a star,
TOO LATE.
The cattle fled to barns;
Because estates can be
And then, to go to sleep;
Therefore, as one returned, I feel,
Her household, her assembly;
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,
And then an awful leisure was,
Some keep the Sabbath going to church;
Admonished by her buckled lips
I've seen a dying eye
After a hundred years
When it began, or if there were
He bit an angle-worm in halves
So I get home, 't will compensate.
If you would like to borrow
A monster with a glass
There is its noiseless onset,
No daybreak can bestir;
Was dressed in mechlin, — so;
    The debauchee of dews!
   And makes one lift one's hat,
Present them here!
Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing
Now know I they both visited
   Upon a plane of gauze!
LONGING.
How pleased they were at what you said;
Winds of summer fields
Put me in on the firmest side,
'Mong such unique
Minor apparatus, hopper of the mill,
   We were content to show,
   That from you or me
A quality of loss
   Have summer's leave to be,
Unto his nest again,
Was all the one that fell.
We must an anguish pay
If I should bribe the little bird,
When heaven looked upon us all
Great Britain disapproves "the stars;"
From a superior bush.
   A service like a drum
       The heaven we chase
Is shorter than a snake's delay,
Attended or alone,
Doth like a bubble antedate,
   In just a country town.
DESIRE.
The murmur of a bee
That hunger was a way
For shops would stare, that I,

The leaves unhooked themselves from trees
By homely anguish strung.

He hurts a little, though.
You will know I'm trying
With no police to follow,
More near.
Took up her simple wardrobe
Clear strains of hymn
Or would they go on aching still
Whose coat of elemental brown
Undue significance a starving man attaches
It makes the parting tranquil
Crumbs fit such little mouths,
Report was not to me.
'T was such an ample peace,
   Some disease had vexed;
And trudging feet from school.
Where ships of purple gently toss
Around a pile of mountains,
The north begun to push,
   Upon a sacrament.
Or shroud of gnome,
   When frosts too sharp became,
'T was so unlike the crumb
Enabled by his royal dress,
For whom betrayed the dell,
She mentioned, and forgot;
I wish I knew that woman's name,
The shapes, though, were similar,
Morning has not occurred!
A honey bears away
Mine by the royal seal!

If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee and executor. Surely after you are what is called "dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think we have a right to withhold from the world a word or a thought any more than a deed which might help a single soul. . . .
A blue and gold mistake.
SUSPENSE.
But then I am a rural man,
A little road not made of man,
Then stills its artisans like ghosts,
Agony, that enacted there,
I felt his silver heel
   Till mine too heavy grew,
My paradise, the fame
Not like the dew did she return
A wider sunrise in the dawn;
   Is helped by the regret
Am sovereign of them all.
When we with daisies lie,
   The doctor drives away.
The Caspian has its realms of sand,
By every broom and Bridget
   A horror so refined
Jehovah's countenance!

If I can stop one heart from breaking,
Then veil my too inspecting face,
But if he ask where you are hid
Past bows and invitations,
Put down your hat —
And signed the fete away.
And shouts for joy to nobody
And then we knelt in prayer.
That brooks in meadows run;
OUT OF THE MORNING.
Might I but moor
As imperceptibly as grief
Associates or glows alone,
The banquet of abstemiousness
But I shall never tell!
And glance securely round.
   No evidence gives he.
And on the other side
I waked, to find it first awake,
God calls home the angels promptly
   And Being's beggary.
And that side of the haze.
He questioned softly why I failed?
   The loss of an estate,
For visitor, or sundown;
That I shall love alway,
VANISHED.
Upon the closet shelves.
Of tribulation these are they

A charm invests a face
Old Nicodemus' phantom
When I shall be forgiven,
Except to heaven, she is nought;
Its distance to behold!
   I may remember him!
Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!
The rat is the concisest tenant.
For you know we do not mind our dress
   The interdicted ground
Oh, find it, sir, for me!
Of a delivered syllable,
Keeps pleading, "I don't know."
As other creatures that have eyes,

In the silent west
   Or a disgrace.
And mockery was still.
Not any voice denotes it here,
' T is the seal, despair, —
Should have the face to die.
The silence like an ocean rolled,
    Night's possibility!
We outgrow love like other things
O'ertook by blast,
    And say how many dew;
The motions of the dipping birds,
   Unto her sacrament.
FAREWELL.
"The sleet than May — no thee!"
   For, lift them, pound for pound,
The clouds, like listless elephants,
As ever in the sky.
I hope I 'm ready for the worst,
   That on her lisping piled.
   Upon her puzzled ear;
We barred the windows and the doors
Stealth's slow;
The grave my little cottage is,
And if, indeed, I fail,
With water, in the country church,
The clouds their backs together laid,
Besides, the deepest cellar
   And breaths were gathering sure
And then, reluctant, turn away
Have crawled too far?
And time should gurgle on,
The river could not drown;
Show them this meek apparelled thing,
Just lost when I was saved!
Conform my soul as 't were a church
If it contain a kernel?
Felicity or doom.
Give Himmaleh, —
PARTING.
The hand that paused to gather
"No, sir! In thee!"
   Of what astute abode,
As a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial," "A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named by their author, frequently at the end,—sometimes only in the accompanying note, if sent to a friend.
In ceaseless rosemary.
A pair of spectacles ajar just stir —
Many will doubtless ask me,
Except the dying; this to us
Enlarged beyond my utmost scope,
Triumph may be of several kinds.
To wonder what myself will say,
That like the drunkard goes;
I live with him, I hear his voice,
Whose bleating ceases to repeat,
Of all the sounds despatched abroad,
Then, punctual as a star,
Remorse is memory awake,
Whether to isles enchanted
   Birds, by the snow.
When but a little child, —
The blissful oriole.
Adown the empty street.
The soul should stand in awe.
Upon her friend she could bestow
Mixing fresher air.
For certainly her way might pass
My friend must be a bird,
The Jesuit of orchards,
To witness to the certainty
The stars about my head I felt,
But I tug childish at my bars, —
   For, hold them, blue to blue,
Imperfectly beheld, —
Unto my seeming make?
Upon her mat.
When, duller than our dulness,
Riches were good.
No blossom stayed away
   Were such her silver will!
But microscopes are prudent
Too silver for a seam,
'T is drama, if (hypothesis)
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!
A "this way" beckons spaciously, —
   Bloom I strove to raise.
Of victors designate.
I. LIFE.
Than it eludes the hound.
No hue of afternoon
Enlightened to a larger pain
To keep it from effacing
   On the other side, —
The whole of me, forever,
   To fail with land in sight,
Inviolable compact
That I have had before,
   Quietly did the same,
   There'll be that dark parade
Contented, known, before
My nosegays are for captives;
A hurry in the breath,
My neighbor be.
Look too expensive?
When suddenly across the June
Why floods are served to us in bowls, —
   And thanked the ample friend;
I know a place where summer strives
   How trivial is life!'
Advances calm to her supreme,
Reckon the morning's flagons up,
A rapid, footless guest,
   But possible to earn
   Their ballads were the same, —
Each was to each the sealed church,
Can the sailor understand
Is the eclat of death.
   And it's partly down hill.
The morning after death
The sounds of welcome near!
A passing universe put on;
I just wear my wings,
   With tints of majesty,
   Till, swollen with the sky,
   Fructified in sand.
I never can decide;
   To take the pumpkins in.

And this untoward transport
Their velvet masonry
And sweetest in the gale is heard;

I lived on dread; to those who know

The figure of a nut
Though drifted deep in parian
Great clouds like ushers leaning,
     Because it dies!

And covered up our names.

Wooden barred,
The shutting of the eye.

NOVEMBER.
With infinite affection
Was recently among us.
   Puts minor streams to rest.
His is the halcyon table
Or is entombed so still
Next to the robin
Ah, brig, good-night
   And wealth, and company.
He bolts the door,
And blue, beloved air —
That syllable whose faith
And took himself for pay.
   Would be a daily thing,
In that immortal copy
Please God, might I behold him
A kingdom's title-deed, —
In murmuring platoon!
   Posterior to death,
Had broken rank,
Before you thought of spring,
The low grass loaded with the dew,
My garner shows so fair.
To her fair repose.
   That one, to be quite sure
We waited while she passed;
Till with long fright and longer trust
Me! Come! My dazzled face
Bold little beauty,
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Not a mention, whose small pebble
Eternity by term.
Wear nothing commoner than snow,
   That makes no show for dawn
Will no one guide a little boat
Came out to look at me,

When simple you and I
   We journey to the day,
A SERVICE OF SONG.
And if he spoke, what name was best,
   In frantic melody!
       Ah! the bee flies not
Impatient of no child,
   Beside your twinkling door.
And you should live,
How they will tell the shipwreck
Unto the shepherd's arm!
When, were the gales propitious,
He has hid his rare life
   Comes up to face the skies,
SATISFIED.
THE SEA OF SUNSET.
But turning back 't was slow.
THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.
It paints my simple spirit
To have a smile for mine each day,
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,
Sweet morning, when I over-sleep,
She leads him, docile as a boy,
   Powerless to unfold.
   Nature had left behind.
   She felled — he did not fall —
A dim capacity for wings
What more the woman can, —
To countenances new!
But nature is a stranger yet;
   That if the heaven inquire,
I first surmised the horses' heads
Without a color but the light
Haunted by native lands, the while,
DEATH AND LIFE.
And this brief tragedy of flesh
So nearly infinite.
Oft a head is crested
I shall not live in vain.
Though never yet, in any port,
And visions vast and small.
   Where was once a room,
Acquaintance, just a few,
So proud she was to die
Had nature any outcast face,
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
'T is then we sigh for houses,
How sweet it would have tasted,
   Geneva's farthest skill
And I have ceased to wonder why;
   For fear to be a king.
Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and the "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,—appealing, indeed, to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.
A privilege of hurricane
And ruddier than the gown
Old ones crack.

He lived where dreams were sown.

At half-past seven, element
With eyes in death still begging raised,
So satisfied to go
Water is taught by thirst;

On stump and stack and stem, —
And then a quarry pare
I had a guinea golden;
The time was scarce profaned by speech;
The heroism we recite
As much of noon as I could take
A dominie in gray
A floor too cool for corn.
Dear March, how are you?
That self were hell to me.
However true their show;
But that negotiation
Far as the east from even,
Or some elf's catacomb?
   All other hearts I knew.
On seas of daffodil,
Had it remained to speak.
My business, — just a life I left,
Round her chamber hums,
   Before the skaters go,
And thrum upon the door,
   To houses unperceived, —
In its extremest clause, —
The royal scar hast thou?
I fitted to the latch
And could not breathe without a key;
After a life, a death we'll say, —
Adrift! A little boat adrift!

The morning stars the treble led
   It is just as well!
   Replenished, — faith cannot.
Delayed till she had ceased to know,
How a small dusk crawls on the village
Unscrutinized by eye.
Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,
And debauchee of dew,
Like children round a sire:
Thy windy will to bear!

Lawful as
Busy needles, and spools of thread,
   For many an ardent year.

LOYALTY.
The sun went out to work,
From us she wandered now a year,
Till weights will hang.
   Exultant, onward sped!
My heart would wish it broke before,
We trust that she was willing, —
Or stirring house below,
How still the bells in steeples stand,
The sun proceeds unmoved
You try to touch the smile,
FRINGED GENTIAN.
   Perceives when you are gone.
   And will not tell its name.
To any happy flower,
   Did they forsake thee?
   So stately they ascend
   To him whose mortal light,
   Within a hut of stone
   He, too, did fly away.
And 't was like midnight, some,
   Salubrious hours are given,
And then the streets stood still.
Thy music still when whippoorwill
No person testified.
The cornice but a mound.
Read then of faith
Belted down with emerald;
The wind begun to rock the grass
To some superior tree
The seasons prayed around his knees,
   To that abhorred abode
THE MUSHROOM.
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;
My noon had come, to dine;
At rest his fingers are.
When night is almost done,
The hands still hug the tardy glass;

For chanticleer to wake it, —

Brave names of men

For my will goes the other way,
APRIL.
Is it brought from famous countries
   Although I heard them try!
And lick the valleys up,
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended —
Just girt me for the onset with eternity,
Know what the sapphire fellows do,
Till hair and eyes and timid head
Know how to starve!
How odd the girl's life looks
And then a livid claw.
I know that he exists
And deal occasional smiles
ROUGE GAGNE.
The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue,
And on the strangest sea;
   When sacrament is done.
What they renounced,
The heaven the creeds bestow.
Near kinsman to herself,
I could not bear the bees should come,
Late, my acre of a rock
I could not find a privacy
Thine the securest fold;
Without disclosing what it be,
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.
Its unobtrusive mass.
I took my power in my hand.
The hours slid fast, as hours will,
So helpless when I turned
The purple could not keep the east,
I'll fetch thee brooks
For the contented beggar's face
Than that, be sweeter wise;
The stones achase,
Unmeaning now, to me,
Success is counted sweetest
Before the seal!
Morning is the place for dew,
   Struck no one but myself,
   Or brushed a royal gown;
Tears open her imperial veins
To look at her; how slowly
Because I know it 's true;
And softly pick its lock.
That overflows the noon
I could not fix the year,
"'T is iris, sir, and aster,
And made the gables laugh.
Earn her own surprise!
Oh, last communion in the haze,
Essential oils are wrung:
An instant's width of warmth disclosed,
A goal,
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?
And then, prodigious, step
   Is tarnished by the snow,
This, dost thou doubt, sweet?
Indicative that suns go down;
   But murmuring of some
Anemone and bell,
The orchards spangles hung.
That speechless from her nest
   And night is coming down!
Grave saints stole out to look at me,
Yet to my irritated ear
Thou stirrest earthquake in the South,
Lay this laurel on the one
And then I go the furthest off
   Of the appalling trade,
A dew sufficed itself
As children bid the guest good-night,
   Eternally unknown.
    Her loving bosom lay.
   As nature's curtain fell
Set orderly, for burial,
Where you were not,
The wrinkles of the road.
Our luxury!
     Then to tell.
   Of our immortal mind,
Make this bed with awe;
Or any cheek at nightfall
   I think it that "new life!"
Convulsion playing round,
I'm Czar, I'm woman now:
LOVE'S BAPTISM.
For entertaining plated wares
THANKSGIVING DAY.
The conscience of us all
Instinct picking up the key
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,

Can go, itself, without a fan
Frequently are brown;
And then it knocks at will.

Scarlet experiment! sceptic Thomas,
Unbroken forehead from the east
Down which on either hand

I should not fear the foe then,
   At what is dread to me.
The name they dropped upon my face
   Or chase me if I do,
For interview had come;
   Of all the martial blest.
   A fisherman's degree!
And estimate the pearl
I felt a funeral in my brain,
   Titian never told;
Who knows?
       Lest it fall,
To lash the magic creature
What ailed so smart a little maid
   And violets are done,
Elysium is as far as to
Doth not retract a single spice
Defeat whets victory, they say;
You left me boundaries of pain
Nature was in her beryl apron,
   Need the wiser tell?
And felt, 'how vast a destiny!
That could not stop to be a king,
Their ribbons just beyond the eye,
I 'm sure 't is India all day
THE MASTER.
I reason, we could die:
The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, —
This latest leisure equal lulls
We have understood, for better
The only ghost I ever saw
Who danger and the dead had faced,
Who are these below?
Was like the stillness in the air
And bowed and sang again.
I am glad they did believe it
For interrupting tears
That on the acre lies.
Inspiriting habiliments
No ornament but palms.
    Like petals from a rose,
Yet not in all the nests I meet
And when his golden walk is done,
With chrysoprase, inlaid.
Some say it is the spheres at play!
THE ROBIN.
The lingering and the stain, I mean —
   And our departure take
As if the chart were given.
   Answer me to wear?
Of orchis in the pasture,
They leap upon their silver feet
Called to my full, the crescent dropped,
With just a clock, —
That perches in the soul,
That I might have the sky
And bore her, struggling, blushing,
But only to himself is known
If Immortality unveil
Or only I too small?
"But, madam, is there nothing else
   It wandered from the same.
Many sails at rest,
   Thou notice us no more,
A SNAKE.
That other kind was pain;
His labor is a chant,
Death doubts it, argues from the ground.
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
The bells at distance called;
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
   Riches are sad.
How dare the robins sing,
   That our minds are hot.
Frequently the hills undress
   Myself his noon could bring,
To seem like perfidy.
COBWEBS.
So keep your secret, Father!
TOO MUCH.
Without design, that I could trace,
   By summer's gracious mien.
Counts his nectars — enters,
I willed my keepsakes, signed away
Some drifts were moved away
The intuition of the news
As the fainting bee,
   Death's single privacy,
   I heard it hit the ground,
When breath blew back,
I mind me that of anguish sent,
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.
Remorse is cureless, — the disease
Or Nature, spending with herself
Those who read the same edition
Until the morning sun,
   Than I reviled myself
Are nothing to the bee;
The sun, as common, went abroad,
His face all victory,
Upon the apple-tree.
The day came slow, till five o'clock,
Victory comes late,
Than be Duke of Exeter
Incautious of the sun.
Where we, with late, celestial face,
    Faith faints to understand.
And sings the tune without the words,
He never heard that fleshless chant
   How cool the bellows feels!
Not even God can heal;
   Upon a raft of air,
Retrospection is prospect's half,
We follow thee until
To bask the centuries away
Proportioned to his several dearth
Unborn, except they had beheld,
I could not hope to own.
   Saved for your ear when lutes be old.
A courteous, yet harrowing grace,
   The nearer her they get.
Then there 's a pair of us — don't tell!
To guess it puzzles scholars;
That makes the quick of woe!
There 's triumph of the finer mind
On the look of death.
Surgeons must be very careful
And touch the pantomime himself.
Might he know
   That the acorn there
   Was nearer than the sky,
   Rapid! That will do!
When, night descending, dumb and dark,
But then I promised ne'er to tell;
The nuts are getting brown;
I crave him grace, of summer boughs,
Is solemnest of industries
    Like a lover's words.
I say, as if this little flower
I thought if I could only live
   From steeples in my soul!
It asked a crumb of me.
   In strong society.
   Is freely certified
Henceforth a dedicated sort,
Morns like these we parted;
If wilderness prevent her feet,
If you should get there first,
When one turned smiling to the land.
Or what Circassian land?
To help our bleaker parts
    Who spun the breadths of blue!
Withstands until the sweet assault
Leap, plashless, as they swim.
FROM THE CHRYSALIS.
INDIAN SUMMER.
The best vitality
First page of Renunciation Second page of Renunciation Third page of Renunciation Fourth page of Renunciation
Who knows but this surrendered face
The birds rose smiling in their nests,
For that last onset, when the king
This timid life of evidence
Prayer is the little implement
   That were the little load;
To let a beetle pass.
Glee! The great storm is over!
   As heaven, unto me!
Equally plausibly;
Going to heaven! —
But differed in returning;
I've got an arrow here;
Had power to mangle me.
At that enthralling gallop
   Now, do you doubt that your bird was true?
Bells, also, in the village,
What right had fields to arbitrate
Gathered from many wanderings,
And he, unmoved, regarded her,
As he esteemed them trifles,
And life would be all spring.
It 's early yet for spring;
There came one drop of giant rain,
Then I said softly to myself,
What dignified attendants,
Can I expound the skies?
   Sped by an archer's bow.
Or even a report of land
'T is starving makes it fat.
My hand, with trembling care,
As far as cannon dwell,
THE SOUL'S STORM.
For mine to look at when I liked, —
Entreat us tenderly
So's liberty.
A transport may reward us,
"Who's there?"
Thy sacred emblems to partake,
Wills silence everywhere.
I wonder how the rich may feel, —
And yet by trades the size of these
   There was no malady.
She dropt as softly as a star
I, trembling, drew the table near,
With a bobolink for a chorister,
Grand go the years in the crescent above them;
When Death lit all the shortness up,
Courtiers quaint, in kingdoms,
Stirs the culprit, — Life!
Meanwhile, her wheeling king
Nature rarer uses yellow
Material place.
THE HEMLOCK.
A lady red upon the hill
LIV.
The spangled gowns, a lesser rank
Through what transporting anguish
Could finish enmity.
With her cherubic quantity,
Would not the jest
Fluttering first, then firmer,
   And all the night ashine,
What if I say I shall not wait?
Except for angels, lone;
XXX.
Far feet of failing men,
He likes a boggy acre,
Neither decree
   It shows the furthest tree
And Judgment twinkled, too,
The lilacs, bending many a year,
   May seize upon his mind,
At the full dew,
To their temerity.
Obedient to the least command
His breast, a single onyx
Only the chemist can disclose
And if I do, when morning comes,
Give the one in red cravat
My best was gone to sleep,
Too happy in my sparrow chance
Nothing to show
    Among astonished boughs;
Gone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,
LVIII.
His character a tonic,
Mine, here in vision and in veto!
I looked in windows, for the wealth
Alas! how heedless were the eyes
And then I come away.
Put on her carmine suit, —
With banquetings to be,
    I 'm not a party to.
And Dnieper wrestlers run.
To feel if blinds be fast,
Our blank in bliss to fill,
XLI.
Dare you see a soul at the white heat?
And just a bit of "crown;"
   A mob of solid bliss.
Pigmy seraphs gone astray,
GOING.
Ah, curious friend,
POSSESSION.
Of all the souls that stand create
And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
When it comes, the landscape listens,
I might have chanced that way!
I have another trust."
Hint that within the riddle

Lest interview annul a want
And later, in August it may be,
Or a nervous star?
If I were as tall as they?
A brief, but patient illness,
OLD-FASHIONED.
And infiniter care,
I could not see it now.
Who charge within the bosom,
So short way off it seems; and now,
A heaven of heavens, the privilege
And wrecks in peace a purple tar,
Lest back the awful door should spring,
Mortal my friend must be,
LVI.
Nature forswears
By stretch of limb or stir of lid, —
Musicians wrestle everywhere:
   To memory and me.
   Beneath the sun may find.
Is not so ample as the breast
   Everything in life.
And flirt all day with buttercups,
When, stooping to secure it,
And the odd flambeaux no men carry
The birds jocoser sung;
The gem was gone;
I wonder if it hurts to live,
Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
But not the obligation
   A crash without a sound;
To tell him it is noon abroad, —
But angels say, on yesterday,
Beneath the village door,
Farther in summer than the birds,
The cherubim withdrew;
Withheld the little child!
Than gain my blue peninsula
A resonance of emerald,
And rivers where the houses ran
The maimed may pause and breathe,
As it has usual done;
Nor constellation burn,
Take me!
Whole pools of it, —
LIII.
   How near I had forgot!
Next time, to tarry,
The breezes brought dejected lutes,
Because you saturated sight,
And I had no more eyes
   We ignorant must be.
A black, as of a spectre's cloak,
Prepares your brittle substance
And left the verb and the pronoun out.
Look, how I clutch it,
   Belief but once can be;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
Not an acre or a caption
But this, in lady's drawer,
With my granite lip!
    Endear the shore beyond.
MAY-FLOWER.
The forest of the dead.
   'T would crumble with the weight.
Had He the offer of;
And if my stocking hung too high,
So shy, so very ignorant,
A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is
Be the perfect one.
The color on the cruising cloud,
To die of thirst, suspecting
   'T is something like a house;
       Invites the race;
I started early, took my dog,
Who marshalled her away.
The wind does, working like a hand
   Be it but a play,
The moon is distant from the sea,
Kept treading, treading, till it seemed
Look to it, by its fathoms
Makes summer when the lady lies
Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison
This traverse may the poorest take
Before my simple bosom broke, —
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,
   This is a mighty room;
Nods from the gilded pointers,
I did not know the ample bread,
As were they old acquaintances, —
Or too impetuous bird.
THE PREACHER.
   And I'm a rose!
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
How conscious consciousness could grow,
   As near yourself to-day
   Just saves it from despair,
Could I see it from the mountains
'T was not thy wont to hinder so, —
Between our feet and day!
'T were blessed to have seen.
Beautiful as pictures
You, unsuspecting, feel for me
Who never climbed the weary league —
Let us go with thee!
BEQUEST.
THE BATTLE-FIELD.
XVI.
   Upon a pile of wind
Much madness is divinest sense
   Trips frantic in a tree,
Then, like a timid man,
We wondered at our blindness, —
Some distant heaven,
A presence of departed acts
I could have touched!
And thus, without a wing,
Her sturdy little countenance
Debates if it will go.
What is only walking
   That prison doesn't keep.
A modest lot, a fame petite,
I more than once, at morn,
I tried to match it, seam by seam,
The morning, happy thing,
And praise as mere as blame.
The cautious grave exposes,
Her providence the sun,
At morning in a truffled hut
If I can ease one life the aching,
Several of nature's people
But never quaked before.
In lonesome place.
   Out of reach of skill,
To eyelids in the sepulchre.
And dream the days away, —
Met by the gods with banners
No brigadier throughout the year
REQUIEM.
Would not the fun
Since that my Lord, "the Lord of lords"
   As these that twice befell.
   On solitary hills
To lose thee, sweeter than to gain
Half glad when it is night and sleep,
But rapid, like the roe;
HUNGER.
And taste eternity.
Doubt me, my dim companion!
   In sight of native air.
A sickness of this world it most occasions
Was such still dwelling there?
In which it cautions arm,
And flower that zealous blew,
SAVED!
Too tender to be told.
A deed knocks first at thought,
Too sound asleep did lie
There 's something in their attitude
That woman and her boy
Is an imperial friend, —
Summer, sister, seraph,
That nobody might know
'T was best imperfect, as it was;
To seek for the accomplished guest, —
To an admiring bog!
   And later, when we die,
Their expectation fair;
   Now I am ready to go!
I knew not but the next
Of these no elegy.
Then chase itself down hill
The colors of the commonest;
To squirrels and to me.
Our little sexton sings.
Done with the chart.
For every little knoll,
Like a cup
At any fair.
Beware, lest this little brook of life
The stitches stopped themselves,
   His head, a cap and frill.
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
Those who read the Revelations
Gracious now to me as any,
   Into solitude! —
And went to sleep.
Oftener by the claw of dragon
That hunted, hunted so, to see,
Where presence is denied them.
His fingers, if he pass,
To food
So pretty, so ashamed!
When I was small, a woman died.
The eagle's golden breakfast
An altered look about the hills;
And bees as bustling go, —
The grass so little has to do, —
   Nor tambourine, nor man;
The wind pursued the little bush,
   And crucifixion known.
   I go no more away
The beads upon the forehead
Nor could I rise with you,
A light exists in spring
A death-blow is a life-blow to some
So quiet, oh, how quiet!
IMMORTALITY.
Second Series
That very instant passed.
It is an honorable thought,
       It hung so high,
Restraining rampant squirrel
To our penurious eyes!
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
I only sigh, — no vehicle
   Abrupt, mechanically;
If I couldn't thank you,
To sound or circumvent,
   And gurgled down and down.
If certain, when this life was out,
And warming in our own,
It waits upon the lawn;
The jury voted him.
Reminded me of mine,
A too presumptuous psalm.
At the accustomed hour!
The carriage held but just ourselves
Before the harbor lie.
   Makes he forest dry;
    Patient till paradise,
Or noon in mazarin?
At its own stable door.
Grant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,
If tolling bell I ask the cause.
   And where was the wood,
With last delight I own!
Wonderful rotation
I heard recede the disappointed tide!
That darkness is about to pass.
When I was carried by the farms, —
   And marry whom I may,
With her fastidious forehead?
Supposed they visited remote,
And now, what life or death can do
Carolled and mused and carolled,
The frost beheads it at its play
And yet your little draught of life
No easier divest
As we ride grand along.
Faith is a fine invention
   A dateless melody.
But not an hour more!
For firm conviction of a mouse
And is lost in balms!
Sweet debt of Life, — each night to owe,
What word had they for me?
In an emergency!
FOLLOWING.
And spices, and the dew,
The maples never knew
   Did round my pillow roll,
A furtive look you know as well,
Their hundred hats they raise!
   With analytic eyes;
   A glass of water's all,
It was not death, for I stood up,
'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, —
   Upon my silver shelf.
The accent of a coming foot,
Till opposite I spied a cheek
Intent upon the vision
How much can come
   How doubly more
Against the wind is seen,
There came a day at summer's full
Within the fields lie low,
   And Being but an ear,
It could not hold a sigh, —
The vane a little to the east
Pathetic from the grass,
Or giddy bird in orchard,
On its axis turned, —
The only one forestalling mine,
The wondrous nearer drew;
   His merit all my fear,
That hurried all abroad, —
I have not told my garden yet,
A member of the cloud.
All the rooms are full.
The purple territories
Is sweetest nutriment to him,
THE SEA.
Afflicts me with a double loss;
Yet not too far to come at call,
The door as sudden shut, and I,
   No wedlock granted me.
Our journey had advanced;
Who fall, and none observe,
A throe upon the features
Till sudden I perceived it stir, —
The gales indeed were done;
By frigate or by merchantman,
More fair, because impossible
   Their seam the day upon.
That we can show to-day?"
   It wasted from my sight,
But never I mind the bridges,
   And the discomfit mine.
   A perished sun
   And I omit to pray,
From all the jails the boys and girls
That shone above the fagot;
How high
A thought went up my mind to-day
There 's that long town of white to cross
Till I should jump peninsulas
You may have met him, — did you not,
The trying on the utmost,
At me, the sea withdrew.
Our lives are Swiss, —
The spirit and the dust.
Say quick, that I may dower thee
THE WAKING YEAR.
Till when they reached the other side,
A sofa to the air.
Prohibits him,
   Bride of the Holy Ghost!
The wealthy fly upon his pane,
   As daisies now to be seen.
   Does not at first appear;
    My spirit cannot see?
Three times, 't is said, a sinking man
Till bullets clipt an angle,
Before the judgment-seat of God,
Little leontodon.
If I should fail, what poverty!
So faces on two decks look back,
   To her desire seemed.
And yet it tasted like them all;
As trade had suddenly encroached
And uniforms of snow.
But overlooked my father's house,
I reason that in heaven
Past what ourselves can estimate, —
Great streets of silence led away
Whose farthest of degree
How hospitable, then, the face
The faithful witness,
Bisected now by bleaker griefs,
A book I have, a friend gave,
   Into degreeless noon.
I 'm used to that.
One will walk to-day!
Their faces upon God.
Nor simulate a throe.
And whatsoever insect pass,
This new circumference, have blamed
Just opposite, another speech
Of summer's circumspect.
LOST FAITH.
I liked as well to see
Around this quiet courtier
Belshazzar's correspondent
Oh, what an afternoon for heaven,
To whom this would have pointed me
Of ballads and of bards.
CONTRAST.
   That sense was breaking through.
My river runs to thee:
Deputed from what firmament
A pleader, a dissembler,
That shall aurora be
The grieved are many, I am told;
How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel
The foreigner before he knocks
   So easy to repair.
The wizard-fingers never rest,
Or mists the Apennine.
   To gain it, men have shown
So ominous did pass
And drove away the leaves
   Its explanation found!
   Obscured with ruddier hue.
     Nor with a stone;
Bereaved of all, I went abroad,
Titled, confirmed, — delirious charter!
At news that he ceased human nature
Unto such, were such assembly,
   If thou would'st take it now.
   A third event to me,
In cups of artificial drowse
   The aster on the hill
The brain within its groove
I 've known permission given
   The dust in streets goes down,
Or settled regions wild.
   The shaft that never knew,
The feeblest or the waywardest, —
As from an emerald ghost;
Not any higher stands the grave
The smallest housewife in the grass,
Dear to the moss,
His countenance a billow,
   When you approach the place.
The body grows outside, —
The fathoms they abide.
Which both of benediction
It puzzled me to know,
Where men made hay, then struggling hard
Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
   A thing that can ignite
That such a day, permitted so,
ASPIRATION.
   And all we need of hell.
Lathed with down.
   Is culpabler than shame.
Till those two troubled little clocks
I had no cause to be awake,
    Sits shyly at his feet.
If birds should build as early,
The heart I cherished in my own
The liberty to die.
It just reminded me — 't was all —
LOST.
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
And then be soldered down,
On miscellaneous enterprise
So foreign to my own.
She died, — this was the way she died;
UNWARNED.
SETTING SAIL.
   And sow my blossoms o'er!
Then, how the fire ebbs like billows,
And might o'erwhelm me so!
   The reason deeper lies, —
The one that could repeat the summer day
Neglected son of genius,
   When 'Brontë' entered there!
I meant to have but modest needs,
Or a leaving home; or later,
I wished they 'd stay away
The entering takes away.
The mighty merchant smiled.
Was grateful for the roses
Would the Eden be an Eden,
In forest and the hill
   Who sang full many a day,
Where midnight frosts had lain!
Circumference between.
It might be easier
The bee is not afraid of me,
Of immortality
A contrast to our respites.
Later by just an hour than death, —
The brain is wider than the sky,
Upon the waters borne,
   Termed immortality.
And a softness the teller's eye;
That made the pellet mine, —
And though the skies are crowded,
Is more distinctly seen, —
With only butterflies to brood,
Since I could never find her
Almost thy plausibility
To Nowhere seemed to go
Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?
   In country far from here,
At half-past four, experiment
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
How good to be safe in tombs,
But her Carrara guide-post, —
Than all the golden presence
Too plummetless that it come back
   And she had hearkened him.
As ankles of a queen, —
These are the days when birds come back,
Of early hurt, if such a lapse
A further force of life
Of independent hues,
   And guile is where it goes.
    Of morning and the moor,
Our pace took sudden awe,
   Her visitor no more.
    Is unavailable.
Not death; for who is he?
   I thought how it would be
It's such a common glory,
   Or emptied by the sun
That till I loved
   Why swagger then?
    Were undefeated still?
Leaving a new necessity, —
   As the attempt to rise.
And still the pensive spring returns,
 
With implements to fly away,
   His countenance to see,
REMEMBRANCE.
THE BRAIN.
   In parlors shut by day.
I think I won't, however,
Since that appalling day!
   And guinea in the sand, —
     I've known
Develops pearl and weed,
If anybody sneer,
Nor visited in heaven;
Obsequious angels wait!
My river waits reply.
How dreary to be somebody!
The grave was finished, but the spade
   His musket on his breast;
A word is dead
XXXIV.
A spider sewed at night
Behold the keenest marksman!
Which if they do not fit for earth
And carts went stooping round the fields
Our summer made her light escape
Stooping as low as the otter's window,
Repudiates the obligation,
Let no sunrise' yellow noise
As will suffice to light her lamps;
   For this enchanted size.
At least to know the worst is sweet.
With hat in hand, polite and new,
   We men and women die!
The bravest of the host,
Who counts the wampum of the night,
One dignity delays for all,
Or else a peacock's purple train,
       By climbing slow,
She felt herself supremer, —
Somebody flings a mattress out, —
    Of unanointed blaze.
    But when the vivid ore
Then draw my little letter forth
   Till, some odd afternoon,
   I open every door;
   It had the tassels on.
   Will reward the hand;
Only scantly and selectly,
We learn in the retreating
I thought that storm was brief, —
   Then I am ready to go!
And leaves the shreds behind;
Old-fashioned, naughty, everything, —
And wear, if God should count me fit,
   A fitting a despair.
Nor implement was seen,
And I had put away
Will idle lie, in Auburn, —
Were toward eternity.
Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window;
RESURGAM.
A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
But they that go.
XXXV.
They say that 'time assuages,' —
Lingers to record thee;
To sing unto the stone
Your riches taught me poverty.
That love is life,
The frosts were her condition;
But this must be a different wealth,
And yet its whole career
When was it, can you tell,
       This was all.
   The bushes they were bells;
   I often wonder he
And chatted close with this grand thing
Butterflies pause
EPITAPH.
Meet — and the junction be Eternity?
Invisible, as music,
But let a splinter swerve,
I know not which thy chamber is, —
Weary, perhaps, and sore.
With gay delays he goes
But we stood whispering in the house,
   No less bereaved to be
On Revolution Day?
Yet that whip's name too noble
Of our old neighbor, God!
The everlasting clocks
Write me how many notes there be
A coronet to find;
If I should stab the patient faith
"For beauty," I replied.
For any golden fleece;
And I tip — drunken.
Ashes denote that fire was;
   But then I had the dew!
So choosing but a gown
Between eternity and time,
Her heart misgives her for her vow,
   I charge him, fly!
ENOUGH.
Upon the village I perceived, —
But medicine posthumous
PSALM OF THE DAY.
Went wandering down the latitudes,
And tell you all your dreams were true;
As slow her flambeaux burn away,
That beckoned it away!
Defeat means nothing but defeat,
Wherefore, O summer's day?
If such it prove, it prove too
Adjusts its tumbled head, —
To-night in thee!
   Go down the fields to hay!
She sweeps with many-colored brooms,
A sloop of amber slips away
A wishfulness their far condition
A diadem to fit a dome
With an opposing cloud,
Was that she might,
Our share of night to bear,
Oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,
   This, and my heart beside,
Will peep, and prance again.
"Tell him night finished before we finished,
And now an amethyst remembrance
At Deity's decree.
At least, 't is mutual risk, —
   Vanquished, my soul will know,
And yet, as poor as I
Each one salutes me as he goes,
Seed of palm by Lybian sun
The pillow of this daring head
There came a wind like a bugle;
I 've often seen them play
He knew no more that he was poor,
   Afforded royally.
Not one of all the purple host
WHY?
In an adjoining room.
It was a short procession, —
And men that made the hay,
Disparagement discreet, —
Ticked softly into one.
The peace, the flight, the amethyst,
Brought out their burrs and mosses
That slipped my simple fingers through
The figures I have seen
It was as if a chirping brook
XXIX.
Peculiar traveller comes?
Unbraiding in the sun, —
That phraseless melody
Presuming me to be a mouse
THE STORM.
Rocked softer, to and fro?
The surreptitious scion
A face devoid of love or grace,
It makes an even face
Before I got my eye put out,
XLVIII.
As an evening west
To lead it here;
For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb
The regiment of wood and hill
Nor that his frame was dust.
How excellent the heaven,
Has anybody found?
Submits that home and certainty
Upon a shining sea, —
Wild-flowers kindle in the woods,
The neighbors do not yet suspect!
Receive me cordially.
   Before its emblem flew.
A wisdom without face or name,
Had there been no sharp subtraction
Is of within;
Till qualified for pearl,
SONG.
This is the land the sunset washes,
How well I knew the light before!
Is not expressed by suns alone,
DYING.
   To con thee o'er and o'er,
And when the hills are full,
It ruffles wrists of posts,
To take a backward look.
The lily waiting to be wed,
   Accompanied with tear,
I wonder if when years have piled —
Death sets a thing significant
Break, agonized and clear!
Can blaze be done in cochineal,
Until the designated light
The sexton keeps the key to,
Just quartering a tree.
   To occupy.
   For refuse and the mouse,
That comprehendeth me
Could she a son contemn,
   I dissect the play;
Who 'll let me out some gala day,
His haughty, spangled hems,
   And we accost no more.
Her rusty ammunition
In gentle deference to me,
Their hock and sherry draw,
The flesh surrendered, cancelled,
And made the hurry plain.
    Passing pomposity?
When I at last awake.
   And that by right that he
God preaches, — a noted clergyman, —
Hurries a timid leaf!
Is where the angels are.
Behind, a sealed route,
Tell him — No, you may quibble there,
An hour behind the fleeting breath,
Enacted upon earth, —
The saints shall meet
On Pizarro's shore?
To touch,
Our faith to regulate.
How many trips the tortoise makes,
LIFE'S TRADES.
Given in marriage unto thee,
THE GOAL.
   Till the ball is full, —
Can read without its glasses
As if the resurrection
To measure off another day
But this time, adequate, erect,
   For death was that, and this is thee.
Of an entire attar
It is as swans discarded you
THE TULIP.
And dwell a little everywhere,
'Tis harder knowing it is due,
   Is it too large for you?
    No eye could find the place;
My life closed twice before its close;
Forbidden fruit a flavor has
An hour to prepare;
I'm feeling for the air;
Her glory I should know:
As twilight long begun,
And space stares, all around,
Indolent housewife, in daisies lain!
Within my reach!
The hosts of witness stand!
Shone closer by.
He kindly stopped for me;
Step lightly on this narrow spot!
Some shook their heads, and others smiled,
That such was not the posture
Thy consecrated bread to break,
On what concerns our mutual mind,
My fingers were awake;
   Drill silently for heaven.
   I will forget the light.
How frugal is the chariot
Angels in the early morning
The splendor of a Burmah,
I will not be pursued!
The dusk kept dropping, dropping still;
Was but a book. What liberty
   The figures hunched with pain,
Least village boasts its blacksmith,
Peruse how infinite I am
'T is whiter than an Indian pipe,
A flower's unobtrusive face
Clasped yet to him and me.
Among the pensive trees.
Till I take vaster attitudes,
A pensive custom it becomes,
Yield her moat of pearl,
I said: "'T will keep."
Sailing silently,
Yet know I how the heather looks,
   Affecting our content,
THE FUNERAL.
As if my life were shaven
Unfair an immortality
Tankard, or spoon,
Like neighbor from another world
Because — because if he should die
   For he is grasped of God.
The lightning skipped like mice;
Such transport breaks upon the town
"The bumble-bees will wake them
It cannot recollect
I cannot live with you,
Without her diadem.
In search of something, as it seemed,
Dissuade thee if I could not, sweet,
And softly through the altered air
I meant to find her when I came;
And visited the sea;
My story has a moral:
The crowd respectful grew.
That make the circuit of the rest,
   It passes, and we stay:
Of cathedral tunes.
XLIX.
   Be judgment what it may.
   Or did it just begin?
New periods of pain.
Or in the desert cloy, —
Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
   But something held my will.
And birds take places overhead,
News is he of all the others;
Was ratified this way.
   Frail little heart!
But meat within is requisite,
It's like the morning, —
Just his sigh, accented,
I'm wife! stop there!
But sequence ravelled out of reach
And grace would grant the pair.
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
And yet how still the landscape stands,
Nor noticed that the ebbing day
    And I, no other prayer.
Red is the fire's common tint;
To me shows insecure.
For life's estate with you.
I wore an hour ago.
It can't be summer, — that got through;
Between my finite eyes.
   I know I heard the corn,
The distance would not haunt me so;
Drink, and are gone.
You dropped a purple ravelling in,
And we, we placed the hair,
The sky!
These are the visions baffled Guido;
And they can put it with my dolls,
To miss it beggars so.
But, March, forgive me —
THE COMING OF NIGHT.
A sudden expectation,
Menagerie to me
The summer's empty room,
   And anchor off the bar,—
What one broke off with
It was a boundless place to me,
When cancelled by the frost.
   As women do their gown,
Fair play —
And our new hands
Too fair
The morning fluttered, staggered,
And celestial women,
It lay unmentioned, as the sea
Many's the gallant, overwhelmed creature
Of numerous humming-birds at once
To break it to the bee.
And mists are carved away, —
The stars the trinkets at her belt,
He stirred his velvet head
A BOOK.
   And only nails the eyes.
Needs but to remember
When the rivers overflow,
To-day her only boy
Enamoured of the parting west,
Good night! which put the candle out?
Not knowing when the dawn will come
   Have settled with the year! —
Far off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,
Afterwards — day!
And of "truth" until it proclaimed him a liar, —
When night devoured the road;
That such have lived, certificate
In the new robin's ecstasy
Tranquil, as to repose,
The literature of old;
I measure every grief I meet
THIRST.
Can tell the definition,
   Nor simplified her ghost.
One with the banner gay,
I 'm sure it is Golconda,
Recording briefly, "Lost."
   The pod that Duty locks!
Dispelled from there;
Alter? When the hills do.
And if forgetting, recollecting,
Who since they went to their account
The bobolinks begun.
Three weeks passed since I had seen her, —
How many the fictitious shores
When truth, affronted long,
Their coming back seems possible
We like March, his shoes are purple,
But called the others clear,
And were you saved,
The general rose decays;
What was his furthest mind, of home, or God,
The roof was scarcely visible,
   That 'heaven' is, to me.
The show is not the show,
His notice sudden is.
When earth cannot be had;
   I trudge the day away,—
   The children hurry by;
Amid no bells nor bravos
And wishes, had he any?
COMPENSATION.
And be of buttercups the friend
When men and boys, and larks and June
FORGOTTEN.
So preconcerted with itself,
What opulence the more
And will at home and well.
   So I shall never fall;
Than one of higher temperature
I offered Being for it;
They "noticed" me — they noticed me;
Lest anybody find;
When floods have slit the hills,
And though the sum was simple,
In odors so divine,
Than oars divide the ocean,
I thought just how red apples wedged
What once was heaven, is zenith now.
The grave would hinder me,
Bedecked with thee,
Expressed or still;
Our feet were almost come
And this bequest of wings
Behold the atom I preferred
And scarce of diadems
There was a little figure plump
A lord might dare to lift the hat
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
Step lofty; for this name is told
And thread the dews all night, like pearls,
I struggled, and was there.
   Jehovah told to her,
Was dying as he thought, or different;
Would seem to me the proper way
   The north, to-night!
Is slowly handed back,
Set bleeding feet to minuets
   To take us lands away,
On my homesick eye,
   Sagacity must go.
If you were coming in the fall,
And though I may not guess the kind
   And when Thanksgiving came,
   She reached the asphodel!
A snake is summer's treason,
And so the walls don't tell,
Then look out for the little brook in March,
    Had importuned to see!
Not exorcised before,
And get the dimples ready,
ASTRA CASTRA.
Magnanimous of bird
For each ecstatic instant
Which, when to patience grown,
SUMMER'S ARMIES.
Was needless, as at sacrament
But prayer remained our side.
From our gross eyes.
Behind my native town.
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
It might be famine all around,
Come slowly, Eden!
The little toil of love, I thought,
   And creak across my soul
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
I could not tell the date of mine,
Lest anybody spy the blood
Without a light
When Fate hath taunted last
By soldiers battered down,
Sauntered as soft away!
I scanned the windows near;
WITH FLOWERS.
   In passing Calvary,
That taunts her bayonet.
The Maker's cordial visage,
A bird, by chance, that goes that way

A ribbon at a time.
Can stand so close and look so bold
Whose are the beds, the tiny beds
'T was a long parting, but the time
Within the Orchard is not heard,
A TEMPEST.
The night was wide, and furnished scant
To such, if they should whisper
Orchard, and buttercup, and bird —
The moon slides down the stair
The dust replaced in hoisted roads,
His conversation seldom,
Proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,
As gold the pyrites would shun.
And kingdoms, like the orchard,
She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking. She was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist in pretence.
EXCLUSION.
The glimmering frontier
A bone has obligations,
But were it told to me, to-day,
THE MYSTERY OF PAIN.
It was not frost, for on my flesh
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies.
To pity those that know her not
The angels must have spied,
With but a fraction of the love
With one small diadem.
That not a Santa Claus could reach
I make my parlor orderly,
   The bolt upon the door,
I could not,
The thought beneath so slight a film
And heaven not enough for me;
Edited by
Till it is lost in fleeces;
As cautiously as glass,
Whose fingers string the stalactite,
Though my name
The monster's faded eyes
To neighborhoods of pause;
A clover, any time, to him
Superfluous were the sun
'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,
To satin races he is nought;
RESURRECTION.
Or sought to;
The tired flocks come in
A COUNTRY BURIAL.
WEDDED.
"Unto the little, unto me,"
I noticed people disappeared,
Some touch it and some kiss it,
Approached, the amber flits a little, —
An azure depth, a wordless tune,
Transcending ecstasy.
A chief indifference, as foreign
Tenderly took it up from toil
Scares muslin souls away;
THE JUGGLER OF DAY.
Severer triumph, by himself
A DAY.
Him you chasten, that is he!
Drifts were as difficult then to think
Have not each one of us the right
   Termed mortality!
Who has not found the heaven below
'T was later when the summer went
Who never wanted, — maddest joy
That "God have mercy" on the soul
   'T is the vermin's will.
The prudent carries a revolver,
There was no purple suitable,
Saves she all of that for sunsets, —
With threatening tunes and low, —
At bases of the trees, —
   The woods exchange a smile —
Had not the bliss so slow a pace, —
   Upon an ether sea,
The skies can't keep their secret!
Then put their nightgowns on.
   In quiet Haworth laid.
   Is plenty! Is enough!
Except that you, than he
   And this mechanic stone
And he passed quickly round!
People like the moth,
     A miracle for all!
Meek at whose everlasting feet
I feel for them a transport
And whatsoever is consumed
That what we cherished, so unknown
Her simple haunts beyond!
III.
A myriad daisies play.
And narrow at the floor,
Enabled of the eye,
If tenderer industriousness
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Until the bees, from clover rows
Of mines I little know, myself,
   He stuns you by degrees,
Our share of morning,
As of brier and leaf displayed
My flowers raise their pretty lips,
The brooks brag all the day;
It suits his own austerity,
To know if he was patient, part content,
Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
A day when it was not.
Anger as soon as fed is dead;
I never saw the sea;
The wealth might disappoint,
I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;
XXXII.
By clocks 't was morning, and for night
And what a wave must be.
The eye had hurried by,
He never misses a degree;
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear,
He deposes doom,
For this new value in the soul,
But the least push of joy
   I should not fear the fight.
The tapestries of paradise
I shall but drink the more!
POEMS
And know no other way.
With will to choose or to reject.
Perhaps a squirrel may remain,
"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,
Sauntering this way,
   That never seats but one,
Beneficent, believe me,
And keeps the soul serene,
Never the treasures in her nest
"I will inquire again.
In deference to him
   Menacing the tree,
Lest we too awkward show
Did the harebell loose her girdle
That commerce will continue,
GRIEFS.
To the ecstasy.
Supplanted all the rest.
   Into the purple well,
I never hear the word "escape"
I pray you stroll once more!
Touching the roof and tinting the barn,
Myself a poorer prove
There's grief of want, and grief of cold, —
Till love that was, and love too blest to be,
A joyous-going fellow
   But positive, as sound.
And all we said was "Saved"!
   At distance than at hand.
Crackling with fever, they essay;
   For arrogance of them.
I thank these kinsmen of the shelf;
Tell him the page I didn't write;
Was large enough for me.
We cover thee, sweet face.
And doesn't care about careers,
Drowning is not so pitiful
I clap my hands to see;
That mushroom, — it is him.
Only to fail again!
Going to heaven!
Imps in eager caucus
The seasons fit the same,
   Some one the sum could tell, —
   Unto my frugal eye,
As if some caravan of sound
In accidental power.
   I might have aided thee.
A flower superfluous blown;
To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some time in the finished picture.
   I sat me down to sigh.
   Respect the grayest pile
The sun kept setting, setting still;
   Where none of us should be,
For an approving God.
You see, God bless his suddenness,
Hope is the thing with feathers
Made nature different.
Be its mattress straight,
Because I could not stop for Death,
Experiment to me
   Now shadows in the tomb.
The dust did scoop itself like hands
Of 'Potosi' and the mines!
May be seen the dews among,
   Grant that we may stand,
   Enlightening misery.
I.
In timid honesty.
Sweet litigants for life.
She's dreaming of the woods."
Unto the sofa opposite,
Who of little love
Are so superfluous cold,
God keeps his oath to sparrows,
To wander now is my abode;
Rhodora's cheek is crimson, —
Baronial bees march, one by one,
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,
THE SHOW.
Our departed are.
They cannot take us any more, —
With thoughts that make for peace.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
   Her hallowed mystery.
These are the western mystery!
Still fascinated to presume
Close to the two I lost!
Their lessons scarcely done;
I 'm finite, I can't see.
And then reluctant turn,
I should have been too saved, I see,
Requires sorest need.
O Jesus! in the air
The daisy follows soft the sun,
But never deemed the dripping prize
   Within my loving creed.
Low amid that glad Belles lettres
The soul that asked its shelter
   A hubbub as of feet;
   Than the meadow mild,
I dared not open, lest a face
Whose fingers brush the sky,
A raised, ethereal thing;
And the sermon is never long;
That wearing on your breast,
   And we look farther on.
And tantalize, just so.
Cautious, hint to any captive
   Upon a common summer's morn,
In human nature's west!
Our interview was transient,—
The angels labored diligent;
So leisurely were we!
A guest in this stupendous place,
   Confronting us again!
As far from pity as complaint,
   And tell your cedar floor.
   I half indifferent viewed,
To counteract a knock;
To know if any human eyes were near
Secure against its own,
And sportsman is not bold.
Into renown!
XVII.
Could make assignable, — and then
Of your viands and your wines!
Life's latitude leant over-full;
Imported to the wood;
I recollect it well!
Into the sea, in passing,
When viewed through pain, —
Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less
And closer to the fire
Where revelations be.
And the juggler of day is gone!
The children of whose turbaned seas,
I had no time to hate, because
We estimate our prize,
Horizons straggled down.
It will not stir for doctors,
   Of prancing poetry.
In dun or fair.
Auto-da-fe and judgment
There 's triumph in the room
Dropped by memory.
IV.
Redemption, brittle lady,
   But, when her worst was done,
And opens further on.
   Themselves should come to me.
Where parties, phantom as herself,
    By withes of supple blue?
And so, as kinsmen met a night,
I think that earth seems so
We thirst at first, — 't is Nature's act;
He, waking, finds the flower near.
Upon an arc of white.
I'll tell you how the sun rose, —
The way I read a letter 's this:
   Oh, thou celestial host!
A whip, so small you could not see it.
Strews the landing with opal bales;
The breaking of the day.
Won't be new-fashioned when I come,
   And every clamor bright
In using wore away,
A marrowless assembly
No brimming tankards flow.
The opening of a door!
   At bottom of my mind;
They wonder if It died on that, —
   Until, to her surprise,
It cannot be my spirit,
Pursuing winds that censure us
Life is but life, and death but death!
   To the parish night;
   While cool, concernless No
At such and such a time.
If I should die,
It intimates the finer want,
And push it with my fingers next,
And showed their dimples, too.
Wonder upon wonder
   Of immortality
Scan, like him, the stately landscape
Belshazzar had a letter, —
There's plunder, — where?
THE JOURNEY.
Some new equation given;
   And art thou sleeping yet?
Since breaking then, since breaking then,
It 's sharpest of the theme
Whether my bark went down at sea,
It stops upon a spot
While simple-hearted neighbors
And independent as the sun,
   On a summer's day;
Slow tramp the centuries,
   Like balls upon a floor.
Stiller than the fields
But proud in apparition,
At her low gate;
If nature will not tell the tale
Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,
The wealth I had contented me;
   For all the rest of life.
DREAMS.
   Drop Gabriel and me.
The hills untied their bonnets,
Four have recovered the land;
The thunder crumbled like a stuff —
   Were nothing very odd!
Heart not so heavy as mine,
East of eternity;
Demur, — you're straightway dangerous,
Blue sea, wilt welcome me?
   Be so, ashamed of thee.
Who overcame most times
All swindlers be, infer.
And make itself so fine, —
And, supercilious, peer
EXPERIENCE.
And Nicodemus' mystery
   I had not strength to hold.
   But could not make them fit.
And anguish absolute,
Now it is night in nest and kennel,
If summer were an axiom,
There are, that resting, rise.
The quiet nonchalance of death
When I hoped I feared,
The stimulus, beyond the grave
To a discerning eye;
   Would feel as thoroughly at ease
The snow and he are intimate;
He grasped, he bore away.
Assassin, hid in our apartment,
My labor, and my leisure too,
Themselves forsake contented,
   Or billows like a shore?
And wishfulness in me arose
That is solemn we have ended, —
The doom's electric moccason
And he unrolled his feathers
I said, but just to be a bee
I never hear of prisons broad
The track called land.
And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That other state;
FIRE.
   Dukes for setting sun!
That only to the ear of God
If the foolish call them 'flowers,'
     Thou puzzlest me!
That brews that rare variety.
THE BALLOON.
'T is so much joy! 'T is so much joy!
Her companies astir, —
On this superior soil;
L.
And only the waves reply.
It hurls its barbed syllables,—
   All interspersed with weed,
Emerged — a summer afternoon —
On their passage Cashmere;
XLII.
I did not love enough.
    Extinguished, now, for you!
The day was warm, and winds were prosy;
Too jostled were our souls to speak,
Her deathless syllable.
Then lightly as a reed
Who win, and nations do not see,
   Her annual secret keeps;
Propounded but a single term
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!
Incites the timid prayer
The dead shall go in white.
Fantastic sailors mingle,
Strangers strolled and spelled
Attireth that it hear
The lightning that preceded it
Ajar, secure, inviting;
THE BLUEBIRD.
To hear an oriole sing
For his civility.
And when they all were seated,
   And how I just said 'please.'
What first,
But Nature lost the date of this,
MY DEAR FRIEND,— What portfolios full of verses you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and generation" that you will not give them light.
   For immortality.
Oh, housewife in the evening west,
A perfect, paralyzing bliss
   Remained in memory.
A triumph when temptation's bribe
My poignant luxury
Glow plain and foreign
Few get enough, — enough is one;
And drew the head erect;
The mornings blossom into noons,
And then the pious form
Would anybody sigh
   Yielded grape and maize.
He flung a menace at the earth,
I gained it so,
A few went out to help the brook,
   What ultimate for that?
But how he set, I know not.
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;
She stung him, sapped his firm advance,
XIII.
   For his beloved need,
   Continual crowning me.
THE LOST JEWEL.
   Within this inner room!
THE FIRST LESSON.
   Whose adequate supply
   By my own choice and thee.
Till everlasting life unite
In the name of the bee
And summer hid her forehead,
My little craft was lost!
Her fingers fumbled at her work, —
I tried to drop it in the crowd,
   That, in so dense a fuzz,
To gain the purple democrat
No bone had he to bind him,
And there the matter ends.
You've seen balloons set, haven't you?
At first repeat it slow!
Doubtless we should deem superfluous
The date, and manner of the shame;
And is held low to freezing lips
You cannot prick with saw,
I do not care about it,
It powders all the wood,
Were climbing all the while
The bobolink was there,
And it is bells within.
   No fear you'll miss the road.
Into the lap of adamant,
Bears me along that way.
As all the heavens were a bell,
Or, haply, mistletoe.
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
   Can nightingale be seen.
   Wrinkled any bay, —
   Such houses have alway.
Is shifted like a sand;
And no one made reply.
I have at last revenge.
Pray do not ask me how, —
The dreamy butterflies bestir,
The butterfly's assumption-gown,
   The likest I have known.
By means of it in God's ear;
Than when the cricket came,
Tell me how far the morning leaps,
But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies
What is forbidden utterly
And they will differ, if they do,
Their feet upon temptation,
Concluded and begun
Or early task to do?
Soil of flint if steadfast tilled
Why, I will lend until just then,
Noons like these she rose,
When winds go round and round in bands,
   When best men die;
       As well the sky
THE SLEEPING FLOWERS.
The twilight stood as strangers do
   The bee, dost thou forget?
It pleased my narrow eyes
Exists in every human nature
A PORTRAIT.
   I envy spokes of wheels
   From an abundant sky.
Acquitted from that naked bar,
Baffle, if it cost you
   The stubble's joints between;
A solemn thing it was, I said,
If in that room a friend await
   But the remotest star!
Then, if it have burrowed
That oceans are,
   Or that ethereal zone
   Then I remember not;
Before their feet are cold.
Old-fashioned eyes,
I reason, earth is short,
And God forbid I look behind
Fern-odors on untravelled roads, —
   Your brain to bubble cool, —
To venerate the simple days
This dusty heart espied;
It beckons and it baffles;
Then stepped straight through the firmament
On a strange mob of panting trees,
Impossible to feign
And sore must be the storm
I 'm knocking everywhere.
Nor heedless by the way
The trusting woods?
And neigh like Boanerges;
This democrat is dressed,
To an insulted sky,
I felt apology were due
The thimble weighed too heavy,
They spurn the air as 't were too mean
To see that I made no mistake
Was bridal e'er like this?
And she pours soft refrains
   Who tight in dungeons are.
His quaint opinions to inspect,
But most like chaos, — stopless, cool, —
Over the stile of pearl!
One would as soon assault a plush
With "This was last her fingers did,"
Meanwhile at many cradles
Merchantmen poise upon horizons,
HOPE.
The blond assassin passes on,
So sunset shuts my question down
'T was just this time last year I died.
In Nature's dining-room.
No stature has it, like a fog,
Rowing in Eden!
Mine, by the grave's repeal
You drifted your dominions
On revelation's wall.
Or wind's bright signal to the ear,
While, chiefest of the crowd,
That science cannot overtake,
   To discourse alone;
Still is the bustle in the brook,
Is terribler than wearing it
That spices fly
Better will be the ecstasy
And still within a summer's night
A toad can die of light!
Disdained them, from the sky,
VIII.
But I would not exchange the bolt
At our stupidity,
But no man moved me till the tide
Although I prove it just in time
She slept beneath a tree
   When I am, long ago,
And shut the windows down so close
It's finer not to know;
I pull a flower from the woods, —
My little circuit would have shamed
Without the sterile perquisite
There, — sandals for the barefoot;
That interrupts the morn
And broke against my ear.
To all the lists of clay!
And led the flock away.
And Occident becomes unknown,
Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;
At half-past three a single bird
       Attempt by strategy.
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
His separation from his rose
Afternoons to play.
What then? Why, nothing, only,
Anecdotes of air in dungeons
Men do not sham convulsion,
THE SUN'S WOOING.
   Is heaven then so sad?
But I was twice as bold.
That rambles in the road alone,
I say it just
Far ends of tired days;
Would anybody care
To reach
   So short a thing to sigh;
   Since Yorkshire hills are green,
And struggles in the lanes,
I never spoke with God,
Transplanted to the road.
Receives its annual reply.
'T was sooner when the cricket went
Myself felt ill and odd,
   That I my thoughts may dim;
One need not be a chamber to be haunted,
And one upon the rack.
And now, I'm different from before,
And yet, my primer suits me so
Too lifted for the scant degree
Except through this extent,
With but a single star,
To-morrow, night will come again,
An imperial affliction
   To the native land.
Indebtedness to oxygen
(The wind is prince of those).
I shall not live in vain;
And then I started too.
A lady white within the field
Where this is said to be
Her bonnet is the firmament,
His helmet is of gold;
Where the maids?
Depart, before the host has slid
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
To think of answering you!
Nature, the gentlest mother,
   With every morning's beam.
Trailed slow along the orchards
In crayon or in wool,
Falter? When the sun
Unless we dine on tip-toe.
   A being has the same;
His bill an auger is,
His small umbrella, quaintly halved,
To invest existence with a stately air,
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
Ample make this bed.
He wore no sandal on his foot,
   Just as the dawn was red,
And ate the fellow, raw.
For credibility's temerity
Oftener through realm of briar
An unconcern so sovereign
While just a girl at school!
Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?
'T was such a little, little boat
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.
It is the gift of screws.
Everywhere alone
Upon a foreign shore
And cooling tamarind.
How many times they bore
Or porch of gnome,
The broad are too broad to define;
   And covenant gentians frill,
So hidden in her leaflets,
AT LENGTH.
Upon the window-pane
   Of that waylaying light.
God gave a loaf to every bird,
    They speak of what we owe;
    Dim, long-expectant eyes,
   With ease, and you beside.
   That dot his distant eaves,
   For creatures so renowned.
   As players at the keys
   Let every babbler be.
There is a word
As the third sycamore.
Lethargic pools resume the whir
   As sinews do, with age.
My cocoon tightens, colors tease,
May be a common thing,
Contending with the grass,
I wonder if it weighs like mine,
See where it hurt me, — that 's enough, —
Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!
IN A LIBRARY.
A troubadour upon the elm
SUCCESS.
   Ecstatically leap, —
As if some little Arctic flower,
at the request of "H.H.," the author's
For passing Calvary.
Please to tell a little pilgrim
So, wondering, thro' the hours meek
None may teach it anything,
Has it feathers like a bird?
Rank after rank, with even feet
THE MOON.
The divine intoxication
Two butterflies went out at noon
From enterprise below!
Tell him I only said the syntax,
Become so wondrous dear,
Hast thou no arm for me?
Her admonition mild
Some pilgrim thirst to slake, —
   Myself can hold the key.
CHOICE.
All this, and more I cannot tell,
The gilded creature strains and spins,
Not in this world to see his face
Reviewed it with my eyes,
The bystanders will tell!
Within its precincts hopes have played, —
To those who look on you
A shady friend for torrid days
Sparrows unnoticed by the Father;
As children, swindled for the first,
"Their bed-time 't is," she said;
A long, long sleep, a famous sleep
Much as formerly?
   The apple on the tree,
Let me not mar that perfect dream
XXXVI.
   Without a listener?
It may be wilderness without,
Till all the churchyard rang;
Other betrothal shall dissolve,
To fight aloud is very brave,
Spinning upon the shoals!
And so I always bear the cup
SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.
One eye upon the heaven renounced
But where it fell
To times when he was young.
While she must finish quite,
Is easier to find
Looking back is best that is left,
   It was before!
Its doom is audible.
When roses cease to bloom, dear,
Blown tremulous in glass.
   As doth the meadow-bee,
It flings a crystal veil
   Whose Genesis is June.
I never thought that Jason sought
No blackbird bates his jargoning
That could abash the little bird
   I would not break thee:
Mine, while the ages steal!
Obviate parade.
A ditty of the street;
A face with which a stone
   Phantasms both become,
And were you lost, I would be,
   In placid lily sleeps!
For heaven is a different thing
Reaching late his flower,
His spirit grew robust;
As unto crowd.
And was he confident until
But so adjust my daily night
It might have been the waning lamp
But how shall finished creatures
Some manner of the hair, —
   I kept the 'house at hame.'
If spoken by the distant bird,
   To no precarious man.
All day, among the crowded air,
They fling their speech
   On time's first afternoon!
The quiet ages picked it up,
And went against the world;
   Or better, run away
Fulfilling absolute decree
Insolvent, every noon.
For sordid excellence
Here was no notice, no dissent,
INVISIBLE.
     Because it flies!
Eclipse was all we could see at the window,
And when this mournful ditty,
'T was not so much as David had,
Taketh away my will;
   Oh, what a livid boon!
A witchcraft yieldeth me.
   Until we meet a snake;
It tossed and tossed, —
Sequestered afternoon.
Its past, enlightened to perceive
Bitter contested farthings
Turned slowly to his native coast,
Of freckled human nature,
So bashful when I spied her,
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
I wish I were the hay!
Was God so economical?
Where hope and he part company, —
Talked softly of new species
But when the woods were painted
Alluded to no time
   Some thousands — on the cause
Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor!
NOTE. — This poem may have had, like many others, a
And fences fled away,
A finer shame of ecstasy
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Where I have rambled so,
Facts, centuries before,
   Would never be believed.
And touched the curious wine.
It was as if a bobolink,
Hover, hesitate,
You took it all with you.
Wherever runs the breathless sun,
Her lips of amber never part;
Bolder to fly away,
And go to pieces on the stones
Until eternity.
The meadows mine, the mountains mine, —
My worthiness is all my doubt,
And wishes, and denies, —
From house to house 't was noon.
And putting love away
The shopman importunes it,
Unto my books so good to turn
That threatened childhood's citadel
As it passed my window
Father, I bring thee not myself, —
   Or diamonds, when I see
PLAYMATES.
Before the blackbirds sing.
Unknown, refreshing things;
I dared not meet the daffodils,
   By an auroral stain,
Flowed silver to the west,
He stayed away a year, to call
And much can go,
That it can so endure
The cavalry of woe.
Chamber and state and throng;
Ah! the bewildering thread!
   It grew as I pursued,
Laurel! veil your deathless tree, —
A drop fell on the apple tree,
And satisfy, obtained.
   We envy the despair
Take care, for God is here,
It 's time to smooth the hair
Fingers denied the plucking,
And maelstrom in the sea;
If any would avenge, —
Is Heaven a physician?
Immortal is an ample word
   Or shy of troubling her.
Contrasting which, my qualities
Some rainbow coming from the fair!
AFTERMATH.
We only know what time of year
    Ah! friend, you little knew
   To that ethereal throng
Then, as horizons step,
Nearest the door to wake the first,
   The tranquiller to die;
Pass back and forth before my brain,
    Repudiate the forge.
I had rather dwell like her
Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
   Supremest earthly sum.
   No Caspian could be.
Had I, a humble maiden,
The very nearest room,
But that thyself fatigue of us;
It half endears the abstinence,
And that defies me, — as a hand
Each that we lose takes part of us;
Her everlasting fashion set,
Defeat, an outgrown anguish,
Shall meet the eye of traitor
   I take thee by the hand.
The sun has got as far
Nor was I hungry; so I found
A foe so reticent.
   Should disenthrall thy soul.
They say that He can heal;
As numb to revelation
And revery.
Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace
And waltzed above a stream,
To comprehend a nectar
As when 't was cut at Lexington,
Transporting must the moment be,
   But human nature feels.
THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.
   A brief campaign of sting and sweet
   Parting with a world
Are you nobody, too?
He did not know I saw;
THE MOUNTAIN.
   And strut upon my stem,
Which, sir, are you, and which am I,
   To get away from you, —
Should startle most;
Dear March, come in!
I had a crimson robin
Have never passed her haunted house,
Was that confiding prodigal,
Despair!
Belles from some lost summer day,
And blame the scanty love
Ring the tree and leave it, —
A power of butterfly must be
My splendors are menagerie;
No nearer, lest reality
If any ask me why,
Had nature an Iscariot,
Mine by the right of the white election!
Empowered with what malevolence
And I my childish plumes
So dazzling, we mistake him
As soon impeach my crown!
An island in dishonored grass,
Until it puzzled came
A flippant fly upon the pane;
My sentiments to share.
The only raiment I should need,
Since then 't is centuries; but each
But this involves the grave.
   Their anchors fast;
His future a dispute;
All, for him, straightway.
This covert have all the children
Yet certain am I of the spot
   Among the cunning cells,
   They would not rather die.
The gentian weaves her fringes,
Will lift his little girl, —
Alas! that frowns could lie in wait
   The walls began to tell;
Of latitudes unknown.
Upon a new peninsula, —
I know it by the numb look
Its temple stands alway
And Sophocles a man;
What liberty! So captives deem
His inquest everywhere.
Where it rose, or whither it rushes,
Immediately, that anguish stooped
Christ will explain each separate anguish
Oh, thou unknown renown
You could not.
   Nodding in navies nevermore.
Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
And like a host, "Come in,"
But just to hear the grace depart
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
Do the buds to them belong?
And situated softly
That any brook is there;
Where every bird is bold to go,
Should reach so small a goal!
THE MONUMENT.
How red their faces grew!
I envy nests of sparrows
Fire exists the first in light,
Vast, in its fading ratio,
That when I could not find it
Pompless no life can pass away;
Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?
   For this was woman's son.
To learn the transport by the pain,
Is mapped, and charted too!
And that 's the skies!
But God on his repealless list
Frequently the woods are pink,
Is Heaven an exchequer?
Of an inland soul to sea, —
The bustle in a house
   A sort they call 'despair;'
Because your face
How many colors taken
A newer Sevres pleases,
   Though pyramids decay,
And carried it to God.
We passed the school where children played,
The stimulus there is
Depreciate the vision;
Then at the feet of the old horizon
Twice have I stood a beggar
I went to thank her,
Except as a surmise,
I know, and they know me;
Stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,
Angels, twice descending,
And of the butterfly
And Mr. Thomson's sheaves.
I held a jewel in my fingers
   This afternoon put on.
I got your letter, and the birds';
It is as if a hundred drums
For her old lover, Don the Sun,
Past the houses, past the headlands,
   It had been heaven below.
An aged bee addressed us,
And then it closes at your feet
Posterior, prophetic,
So spices stimulate the time
Where the meanings are.
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
A bird broke forth and sang,
Also, who leads the docile spheres
And taking but a prayer,
The clouds were gaunt and few;
I must not put my foot amiss
Equilibrium.
   Private like breeze,
You beg him not to go;
There is a shame of nobleness
   Throughout a Christian land.
With badinage divine;
Some vision of the world Cashmere
But somewhere in my soul, I know
In lands I never saw, they say,
I had a daily bliss
Beloved, only afternoon
Poured thee without a stint.
   Before the Christmas tree,
For fear I spoil my shoe?
Yet why so little sound myself
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,
These fleshless lovers met,
Weeds triumphant ranged,
That those who know her, know her less
Computes the stamens in a breath,
I have elected one.
Far safer, of a midnight meeting
One the shutters drew —
Behold, what curious rooms!
Still had it such a value
   For heroes than for men;
As wrecked men deem they sight the land
   Each one of us shall be;
   For duties diamond.
    August, 1891.
   It yet remains to see
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, —
An epicure, a thief, —
Like one in danger; cautious,
Whose bonnets touch the firmament,
I have not quite the strength now
The breaking of the day
And I 'm accustomed to him grown, —
Acres of seams where harvests were,
The robins stand as thick to-day
As housewives do a fly.
I was wont to see,
Sleep is the station grand
Night after night her purple traffic
The dusk drew earlier in,
   Which in the clover dwell.
This being comfort, then
The will of its Inquisitor,
If only centuries delayed,
His name remain.
Then drop the paste,
The privilege.
The one who bore him tottered in,
As wholly as a dew
   So, when she comes this way,
Let him be quick, the viand flits,
And even when it dies, to pass
Is all I own.
This, and my heart, and all the fields,
His larder — terse and militant —
   A whole existence through.
Ah! the sea!
   Or a fife's small fame,
Sent us of the air.
To rejoin its own.
'T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou
That dies away in dimples
Then, turning from them, reverent,
THE BAT.
   The same amounts remain.
Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy, she lived in its presence.
Then, glancing narrow at the wall,
And yet we guessed it not;
   Must thrust the tears away.
I can wade grief,
And newer fashions blow,
'T was a small town,
Angels when the sun is hottest
   And oriole are done!
This is the errand of the eye
And every blossom on the bush
He visited, still flitting;
   Its other realm of sea;
In one or more existences
Taste thine immortal wine!
Would pierce me with a fashion
I found the phrase to every thought
Did stagger pitiful.
And noon should burn,
Antiquest felt at noon
   We fundamental know,
That is the manufacturing spot,
   Or violate a star.
To take the measure of the house.
To races nurtured in the dark; —
   Loving the hand that sent it,
The lady dare not lift her veil
Comprised in prayer.
And then he drank a dew
   How still the dancer lies,
   For Deity.
That stiffens quietly to quartz,
The bat is dun with wrinkled wings
I many times thought peace had come,
Drab habitation of whom?
In casual simplicity.
   Time never did assuage;
   To keep the dark away.
   However good to see,
So civic as the jay.
Velvet people from Vevay,
And set the sun,
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
The emperor will say.
   I, lost, was passing by —
And as oft a cranny
It is not hymn from pulpit read, —
Unto supremest name,
Forgive us, if as days decline,
At any other period.
Stars, amid profound Galaxies,
   Than numb three-score and ten.
It wraps it, rail by rail,
   The day went out to play,
   Have passed beyond the sun,
Retreat was out of hope, —
Clutched tight by greedy hands;
   To call the little child,
   Still it be unfurled.
Soft overheard the whole.
That new grace
Presents a claim invisible,
What service when we pause!
    That soundless tugs within,
Permit a child to join,
I deem that I with but a crumb
And cipher at the sign,
A rush of cochineal;
X.
THE GRASS.
The lungs are stirless, must descend
Contempt of generations,
And God at every gate.
There is a flower that bees prefer,
To meet an antique book,
That just abroad his window
   Some chafe its idle hand;
   If love inquire, 'Where?'
   Gethsemane can tell
Lips unused to thee,
   Surpasses that of wine.
Till when, around a crag,
Still for my missing troubadour
Meant nought but going home.
His idleness a tune;
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,
   As cool to speech as stone,
Bride of the Father and the Son,
[Published in "A Masque of Poets"
She each year leads her daisies back,
By and by the boldest stole out of his covert,
Except to stray abroad
Her needle would not go;
And through a riddle, at the last,
Necromancer, landlord,
   I learned, in leafy wood
   The village lies to-day.
In keen and quivering ratio
And easy sweeps of sky.
Too imperceptible, at last,
Is finished using now,
That whiter host.
'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand
And when I was not heeding
For pang of jealousy.
Than those of organdy,
The sceptic showeth me;
   I gathered from his talk,
   Or a holiday,
A train went through a burial gate,
If such an outcast be,
A print of a vermilion foot;
For yet to buy another pair
Where for the night
How better than a gem!
   That bears a human soul!
The bees will not forget the tune
   And pounds were in the land,
An everywhere of silver,
As Paradise.
And fretted in the eaves.
   And no man visit me,
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn
And prayer,
I dreaded that first robin so,
DISENCHANTMENT.
South winds jostle them,
The East put out a single flag,
   Must not criticise
At last to be identified!
For whom I must decline?
And handled with a chain.
'T is vegetation's juggler,
THE TEST.
Upon my ankle, — then my shoes
Of earl and midge
   That it will come again.
Could keep a chancel cool.
That ever rocked a child.
Then dropped from sight.
Through Calvaries of Love!
The second time to me,
Who hath suffered him.
His knowledge to unfold
And yet it will be done
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
   To make an even sum.
THE SNAKE.
Apparently with no surprise
Some think it service in the place
THE LONELY HOUSE.
Must awaken her.
And clerks in counting-rooms observe,
Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;
It has a simple gravity
The most familiar guest.
   He neutralized them all.
He ate and drank the precious words,
Say, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
   A soul had gone to heaven,
We can find no scar,
By traveller is heard,
On this wondrous sea,
When it goes, 't is like the distance
And turned away, imperial,
I said I gained it, —
Nor vengeance ever comes!
On whose forbidden ear
It sounded as if the streets were running,
   Would it blur the Christmas glee,
   The most accomplished shot!
The earrings of Pizarro
Making that homely and severe,
When Orient has been outgrown,
'T was with text and village singing
There's not a charge to me
Of robins in the trundle bed
Screams chanticleer,
THE BLUE JAY.
THE LOVERS.
And so, when all the time had failed,
And 't was not for me;
Let no pebble smile,
Lapland's necessity.
They died, vitality begun.
   The focus of my prayer, —
How condescending to descend,
If father'd multiply the plates
The crocus stirs her lids,
   Transport, by throe;
Taught me by Time, — the lower way,
If I may have it when it's dead
But she slept;
   We more than half suspect,
That is the break of day.
'T is not conferred by any,
This bird, observing others,
It was a narrow time,
It struck me every day
Brazil? He twirled a button,
   In scholastic skies!
   In a New England town!
PRECEDENCE.
Blazing in gold and quenching in purple,
TWO VOYAGERS.
Be horror's least.
   A function fresh obtain? —
The revery alone will do
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
By catching at the twigs that grow
And then the brake is still.
Or laces, or a travelling show,
SUNSET.
That frightened but an hour.
Surrender is a sort unknown
The reticent volcano keeps
ALONG THE POTOMAC.
I 've heard it in the chillest land,
   And put it in the drawer,
I live with him, I see his face;
The soul with strict economy
Power is only pain,
Come back, and dust the pond!
The patent lost
Exultation is the going
Fled gasping from the house.
How many bullets bearest?
That held the dams had parted hold,
That lit the drummer from the camp
   Our statures touch the skies.
   As if the house were his,
SIMPLICITY.

A fear will urge it where

How long at that celestial wick
   A fashionless delight
Their costume, of a Sunday,

The daily own of Love
I never thought to see,
A narrow fellow in the grass
IN VAIN.
And what itself will say to me,
A PRAYER.
To go and interfere!
How many cups the bee partakes, —

So notelessly are made!
'T is dying, I am doing; but
Till that first shout got by,
In every human soul.
Stop — docile and omnipotent —
And yet with amber hands
Perhaps you 're going too!
Finite to fail, but infinite to venture.
Meadows of majesty concedes
Or service of a keel,
I'm wife; I've finished that,
Acknowledged of the brave, —
An Indiaman — an Earl?
Where two could creep:
And laugh at me, and stare!
When sense from spirit files away,
Italy stands the other side,
'T is that I cannot say;
Is possible
   That gathered these to-day!
Remit as yet no grace,
Not easy to surprise!
Building where schoolboy dare not look
   And badinage partook,
The soul should always stand ajar,
Wades so, through polar air.
One of the ones that Midas touched,
A flying attitude.
   Philosophies don't know,
The distance that the dead have gone
The day that I shall go,
Her public is the noon,
That life like this is endless,
   But came with less of fear,
But holiday excludes the night,
And an orchard for a dome.
Death is the common right
And zero at the bone.
That such a little figure
How would your own begin?
That at the last it should not be
A best disgrace a brave man feels,
We noticed smallest things, —
By fainter hammers, further heard,
The angels, happening that way,
They won't frown always, — some sweet day
One need not be a house;
God made a little gentian;
Is that great water in the west
Conduct the pleasing scene!
Who, had they lived, had died, but when
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
Antiquity.
   With purple load will hang;
   In epauletted white,
Pervaded her, we thought
   For, put them side by side,
That gaze upon his journey;
   I do not understand!
   A good news should be given.
The pretty people in the woods
Was he afraid, or tranquil?
   His eccentricities.
Till sundown crept, a steady tide,
Is the egg of forests
Consented, and was dead.
   Almost to jealousy.
For we must ride to the Judgment,
And ask my business there.
And of the breeze, amen!
Before the fields have finished,
He preached upon "breadth" till it argued him narrow, —
I shall know why, when time is over,
Stands symbol for the finer forge
But the success was his, it seems,
Retire to other latitudes,
   Where the storm is o'er?
I looked at sunrise once,
   Till the houses blot;
All this, and more, if I should tell,
Without a single leaf,
Upon her amber shoe.
I would as soon attempt to warm
And chubby daffodil."
The parlor of the day!
A menace at the sky.
Until the North evoked it.
Through the straight pass of suffering
   Seek it with the knife,
Heavenly hurt it gives us;
   Gave his breath away.
MY CRICKET.
How many legions overcome?
That "Whatsoever you shall ask,
   As if my brain had split;
   So adequate its forms,
Without external sound,
He cheats as he enchants
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush
Bind one, and one will flee.
How the old mountains drip with sunset,
And mice won't bark;
   A soldier's — balls. Who asketh more
To vanquish other blooms.
I'd rather suit my foot
For one must wait
The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
There must be guests in Eden;
Discretion in the interval,
   'T is bliss I cannot weigh,
   Or none perceptible.
    AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,
The "tune is in the tree,"
Her busy foot she plied,
His caravan of red,
A prank nobody knew but them,
November left; then clambered up
Split the lark and you'll find the music,
The parties in both cases
With the blue-birds buccaneering
To make sure all's asleep.
GOSSIP.
In death's stiff stare,
Their height in heaven comforts not,
   To perish of delight.
   Part in memory.
SURRENDER.
And then the windows failed, and then
   When men and women hear
I lost a world the other day.
But his seraphic self!
Where other creatures put their eyes,
   Flit russetly away.
And shut the door unto my house;
How fair her conversation,
Toll, for the bonnie souls, —
Should reach the heart that wanted me;
Spectre cannot harm,
Competent to kill it,
Behind the shelf
Doth of the dew:
When I am occupied.
Hope is a subtle glutton;
Not audible, as ours to us,
Coach it insures, and footmen,
Of clovers and of noon!

XXVIII.
Had been legible to me.
Then prate about "preferment"
   Of his elect content,
It reaches to the fence,
Creation seemed a mighty crack
Keeps esoteric time.
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
And whether, could they choose between,
Without a glance my way:
Land, by the oceans passed;
   Not present on the year
Yet to my frugal eye
Dim as the border star, —
   Wedlock of will decay;
A sudden musket spills.
Salute and pass without a hint —
The rose is out of town.
I boldly answered; entered then
And so, until delirious borne
How public, like a frog
So seemed to choose my door,
By but twelve performed!
Angels' breathless ballot
A WORD.
That went to help the sea.
As laughter was an hour ago,
My soul's at liberty
   Our periods may lie,
My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
Like hindered rubies, or the light
In those dim countries where they go:
The truth never flaunted a sign.
For such the angels go,
As a church remain;
Without a stint, without a blame, —
Apparelled as the new

Was it a pleasant day to die,

The clover-bells forgot.
The waters wrecked the sky,
Who, till they died, did not alive become;
If just as soon as breath is out
It is not fit for table,
   What customs hath the air?
TRANSPLANTED.
Far from love the Heavenly Father
    Than another hue;
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
Time is a test of trouble,
Only the keeper of this seal
Me! Hear! My foreign ear
Nor even of defeat aware
