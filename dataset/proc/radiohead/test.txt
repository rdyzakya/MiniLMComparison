You are my center
Investments and dealers
Just a lie, just a lie
Because I can't do it face to face
Don't hurt me
Proceeded to show it off
Before you've had too much
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
To be trapped in your full stop
Kill me again with love
We know the way you talk,
When sorry is not good enough
Transport, motorways and tramlines
We are one
Guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
And nothin'
I won't turn around at the penny drop
The pillar of my soul
The damage is done
I'm a fish now, out of water
Pale imitation
Get up get the gunge
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Hysterical and useless
Don't question my authority or put me in the box
undo all the ties
What if I just flip-flop?
Feral
Cut a hole (2x)
I'm just
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Concerned, but powerless
I shall now amputate
Get swept under
And true love lives
Come on rain down on me (the dust and the screaming, the yuppies networking)
Starting and then stopping
So let me go upon my way
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Still trapped in your full stop
He said,
I am doing
Of the innocent
I wanna a perfect body
Pull me out of the lake
Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Listen to your heart
Crushed like a bug in the ground
I will eat you alive
Is when you put your lips to these
But it's not
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
You and no-one else
I'd love to set you free
And we're not at the mercy
I feel this often, go
The universe will sigh
Dispossessed, taken host
Walking like giant cranes
Like a house falling in the sea
When I'm not around
I've given all I can
There was no future left at all
Comfortable
I don't really care
Every word, every gesture
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
Believe, believe, believe, believe
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
with a long and winning handsome smile
In red, blue, green
And why should I believe myself, not you
Everyone is so near
Too much
Whatever you want
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
Wake
I keep forgetting
Broken hearts
Kill me, Sarah
The bird lights float into my room
Because you're not there
All your insides fall to pieces
Let this wash all over me
When I see you messing me around?
It's as soft as your pillow
Escape
I don't care if it hurts
But it was just a lie, just a lie
When I'm at the pearly gates
Dead from the neck up
I am born again
But I'm playing with myself?
Mobiles squearking mobiles chirping
A song to keep
I've done wrong
Is the new up
In a jack knifed juggernaut
Black-eyed angels swam with me
Open up your skull
Gather up the lust and soul
They'd shut me away
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
An open ravine
I have no idea what you are talking about
And live for their secrets
To all his new found friends
Where I end and where you start
In a beautiful world
Down is the new up
She screwed me in a vice
Something for the rag and bone man
Patient, patiently
Efil ym fo flaH
two places at once
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I am the key to the lock in your house
For cracks in the pavement
How come I end up where I belong
Killing you
It is now the witching hour
Kill yourself for recognition
see that stretchy smile
You haven't seen it
Never go back
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
A moon shaped pool
And lonely, and lonely?
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
Wakey wakey
Alright
Singing I miss you
I'm the next act
It's what you feel now
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
And now I'll set you free
In the eye of the Beholder
And sailed on shooting stars
And innocent
If I just turn and run
Iron lung
Take a look around,
What it is
Do what we want
Don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
We escape
You do it to yourself, whoa
The water's clear
Put me inside
Before you're comatose
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
This is my way of saying goodbye
But I'm still no one, and you're now a star
That's not me
You can be frightened
You just ain't got the message yet
We are
He used to do surgery
Dedicated to all human beings
Appliances have gone berserk
Faith, you're driving me away
I'll dress like your niece
I can watch and not take part
'Cause I'm not
What you ought to
You really me
You reel me out then you cut the string
I'll take a quiet life
My final bellyache
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
All on candid camera
You'll go to Hell
Climbing up the walls
As my world
The one who broke the seal
Nervous messed up marionettes
Truth will mess you up
You'll be the one screaming out
One I didn't know
The darkness is beneath
Been thinking about you
Took my melody
Yeah
Picking up every last crumb
Your tiny hands
Nothing at all
We don't want the loonies taking over
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
Strike up what's in the box
I'm lost, I'm a ghost
Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy
You really messed up
This machine will, will not communicate
Turning in somersaults
And it wears me out
The river running dry
When I need you
I'm not living,
I get eaten by the worms
That there
My blood will thicken
So why does it still hurt?
Yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
And once it's over
They brought in the C.I.A
Sing a song on the jukebox that goes
And teach you how to get to purest hell
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
But it got edited, fucked up
Come on and let it out
Of your shimmerers or spells
Let down
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
What the hell am I doing here?
The numbers don't decide
And now I know it's never gonna be oh me
Don't blow your mind with whys
In a bunker
There's an empty space inside my heart
You do it to yourself
I did it for a reason
falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
You eye each other as you pass
Should put me down
A spineless laugh
And I have it all here
This is the gloaming
There there
Do not react
We don't really want a monster taking over
You're just like an angel
Are not required
(It's what keeps me alive)
it's like i've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
No matter what happens now
We hope your
Rain down, rain down (that's it, sir, you're leaving, the crackle of pigskin)
We're too young to fall asleep
I can't do this
Give Up The Ghost
I might be wrong
My fake plastic love
They love me like I was their brother
Spectre has come for me
We would shrink and then be quiet as mice
Pack
Bring down the government
Baby's got the bends
Arrest this girl
Of all these weird creatures
Nothing.
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
And as that woman blows her cover
The big fish eat the little ones
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Out of sight and out of mind, lonely
I'm ready,
Maybe not
They protect me
Drill holes in themselves
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
Well, come and break the door down
Making home movies
[Backing vocals]
I'll be dancing
What seems impossible
I live in a town
Just to fill your fast ballooning head
If you could take it all back again
Just 'cause you feel it
All the time
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
You float like a feather
For a minute there
I can see you drowning
But I'm not
You can try the best you can?
In an interstellar burst
Wish that I could come out of the fog
She lives with a broken man
Kicks you in the teeth
You
Made me happy
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
Take me back
Like ripples on a blank shore
Where are you now?
Jigsaws falling into place
I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
Trapped in your parked car
in a bunch of flowers
But I can't help the feeling
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
Two jumps in a week
The good times
Obligations
There's no use dwelling on,
In your darkest hour
Still there is no point letting it go to waste
Look into my mouth
