No harm
Morning Mr. Magpie
Freaking out
Little by little by hook or by crook
Steel toe caps
The only truth that I can see
But gravity always wins
roll onto the earth
You can try the best you can
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
An airbag saved my life
You used to be alright
I used to think
How come I end up where I started
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
Now come home
You want me?
You crawled off and left us
To the other side
Invisible
I feel my luck could change
January has April showers
Such a chill
The touch is like a breeze
And I can't face the evening straight
A green plastic watering can
If you try the best you can
Lying in the leaves
Sprawling on a pin,
As lotus flowers
You've gone off the rails
Step into the fog
lift us on the wind
The words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Yeah I feel it, I needed attention
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
Heaven sent you to me
Flying on your motorcycle
Is crawling out upon, expelling
This dance
No longer wound up like a spring
Before your father hears us
Are you and I could never run away from you
I sat in the cupboard
Living on animal farm
Hid back under
It's gone
A universal sigh
This is killing me
It must have got mixed up
Tiptoe around, tie him down
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
There's always a siren
The best you can is good enough
In my spirit light
Pour yourself a hot bath
Back and hide
Lotus Flower
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
I'm played out and bleed to please you
I never really got there
I've got the smell of a local man
And cut me up
Oh, oh
God loves his childrean
Now self-employed
You stole it all
That you choose to ignore
Open on all channels
Like the parting of the waves
Get the eggs
I'd be crazy not to follow
Have ourselves a good time
Alone on an airplane
Is you do it to yourself just you
Please don't interrupt
All my past and futures
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
you just say the word, apparition comes
And teach you how to be a holy cow
All blurring into one
Listen to me
Open up, let me in
Yeah I love it, the attention
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Don't you dare
Just don't leave
I'm not coming back
I don't know why I
It wears him out
What is was you tried to say
It's always better on the outside
The birds
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Of self defense
But you don't
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
A moon full of stars and astral cars
This is a low flying panic attack
My brain says I'm receiving pain
Yeah it's gone
I needed attention
You try to get off the hook.
Avoid all eye contact
Phew, for a minute there
I go
So dark
In haunted attics
When you were here before
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Cold wives and Sunday papers city
The emptiest of feelings
More productive
Such a pretty house
You try at working out chaotic things
They should be ringing
They don't, they don't speak for us
Why don't you remember my name?
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
In a fast German car
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Exactly where do you get off
He's like a detuned radio
Ah ah ah (oh oh oh)
Codex
A foul tasting medicine
Flying to our side
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Now you feel it you don't
Find yourself a ????,
Kid A, kid A
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
Floor collapsing, falling
Karma police
She ate me up for breakfast
Fodder for the animals
Through
It wears me out
Just as you write my number down
All hell
In duplicate and duplicate
Floating upon the surface for the birds?, the birds?, the birds?
Doesn't mean it's there
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive
The chink in your armour
Fall off the table
That either way he turns
When the walls bend
I would shrink and I would disappear
Gather up the lost and sold (don't hurt me)
I fell open, I lay under
One for yes
You've changed the locks three times
She looks back, you look back
It's such a beautiful day.
Pass it on
Ah
That wasn't my intention
Against the present
I sail to the moon
And get swept under
To another life
And fill up with noise
Her Hitler hairdo
These rumors and suspicion
Dirty mind is thinking
I've been waiting
But you can take it all back again
Floating around on a prison ship
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
They got scared and they put me in
Oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
I'm talking to you after it's too late
Hysterical and (you know where you are)
Hysterical and
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Genie let out the bottle
Scream as they fight for life
I just want to be your lover
We are standing on the edge
Anger is a poison
And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
Did the cat get your tongue
No great job, no message coming in
Like a cat
You want me, well fucking come and find me.
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
I follow to the edge of the earth
This this is our new song
Am I really sinking
It's gonna be a glorious day
I could blow through the ceiling
And I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
Oh, no
In your arms (don't hurt me)
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
Keep it moving
Snakes and ladders flip the lid
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Start again begin again
In your arms
It comes to us all
It is too late now
We're not scaremongering
Mistakes mistaken
A job that slowly kills you
Is like a weapon
Without a safety net
Follow where you lead
But the music's all wrong
Blame it on the black star
Where the sun comes
Has been in vain
To my children
I would slip into the groove
What's that?
You've got a Cheshire cat grin
It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh
That there's nothing underneath
Too powerful
Let's go down the waterfall
Burst out of the sand
Who's in a bunker, who's in a bunker?
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
You can be, it's okay
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?
Fuckin' come and break the door down
Buy another ticket
He talks in maths
And if you float you burn
Sit in the back while no-one drives
Who just wants to share your light
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
I am such a tease, and you're such a flirt
I stop from falling
And you're so small
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat
Trying to get yourself away.
I want to be part of the human race, race, race?
For what your
You don't wanna say the words,
You watch your feet
She looks like the real thing
Ready to receive
Tied to a stick
Caught in the fire
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
What are we coming to?
From a great height
And there's nowhere to hide
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
Fingers in the blackbird pie
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell
down the cable lines
This will be on my videotape, my videotape
Bouncing back and one day, I am gonna grow wings
Wings twitch, legs are going
Gave me sunshine
Scrolling up and down
And how much did it cost
Just as the drinks arrive
Where the weeds take root
Lord and Lady blah blah, the vicar and the judge
Now
When I'm playing with myself?
Forget about your house of cards
Loose talk around tables
A spectre of my mortal soul
Keep breathing
There's
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And I'll do mine
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would-
I'm moving out of orbit
Waiting to happen
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
You can scream and you can shout
You know, you know where you are with
Is making me feel ill
I float down the Liffey
Tried to say
Feel so tongue tied
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
Slight of hand
What is up, buttercup?
And he's reaching up to grab me
It is the 21st century
This slow
You and your cronies
Little By Little
They never learn
A chemical reaction
Come on if you think
'Cause I'd be scared
Red crosses on wooden doors
One two three four
The sky turns green
This is a round up
But now I see you messing me around
No matter how it ends
I won't slack off
All my lovers were there with me
Used as a photo in Time magazine
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
Eyes, eyes, eyes
On videotape
It's holding on
I jumped in the river, what did I see?
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
You run to the back and you cover your ears
When it comes it's so, so, disappointing
Fifteen steps
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
And all the figures I used to see
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Oh hail to the thief
Shoot the messengers
Don't get heavy
Fireworks and hurricanes
Separator
Treading on people's toes
I shall now contort
This is really happening happening
Dancing for your pleasure
The wind rushing round my open heart
I jumped into the river
At the tea parlour
The wings of a butterfly
I wanna have control
And in your life, there comes a darkness
When I spin away
Funny ha ha funny how
Singing you to shipwreck
She says she'd love to come help but
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
Say, hey
In my spirit white
Us a song
I'm in the middle of your picture
Gather up the pitiful (don't hurt me)
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
The one who broke the spell
wish we could connect
What seems impossible (don't hurt me)
I'll be waiting, with a gun and a pack of sandwiches and nothing, nothing, nothing.
This one's optimistic
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
Your alarm bells
And while the cat is away
A total waste of time
And wash your swollen feet
Futures tricked by the past
You and whose army?
You can take us on
Taking off and landing
And heads down a mountain
Slowly we unfold
Superhero powers
We'd be a walking disaster
Too bright
This is how I end up sucked in
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Open your mouth wide
Mmmhm
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Rise and shine
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Fear puts a spell on us
But I'd be alright
I will shrink and I will disappear
Something big is gonna happen
In a town full of rubber plans
Mephistopheles is just beneath
X will mark the place
This is my final fit
She tastes like the real thing
Couldn't look you in the eye
I won't let this happen
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Don't leave me dry
go
There are two colors in my head
She's running out
There's no real reason
And you can't offer me escape
Where you, you left me alone
Put him in the pot
You do it to yourself, you do
I'm curling with my love
Who bought you cigarettes,
The breath of the morning
You bit me, bit me and I want more
You do it to yourself you do
What would I do?
Deaf, dumb, and blind
God loves his children, yeah
taste the air with you
Take me back home again
Is enough is enough is enough
No use dwelling on.
I wish I was special
I'm not here
Because there are no others
Glassy eyed light of day
Oh
Before you take my mic
They're not gonna happen
And you may pour us away like soup
I'll drown my beliefs
Comes like a comet
You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I promise to be good
Before the animal noises
Not my problem, give me some
And such a pretty garden
And I can't, and I can't come down
The last one out of the box
In pitch dark
Her answer-phone
And there'll be no more lies
Burn the witch
They will suck you down
But she's out with
You messed up everything
Watch me fall
Closed circuit cameras
No matter how it starts
I've my heart in my mouth
I'm an animal
Shake your pockets out
Silent, silent
Cheer at the gallows
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free
Just happy to serve
Get towed by the worms
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
I lost myself, I lost myself
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
All the fish swim down too deep lonely
In the fake plastic earth
Bruises that won't heal
What you ought to, what you ought to
Everything
Today
just to see what if
A handshake of carbon monoxide
What happened?
Run
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
Take it with a pinch of salt
Meet the real-world coming
When you mess with us
Squash his head
Topsy turvy town
From a thousand years of sleep
The grass grows over me
Take me with yer
If I did not have you?
Just to see what if
But we're still on the payroll
You broke another mirror
Your future's bleak
It holds us like a phantom
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
I'm on a roll
So lock the kids up safe tonight
She's running out again,
It's all right
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
Tiptoe around, tie them down
'Cause I'm your superhero
When I am king, you will be first against the wall
I'm trying to get some rest
For no real reason
You really messed up this time (ah)
Give it back
Boys in first class don't know we're born just know
You got some nerve coming here
I am the pick in the ice
I don't belong here
You are all I need
The drying of
I am holidays
Come on rain down on me
Once you've been around you've been around enough
See the moon smiling
Calls me on the phone
Dragging out the dead
Did your string come undone
But no, no, no
Here I'm alive
I got the poison, poison and now I want more
In the next world war
But we all like stars
Sandbag and hide
And where are you?
I would shape myself into your pocket
With your breathing
No alarms and no surprises
Will be in vain
Yeah, I got the poison
One day at a time
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
- instrumental --
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
You paint yourself white
Plastic bags and
Pour yourself a drink
Dancing clothes won't let me in
We are accidents waiting
Throw your keys in the bowl
Nothing so childish
And in your life, there comes the darkness
Like diamonds in the dust
You're turning into something you are not
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
That we can create, that we can create
The smell of the warm summer air
Won't you be my girl?
And I'm not here
Ghost horses
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
You try to get off the hook,
All the good times
Do what you want
I won't get heavy
Your face in the glass, and it's dark now
Don't haunt me
Get yourself together
All these things into position
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
And get dressed
Come on, rain down on me
Totally alive
Not drinking too much
Voltage spikes
Has the light gone out for you?
I want to be part of the human race
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
At ease
Totally released
Do it to yourself
The walls abandon shape
Where you can't smell a thing
We'll take back what is ours
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Snot-nosed little punk
(A giant turtle's eyes)
As jellyfish float by
wish that I could flip one of those lies
You forget so easily
In everlasting peace
The path trails off
The sea would
If I could be who you wanted
I love you but enough is enough, enough
You know what I mean
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
I'm gonna melt down
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
blend into the light
And cut me off
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
On lollipops and crisps
I just don't know anymore
Complications
Denial, denial
Is you do it to yourself, just you
And are you on the list?
You know we're friends till we die
Holding half a head
Trying to get yourself away,
Etcetera etcetera
One day I'll get to you
We don't have any real friends
You can't take it with yer
This one dropped a payload
You are not to blame for
Where do we go from here?
No, no, no
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
And jellyfish float by
Waiting in the wings
Your ears should be burning
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
You are the sun the moon and stars
Electrocute us all
And the path trails off
Nice dream
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
You know you should
D-don't leave me high
Out pops the cracker
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
There is no way out
Your crazy-kitten smile
All the lies run around my face
Like with myxomatosis
You can fight it like a dog
Well what am I to do?
Wears him out
This dread still covers us
Come on, come on
To have you be in peace
This isn't happening
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A white room
The words are coming out all weird
Your skin makes me cry
Women and children first and the children first and the children
To blow me sky-high
If you take me there you'll get relief
I been where I liked
Just as they play your favorite song
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
They're the ones who'll hate you
I lost your number
He still comes reeling through the door
Sing
Really mess
Trying to get out of the night
Aliens hover
Before the night owl
And while the ocean blooms
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
Been thinking about you, your records are here
Yeah I need it, I needed attention
But when I see you messing me around
I want you to notice
What do you care when I'm not there?
It's the best thing that you ever had
And we have crashed her party
Vultures circling the dead
You know where you are with
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
Takes all your credit cards
Sawn off
Just like the last one
If you stare into the dark the dark will stare back
Don't leave
Make a sound
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
It wears her out
I'll swallow up flies?
Weird fishes
I'm gonna go to sleep
That there's a way out
Before you start unraveling
Cheering and waving
With white elephants
So now I set you free
Car wash, also on sundays
Just as you take my hand
Hit the bottom and escape
Take the money run take the money run take the money
As the magic disappears
He's been hanging around for days
Ladies and gentlemen
Cease this endless chattering
How are we today?
Two for no
Sleight of hand
She's run run run run
He's not coming back
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
And all you have to do is say yeah
I just got off the train
Your tears
In rainbows
Waking, waking up from shutdown
Steer away from these rocks
And this is my chance
The best thing you have had is gone away
Drag him out your window
To me, to me?
I want to see you smile again
Routines and schedules
Before you run away from me
I am up in the clouds
Your system is a lie
No alarms and no surprises, please
The dinosaurs roam the earth
Fade out again
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
Catch the mouse
Go up to the mic,
I do not
Beyond the point
Where I please
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Over my dead body
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
Yeah no one likes a smart arse
I wanna a perfect soul
(And jellyfish float by)
His blood is frozen
I'm just killing time
And they brought me to my knees
Breaks loose
Fantasize
Even at this angle
Yeah you, you know what I mean
Now as I go upon my way
What are we gonna do?
Off with his head, man
Slowly we unfurl
Whatever makes you happy
And took my memory
Because we separate
Please could you stop the noise
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Down a mine
Come back and focus again
But know right from wrong
I want to live, breathe
I got myxomatosis
Who just crumbles and burns
Oh oh oh
Keep it light and
You're so fuckin' special
We hope
Don't look in the mirror at the face you don't recognize
Just think of all the fun,
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Where I end and you begin
Panic is coming on strong
I think I have had my fill (don't hurt me)
And why should I believe myself?
Just exactly as I remember
In its right place
Words are a sawed off shotgun
Turned so nasty now
Rain down, rain down
It shines its understanding
Like domino's
I think I should give up the ghost (don't hurt me)
And catching my reflection in a window
Payin' attention
Chief of Police or Vice Chancellor
My hunger burns a bullet hole
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
Soon oh
You could be having.
Gather up the pitiful
In you I'm lost
The road you should have took,
I'm just an insect
Before
Born and raised for the job
There's candles on the cake,
Honey, come to me before it's too late
With the edges
I spoke too soon
If you had another one
And now that you found it
People have this power
The day the banks collapse on us
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
We call upon the people
Breathe
And fall off
In a little while
Strangled beaten up
I will slip into the groove and cut me off
That she bought from a rubber man
A good memory
This one just came out of the swamp
I didn't care but now I can see
We are loosing it, can't you tell?
Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
I want to
In pretty patterns
The head of state has called for me by name
One day he'll get to you
Sail us to the moon
And if I could be who you wanted
You really messed up this time
A cracked polystyrene man
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
Beyond me
Someone on your shoulder)
Good morning Mr. Magpie
Nothing's gonna happen without warning
A lack of oxygen from my life support
Uptight
It's all wrong
You do it everyday
And if you get too far inside
It's like the world is gonna end so soon
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We are not the same as you
Why should I stay here?
I'm on a roll this time
Everyone
Face
What do you care?
Out of control on videotape
This is a foul tasting medicine
Shove it in your mouth
Full of holes
And fade out again and fade out
Why should you care when I'm not there?
Come slowly to me
You want me, fucking come on and break the door down.
Knives you in the neck
Blame it on the falling sky
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Kill yourself to never ever stop
Right place
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
Don't leave me high
Hey it's me
I'm ready.
And true love waits
Just to see what is
(The first of the children)
A job that's killing you
The bangers in the mash, the negatives for cash
Rules and wisdom choke you
You left me alone
Up above
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
It's what keeps me alive
Take a bow take a bow take a bow
a hole (2x).
Holy Roman empire
Shadows blue and red
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
So now I'll set you free
Strangled, beaten up
In the neon sign
Then a shear drop
To the shadows blue and red
I'll be there
The poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
It's not enough
No chance of escape
Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
In the deepest ocean
This is one for the good days
In the sea
I slept with who I liked
Across a street
Back into your soul
Smacks you in the head
And it's too late
I think I have had my fill
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Are you such a dreamer
Oh Maria, come slowly
One day, I am gonna grow wings
Or in the flood
To her we do return
There's a gap where we meet
Bloom
You're all dancing to my little red book
What am I coming to?
It's the devil's way now
The dark's there
You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
It's on again, off again, on again
Just sit back and listen
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know
Take it with the love its given
A last stop
Blink your eyes
Why should I stay?
Slide your hand
Don't loose
Always second-guessing love
The future is inside us
Immerse your soul in love
On what might have been,
Be president
They're the once who'll spit at you
Never living earnest, never get judged
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
I'm alright
What's the point of instruments
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
Wake me up
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
Fuckin' well, come and find me
Won't stop now
This place is on a mission
This is what you'll get
Move back home
Have they all got the bends?
So knives out
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
Can't get the stink off
That keeps your toys in the basement
By a window
Turn me on to phantoms
You should put me in a home or you
Maybe you'll
It's always best when the light is off
We know where you live
A frightening place
Pass it down
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Cut him up
No one gets hurt
Still kisses with saliva
There'll be something missing
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey
Reckoner
Someone's son or someone's daughter
One by one
They're all
Bittersweet distractors
And I'm sorry for us
Crawling out upon, expending
I'd really like to help you, man
Of no return
Oh, oh, oh
Everyone around here
(One day at a time)
Fitter, happier
I'll swallow till I burst
My baby's got the bends
You're so last week
They dug me my very own garden
I want you to know
Rise up
They don't know what I know
Everybody leaves
No one around
Twitching and salivating
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
I bet you really miss me
So why does this still hurt?
Now you've stolen all the magic
They turn me
In a deep, deep sleep
I'm alive
I keep the wolf from the door
Lay me down
With no alarms and no surprises
You shouldn't be afraid
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
In a tight little world
There'll be no more lies
Your eyes
I'll lay down the tracks
Who lock up their spirits
Trip me as I speak
You don't wanna talk to me,
Get the flan in the face
Floatin' upon this surface for the birds
We ride tonight
Too cynical to speak
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
I just wanna talk
You don't remember
I will shape myself into your pocket
I'll be gone
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
(Turning in somersaults)
That's driven into
Spectre, how he laughs
And it wears him out
I need to wash myself again
I'll set you free
The bottom of the sea
This goes
Until I burst until I
of the diving board
No longer empty and frantic
Abandon all reason
I don't know where it is I should look
Check for pulse
Go and get some rest.
The mongrel cat came home
Kiss your husband goodnight
Where two and two always makes a five
Jump off the end
Less chance of illness
Their faces are concrete grey
From a great height (the panic, the vomit, the panic, the vomit)
Before you're lost between the noise
Cold wives and mistresses
Because down is the new up
Or all this love
The infrastructure will collapse
All the birds stay up in the trees
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
There is nothing to explain
A giant turtle's eyes
Don't get any big ideas
Arrest this man
Little baby's eyes
To put the world to rights
You will be the one who cannot talk
Let the light pour in
Wish away the nightmare
I'm taking you down when I go down
Broken hearts make it rain
Hanging off the hook,
Still cries at a good film
I wish you'd get up get over
And so we crumble
I'll be waitin'
Your nerve
Why so green and lonely?
Who's in a bunker who's in a bunker?
You think you drive me crazy
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Take back what is ours
What you really wanted.
The bird that's flown into my room
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Falling asleep against the windowpane
I will
Facts for whatever
But he calls me up
Come back
So cold, from the inside out
I am back to save the universe
Ah, ah
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Throw it in the fire throw it in the fire throw it on the
Take me back again
The truth will mess you up
I think I should give up the ghost
I want to, I want to be someone else or I'll explode.
You want me, well come on and break the door down.
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
Think about the good times and never go back
Take me on board their beautiful ship
It's nothing at all
It's such a beautiful day,
All the things you need
Everything all of the time
My iron lung
I can feel their blue hands touching me
Your shimmerers or spells
Red, blue, green
But I don't have time for him
If you'd been a dog
And wrote it down in neat
And that's what really hurts
And if I'm gonna talk
Stay in the shadows
I twitch and salivate
The ones you light your fires to keep away
A patient, better driver
Understand
A heart that's full up like a landfill
Toilet trained and dumb
Before we all go under
Don't look down
What is that you tried to say
You can laugh
I walk through walls
This one went to market
Broken branches
Split infinite
All the things you got,
We hope that you choke
If you had another name
Reasonable and sensible
I'm amazed that I survived
So glad, so glad you're mine
Flies are buzzing round my head
I have seen too much I haven't seen enough
It's no one's business but mine
You've done nothing wrong
Through an open doorway
We are of the earth
You look so tired, unhappy
All the things you got
And two and two always makes a five
'Cause the light's gone for me
You'll only see my reflection
Houses move and houses speak
You could want it all, the flag and pole
Duplicate and triplicate
Not just once
I don't want to be your friend
I cannot keep up
(4, 5, 6, 7)
Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
Dare not speak its name
Now we're trapped, we're dark cloud's people
So don't get any big ideas
I try to sing along
It's whatever you say it is
The present tense
I call up my friend the good angel
Who's got the loneliest feeling
Let me hear both sides let me hear both sides let me hear both
Someone always does
Out of your shell
Suckered you but not your friends
I don't belong here.
Moonbeam
But now
It's too much
I have no idea what I am talking about
We are helpless to resist
The beat goes round and round
I'm tingling tingling tingling
(Someone on your shoulder
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
And either way you turn
Don't blow your mind with why
To get rid of itself
Born of a light
He buzzes like a fridge
We scratch our eternal itch
Rows and rows of enemies
I guess he does
Right across your
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I can't kick your habit
Murderers you're murderers
Not just twice
If they get the chance
Switching on a light
I'll stay home forever
Why should I be good if you're not?
Take it to the tax man
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
When the power runs out we'll just hum
If you're frightened
Will not cry in public
Pull me out of the aircrash
I go walking in your landscape
There's a gap in between
An elephant thats in the room is
And for anyone else to see
reforming on the wind
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
I only stick with you
Underground
The moment's already passed
And fade out again and fade out again
Sitting ducks
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
I was dropped from
Let down and hanging around
Comes crashing down
You gotta be kidding me
And who are my real friends
I'll hit the bottom
From your sleep
You'll build an Ark
Ice age coming ice age coming
Get up get over and turn the tape off
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour
They would have drowned you at birth
Be a world child, form a circle
Late at night when I'm driving
It's not somewhere else
Just dragonflies
I just pretended that I had
the sweetest flowers and fruits were hanging from the trees
You really messed up everything
I've seen it coming
Fifteen blows to your mind
Beyond you
Alone
And they pray
Now I see you messing me around
And sail us to the moon
I'm ready
From a great height, height
They were cheering and waving
I dance around the pit
Into a clear lake
Your services
Still turning heads, you know where it's at
That you'll never need
We know what you want,
For girls in the eighties
We thought you had it in you
Nothin'
The best thing you ever, ever had
That you choke
The flan in the face
No paranoia
I am a moth
Everyone has got the fear
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Like everything is fine
Dreamers
Drying up in conversation
Ah ah ah
You, me, and everything
Let me back
To hide all the dirt and pain
Us warm
For the folks back home
Don't you flan in the face
