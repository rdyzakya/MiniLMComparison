Sex - it's not that type of party
There's no place I'd rather be
And danced upon the heads
I'm waiting for that love

Everybody wants to find the perfect 1
In the dark
Just say the word and I'll strip
Say hey hey hey (hey hey hey)

And time spent alone my friend, will cease
Everyone should come and dig Christopher Tracy's piano

And you said, "I must confess,
Your love is driving me...

The thought of his tongue in the V of her love
Someone that makes u happy, someone that makes u laugh when u want 2 cry

Can I see it, baby? (Mmm) Ow!
Just thinkin' about all we could do

But her kingdom never comes, thy will be done
All things will be fine
Why settle 4 a star when u can have the sun?
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
Everytime somebody broke your heart
Don't sleep 'til the sunrise, listen 2 the falling rain
Do U wanna make me cry?
I know I could be nasty with u

Through generations,
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely

If ya listen close u 'bout to learn a lesson
Artists young and old
In my cauldron. That means my nugget...
The angel on my shoulder starts coaching
If we bathe in each other's hips
What's this strange relationship that we hold on 2?
Joy, joy (love me) in repetition,
(good god)
A little bit harder than they did in '66
When they tell me 2 walk a straight line
All in life becomes easier,
Still would stand all hate around us
Hey (A-U-T-O-matic)
Or would U rather dine alone?
(I'm gonna drive U crazy)
And my lips just drip
Bet U got a body, by God
And everyday the feeling gets stronger
Say it 1 more time
U can dance if U want 2 - All the critics love U in New York
Shut up already, damn!
I mean it's a sticky situation
(all time)
But before a "no" was even said
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
They completely lost their way
Praise me, craze me
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life (U are my saviour)
And now I'm just as blue as I can be
I wondered if I had enough class
But I cry when we're apart, yeah
Everybody,
So sue me if I go 2 fast
S 2 the S
Let's get hyped y'all. Release it.
Come here, where U goin'?
Terminal condition of the heart
It's like being on death row (In the dark)
Must be something in the water U drink
Because I hate U (I hate U)
Shake! Shake. U gotta shake something.
The love that comes from a warm heart in a cold cold world
Is it really important where I take my naps? (no)
Like a horny pony would (Put your love down)
U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head (baby, baby)
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright
Waiting for the love to come around
Gotta gotta gotta go!
People, people, whatever floats this joker's boat
I took U 4 a ride and baby I'm sorry
All your lovers - they look just like you
without a shot of new spunk (Ha)
Uno para todos, y todos para uno [One 4 all and all 4 one]
Detroit - what's happenin'?
Everybody, everybody jump up and down
Up the back of a pack of rats
Shake it like you just don't care (Shake it like you just don't care)
Everybody, everybody knows
Cocaine was the thing that I took on

That's right. (that's what I'm talkin' about)
maybe we can stay in touch
And then the band say
I think I wanna dance
I can't hold back
Love me, Love me, joy, joy, joy in repetition
If I came back as a dolphin
Shucks
I'll jack u off
U are fine (Fine)
U made love 2 me
Take my hand, it'll be alright
"'Till my life is through"
So lonely, baby
I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Commitment..
Who made funny faces just like
Oops, then there goes your clout
She says conversation's better than being lonely
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah (We gotta break it on down, down, down)
Electric chair
When I was your man?
(I remember how U kissed me)
I ain't got no money
Live music from a band plays a song called "Soul Psychodelicide".
That army bag
Maybe we can stay in touch
Dance girl - lemme see the booty boom
There is nothing that will overcome the love we share
Ready 2 whisper (whisper, whatcha say)
2 help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Somebody told him playin' cops and robbers was cool
To find that love to call my own
This ain't about the booty movin' pumpin' the max
Don't my kisses please u right
'Cause I'm so alone
Give what you can, all you can stand, and all of your life will be made
Pumpin' the big noise in the 90's.
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop (Check the record, yeah!)
But that's alright, (that's alright)
Giddy up
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
Get me outta here - I feel I'm gonna die
On a watered-down tip
[Missile..Internal..]
All the non-believers better fear me
Ready 2 shout (shout, now whatcha say)
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
U, I want U.
I like it
There comes a road in every man's journey (don't be afraid)
I never known a love so sweet
If we never heard about the evils that those before us committed
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
Love can save us all
(Who U callin' ho bitch? Black ho bitch!)
Should we go on livin' together
I was here long before U (Melody, long before u)
I want you now, I just can't wait no more
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
Oh baby, I can't get you outta my head
The other brothers buggin' and this is 4 those who oppose
What U wantin' 2 say? (Get funky)
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
C'mon baby
And believe it or not, all the troubles u forgot
Now we clarify 4ever, in other words as long as it takes
Will make everything go wrong
la la la
I'll be standing naked with nothing but a smile on
You done me wrong
Love will conquer if u just believe (Oh yeah)
You parked your car sideways that it wouldn't last
Wait a minute. Let me turn on some lights. we can funk.
Why can't I fly away in a special sky?
Party people - say it now: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
Alpha 7, acknowledge
Give us this day our daily bread
Sometimes you play the part
Everybody's looking 4 that ladder (Everybody's looking 4 the ladder)
Love of my love (love of my love)
Let me take a bite
When I say that I'm in love mama (mama, mama)
Forever, forever, baby I want U forever
(We are all a star)
Anything is better than the picture of the child
Aahhh Cindy C, (What's it gonna be?)
We gettin' international
(Maybe we can stay in touch)
Only I know, only I know, baby, what turns you on
Question:
And give it this much affection
Love if u're there come save me
Just a steady wishin' that he was who you are
Cause I want u
They all know the words but the music is doomed
I don't know. Party people in the crib get hyped. (yeah)
What if I filled your eyes with tears
Then listen -
(3 chains o' gold)
Got my body hot
So fair she looked tonight,
Get it up
I love U
Therein, my virgin, love's wine
Say one thing, do another, it's time
Now that I'm willin', it's a fact
If U can't find a better reason 2 call this woman otherwise
Til you're burning up
It'd take forever to get you off my mind
Call your next of kin, cuz your ass is gone
Oh girl, where'd U get those shoes?
Ha, Germany, Paris France - we gettin' stupid
Everybodys looking 4 love
Drippin' all over the floor, the floor
You just gonna sit there and watch?
Tonight your a star
Peace and be wild (Aaah, Pussy Control)
Heavy on our minds (we sacrifice)
The only time U go
How can you do this to me
Tell me what U think of me
Let' go
I've been searching 4 a lover
And then my backbone slips (I wanna melt with u)
Kiss away
Would our rap have been different if we only knew?
U were so hard 2 find
You don't have to be cool
Let's stop fooling around
I bet u thought the lights were on but noone's living there
Tell me that U love me girl
Like a flame she came and I was no longer cold
But when I woke up this mornin'
U should do that girl
How I suffer from the heat
No one that I've ever, knows how 2 handle my body
Turn around again
Set your mind free
Confusion!
Then give me the electric chair
I had everything I needed
There ain't never been a cleaner girl in the whole wide world
If I gave u diamonds and pearls (Diamonds)
Wave your hand in the air (oh daddy)
The only thing that's in our way is u.
Now that I've got your attention
Peace (Daddy Pop) (oh daddy)
I do love U. I do.
My sister was burnin' to love me and loose
Do it to you right
U, yeah.
Baby, I gotcha where I wantcha,
(yeah) release it.
If you're out there, baby, please come to me
Thank U so much
I'm lookin' 4 a PhD
... it sure don't matter 2 night
Giving up so easy
So they put their babies together 2 eliminate the fear
There were people runnin' everywhere
And together we'll stare into silence
Some people wanna die
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Is that all your gold?
Boy, U better act like U understand
Lose all self-control, baby just can't steer
I really get a dirty mind (mind, mind, mind...)
And love, it isn't love until it's past
Bring 2 life a vision in one's mind
You just leave it all up to me
Pheromone, (Pheromone) controllin' my every motion
Hey whoop it up y'all
Help me (aaww shit)
In other words - its R.E.A.L meaning of this thing called love
La, la, la, la
When we be makin' love
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)
When the fire blows
Okay, what are you gonna do
Sexuality is all we ever need
I don't wanna hear U scream (Don't wanna hear U scream)
And this 1- ooh! Yeah - That's the 1.
On the floor
(Paris, say it once more time, uh!)
Music is the key 2 set yourself free
I want 2 see the booty boom before I even let
Unless it's got that pop
I said "Momma chill out, (push)
Papa said "Yeah, I know, that's what this here's 4"
It happens all the time
The steps U take are no easy road
Tell me what 2 do babe (A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with U)
All is what were marchin' 4 (Whooaa)
Cuz I'm dead (on it, on it, on it)
Who's gonna stop 200 balloons?
More than your brother
A friend of mine, he got killed and in retaliation
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
2 see if u're ripe
(Sex) Sex between 2 people is alright
I'm yours
Tell me, what's the matter with your world
'Cuz I don't wanna blow it
Not state-side
He pulls a gat
Solo, solo...
If U're 18 and over, come here
The ride up front is better when U've been in the back
Pero antes un mensaje de nuestros auspiciadores
Let's get the hell out of here.
I pray that when U dream, U dream of how we kissed
Bang.
My funk will leave ya dead cause it's good and plenty dope
I took a chance
That's when I break a back
(Do that, do that, somebody)
We are all a star
We don't let society
Never have I wanted to till now
Ooh, R u sure baby? R u sure (La la la la la la)
Don't try to play me 4 yesterday's fool
Pardon me 4 thinking, but there's something under my hair
Keep goin'
When I reach my destination (we sacrifice)
I barely have enough money for two
{Out on my block I'm just a loner} (we sacrifice)
Ooh Papa...
Dear Dad,
If you feel all right lemme hear you scream
Yeah hit it, it's time to get with it, huh
Come 2 the park
And your feel will be sweet 2 me
Superfunkycalifragisexy (woah yeah)
"Whatever u do son, a little discipline is what u need,
To a castle in the valley
Next beat kickin' the jughead (jughead)
Somebody
And who's to say, just how much longer
Crawl over 2 me on your stomach done)
The drummer's gonna tap
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
When I see your naked body's wet (when your body's wet,body's wet)
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom?"
U want (Lovesexy) me to s...suck around your living room
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking 2.
How many books u read - "Is Hemmingway dead?"
And then a beautiful girl the most
(If U will, so will I)
When I need another human's touch, I wear a frown
Fascinating word called love
(it was truly truly)
But I got 2 have your face
Listen
I wanna kiss u, baby yeah I want your lips
2night I'll teach U baby, teach U baby, teach U baby
Ask the Victor 'bout pain and rejection
(Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long)
I'm waiting for the love, sugar
Why you wanna treat me so bad
Get close, have no fear, (have no fear)
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
There won't be no ball and no chain
Because at the time, no 1 was lucky
"I ain't got time to play."
I even gave you my body
Go
U ask me if I'll kiss U, it's automatic
It blows with ease
Viriginity or menopause
Can't U just trust me?
(Waiting for the love) Say..
Falling in love with the face in a magazine (uh oh, not again)
"Since U've been gone"
Everybody in this room
And wanted 2 know if I thought I was qualified, yeah
If long life is what we all live 4
The castle started spinning
She'll want me from my head 2 my feet
Until u're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must
Well, all u people out there, (push)
Is it worth a child dying 4? (is it worth it?)
Release it, boy. Go on stella, dance.
I'll give you some money
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Don't break what left of my broken heart, baby
U will go before me, baby (they will shine 4 ever)
What's the use in half a story, (What's the use in half a story)
Wait a minute, what's he doin'? (get stupid, get stupid)
Now everybody clap your hands
(If I was your girlfriend)
So take it slow baby, and let's unwind
My camera's gonna get U when U get it good and wet
I'll introduce U 2 my ride
It's so great to be alive, oh yeah
Band!
U been done known better, oh, and how
I wish there were no rules
'cause I never see you anymore
That'll rock your, rock your, rock your world, oh
Who's 2 blame when he's got no place 2 go
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Pose a threat 2 my brother
Yeah!
Hey, hey, people what u come here 4? We want to shake something.
U know I'm guilty, yeah, (4 all my future crimes)
We're gonna shake, we're gonna quake
Still waiting
Yes - if U want this feeling called love
Cuz u got the burnin' desire
That the love we make is really pretty rude
(Y got to slow down)
I just need your body baby
1 day I'll make a play and she will say ok
That I wanna lose in you,
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy)
Then tell me what will!
And they will shine 4 ever
Like Evian and the deep blue sea
Or maybe I'm just too naive
I can say I hope U are in these arms of mine
Everybody in the east
All the boys, grab a girl, get down on the floor
Where?
That's the only way it'll get bigger
Seems 2 happen 2 me each and every time we make love
Baby, baby, we're gonna work it out
Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
A world of never ending happiness
Hot thing, barely 21
And if it's still good to ya
So I won't waste your time
Wait now, hang up, dial tone on the 3
The angel of hate - she taught me how 2 kick her
One - Oh Daddy
Nothing that will break us apart
If we can't find no place to go
4teen years and tears I've longed 2 sing my song
That's why he had 2 wait
I've been waiting such a bloody long time
Like a strawberry (Come), chocolate
C'mon, c'mon, you
If I see 11
Sign up on the dotted line
Shall we go back? Let's go
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
There are over 500 experiences 2 choose from
Everybody shake. (shake, shake, shake)
Housequake, housequake
All good things that say, never last
Oh Cindy C
vous etes belle
Lord I might get tired,
I'm testing (we can funk) positive and I'll pee some more
It don't mean your rep cuz U kiss in a restaurant
Controversy, controversy
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Let me see u dance
Sing with me now...
But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
I'm just-a rock hard in a funky place
Everybody on the dancefloor
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday, (don't matter)
U better live now
But U gotta talk 2 me, baby, tell me who U really r
The road u chose 2 walk in this life (the road u choose 2 walk in this life)
Everybody wants to be on top
I don't want to regret what I've done to you
Can you relate?
If you're out there, girl, please come to me
That 1's 4- That 1's 4- 4 U have 2 live
Oh, no let's go!
She say love me, love me.
Gotta keep it that way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's O-O-K
Hurt me
(don't... don't... don't say it preacher)
That I show no other, I wanna be
Will u fuck with me,
Somebody say dance (dance), music (music),
This love (This love is a private affair)
How u wanna be done?
We ain't leavin' 'til they (oh daddy)
I love U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
Oh stella, I know u came alone
(I wish we were all nude)
I can't help it - like a honey 2 a bee -
2 make u do the do (2 make u do the do)
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what, what silence looks like
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
Damn u
U gotta rock this mother down
2 commit the crimes of passion
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
Oh baby it's true, I know I do (2 with U)
Don't u want 2 play with me? (Yes)
(drips)
We could stroll the mezzanine (stroll)
Everybody's looking 4
Then U can see how love will bloom
Strive 2 be the very best that u can be (strive) (sweet baby)
Do U know? (strange relationship)
The pop seem, hmmm, a little overrated
Or maybe she's just 2 proud 2 say
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
It gets me every time
I wanna be loved 4 all time (4 all time)
(I understand)
He's looking 4 an angel to hold him 'til the morning light
(willin' and able)
But honey I'm rich on personality
Talk, guitar, talk
The Endorphinmachine
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition
We gotta do it in your momma's car
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
See this gold chain around my waist
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
Or are they only artificial tears? (artificial tears)
They stand in the way of love
How she know me when. Damn, here we go again (what he say?)
Je vous enlacerai avec mes jambes
Over your climax and over mine,
Everybody always told me
Attempt 2 roast and even boast about (what)
Gotta always have you in my heart
'Cause me and u could have been a work of art
America, America
I may be qualified 4 a one night stand
Just like u're supposed 2 do (...speak english...)
(La da da da da da)
With a bucket filled with squirreled meat
Tonight we're gonna get the bomb, y'all
I'll pay the fee (Cindy C)
"What's up little girl?"
This time I promise,
All the fighting stopped
Everybody here we go, come on now,
What lurks in the gallows of my mind
We're kickin' down the door
If I don't think about the fact that she left me
Trouble winds r blowin', I'm growin' cold
Joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again,
Before I tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, bang, all over u
If we took a little walk
(Gett off)
((Frankie, how do u know...))
Such a double drag
Keep the blood flowing down 2 your feet
Cuz' I can do, said I can do
U're like a good pill
Why U put another down?
Na na na na na na, so slow (say it again - na na na na na na, so slow)
So pump the big noise, c'mon in the house...
Oh, no Let's Go!
(Les enfants qui mentent ne vont pas au paradis)
Oh, oh, temptation.
When the blood of my love outraces
U'll have an instant heart attack if I jack u off
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
A lover
I'm gonna go to the car
[Chorus]
(What is sacrifice?)
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love
And I'm thinkin' about some of that
Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho
Cuzzin' when Spooky say dead, U better say died
Yea, Oh, Alphabet Street
Cuz sugar, U know U're just the kind of lover
(we could have fun just strollin')
Hot thing, When U smile, when U smile, when U smile
Shy (Shy)
They made him pledge allegiance
With that I jammed, you fool,
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
All of the questions in my life will be answered
Open your heart, open your mind
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack u off
So come vibe with us
U've been chosen, P
love U (love U), and miss U (miss U)
Turn all the lights up 2 10
U'd make us all go back 2 start
(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)
I think U... uh...
So how u wanna be done? (how u wanna be done?)
It's getting stronger, baby
Are you ready? (Hey!)
Darlin' Nikki
They're, they're musicians
U and me a starring in a movie called "Amour"
Don't understand why u (hurt me in the dark)
(damn u)
But I'm scared, 'cause if I don't kiss ya, I'm gonna go mad baby
(Get on the mike...) Slow down - I'm a push up on it
(God created woman) (soul)
Same motherfuckin' shit
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Better keep it greasy
La la la la la, do do do do do
Well, I ordered - "Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't 2 hungry"
Just lay back
So U might as well plead guilty cuz U sure can't plead the 5th
Arm light on
Baby, u blow my mind
No regrets, no sorrow - I'm goin' back 2morrow 2 make sure he's dead
But more than that - I want U
Say, we need to get wild again like it was when we first met
Gett off - 23 positions in a 1 night stand
(We gotta break it on down, down, down)
Yeah - this is 4 the hood
If U just open your eyes (still would stand all time)
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I'm honest... Watched 'em bleed 'em
(Get funky) [x3]
I can make u happy (I can make u H.A.P.P.Y)
Every day is a yellow day
Maybe u could think
U want me to swivel in your love seat
Uh, talkin' more Schick than a Bic
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right
Give yourself a bone
Hey yeah, What time it is, love machine
I'm not a woman
The smile on their faces
...it was the same thing that made Eve take the 1st bite
Young and old, gather 'round
Hot thing, tell them you're coming home late,
(Get on the mike...)
Now I don't usually talk to strangers
Of fishin' 4 logic in a think tank
As they toddled round and round
I get delirious when you hold my hand (Delirious)
'Twas like thunder (oh) all thru the night (all through)
Like he's drinking seven up
Kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?
4 far 2 long
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
We need love & honesty, peace & harmony
Pretty thing keeps worrying about keeping on her feet
She always stood at the back of the line
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!
A peanut-butter sandwich (her and her girlfriend)
There's no one in the world, baby
Let's get out of here (yeah)
Anyone that's ever touched it,
It's time 2 fix your clock
If U had the chance 2 see the future would U try?
[backwards at the end...]
I'll kick your ass... twice
I think I'm gonna like this
Makin' sure your soul's alright (make certain that your soul's alright)
If I was just closer 2 somethin' (closer)
Spooky Electric will be your boss"
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red corvette
Forever, forever, I want U baby, baby forever (U can make right)
What's it like inside your tamborine?
They rather see u on the run push
And night and day would run together, and all things would b fine
Say ooh, ooh, yeah (Help me! Someone please help me! Somebody help me)
As I step to the mic and lend a hand (oh daddy)
Oh yes
That I've been dreaming of
Instead she pretended she was blind
When the day turns into the last day of all time
Play music sex romance
And I'm not afraid
"Stop the press..."
Every time they try 2 clock u push
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light (it will be all right)
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?
Have u done this before? (I don't know)
'cause you treat me just like a child
We just wanna jam
I said, "We don't wanna fight no more"
There!
Girls first, girls first
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tennessee
"I've tried to avoid all this, but I can't"
I came and took your love, I took your body
I gotcha where I wantcha (baby)
Dead on it, on it, on it
BATMAN
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)
Do you cry 4 me, do u cry, do u cry?
This is some new hype stuff u're facin'
We r here 2 do service
U got that look
If I come back as a woman, I want a body like yours
A body like yours oughta be in jail
It feels just like the end
If U know how 2 party say 'oh yeah' (oh yeah)
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Then college, the master degree
I, how you say
It hurt me so bad when she told me
With different color socks
That's when it all up and flies away
I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Our Father, who art in Heaven
U damn right, that's how it be (I see)
Cuz if I don't, they'll call me a chicken, but U can call me ... "
Till the rain is over and gone
Uh, slammin'
It beats so strong
People tell us what we want 2 hear
She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
Sure 2 like his pearls
If U change your mind, U can reach me on your video phone
No-sha-sha
I want 2 scream and shout your...
New Power Generation style
I say, sitting idle in our boat while everyone else is down the stream
I'm thinkin' about some of this
My contract... Years after this my kids are still
Love is God, God is love
You're the wind and the rain
U know there ain't no other
I've as many legs as you
U got 2 shake something. My lord.
And if de-elevator tries 2 bring u down

What kind of boy would dis, a list, as long as his-tory itself
You now for a long time No

For thine is the kingdom and the power
If U could just learn 2 smile

But in going down an alley

Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass

My God was worried 'til he heard me sing
This love is a private affair
In a deep sleep I fell
I get delirious whenever you're near
(we sacrifice)
Some are BIG, some are small
She asked me if we could be friends
I gotta gun
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool
Don't cry unless you're happy, don't smile unless you're blue

I met her in a hotel lobby
She couldn't stand the glory, she would be 2nd to none
I never could resist
You don't have to worry, my love is forever
And I spend my days just a-trying
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
I just can't win a race
If you got the time
Unless I have a kiss
I can hang when u're around
2 night we video...
Are you sure you don't wanna close your eyes?
Walked into the place.

What you need is a manager (That's what I'm sayin')

Go crazy - punch a higher floor
Work!
"Ooh, baby U're so good"

Would U let me wash your hair
4 him each day she had a smile
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock (oh Daddy)
[Chorus:]
I don't really wanna go crazy but I'm helpless as a pet
He got snatched by his Papa who then opened up the closet door
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
Then again we could die from the rush (rush)

The best that I can
A rich sucker's kids. Hell,
But U are a natural beauty unaffected (unaffected)

And propose 2 overexpose disclose
If I gave u diamonds and pearls (Pearls)

No more, no more (No more will U cry)
Cat, what's happenin' babe? (Bitch, would U play something?)
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
There ain't no reason 2 stay
Huh, can U dig it?
This court is now in session
Push I push

Tells her about the fallacy that 1 race rules over the other
Face the music
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
U feel like a movie star
Til your love is red
Are U diggin' this, baby? (Oh)
I would drink every drop
Check it
Cuz I hate U
It's truly mighty strong (truly, I... I)
And we will see a plague and a river of blood
Who asked her lover "Why is your organ so small?"
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
But you were untrue.
Partyman
Then break them all cuz u are the best
That there's hope 4 a kid
2 be the best that u can be
Me? No I'm not a man. Jerome? He's an adventure.
Maybe we'll unlock the
and let's play
1-2-3-4! 1-2-3-4!
"Stop the press, who is that?"
I want to come inside of you
I am something that you'll never understand
Aspire 2 be higher, I admire so I fire
Tick more than they tock
Two thousand zero zero party over,
Now tell me what u're gonna do
Imagine what U look like from across the room
And forgive us our trespasses
From now on U'll be here with me
Everybody needs a thrill
I love u, baby
Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
U got that look, yes U do (yes U do)
So much better when we take our time
That she would wear the same
I know, that U know, without U there is no me
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...
I had to give this message the so-called truth
Anything at all
Let me tell ya
I know what you want me to do
Black night seemed like the only way...
Maybe we could do the twirl
Now's the time (now's the time) 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
What's the matter with your life
Cuz I'm willin' (willin')
That the nights you're not with me I'm scared that you're gonna leave
"O delightful little brother! (can't nobody fuck with us)
If we can just bear the cross
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Partyman, partyman
u want another someone (u want another someone)
Cuz once your love has gone away
Going down, going down, going down
Am I the weaker man
A smile beneath her nose
Baby, when you never come around
Don't be afraid, baby
I'm sorry baby, that's the rules
And the kick drum is the fault
But something about the clouds and her mixed
Why can't u learn 2 play the game?
And girl I got a lot
Did u ever stop 2 wonder
I change the rules and do what I wanna do
Mine is temptation, it reigns at a party where lovers splurge
Round and round we go, round and round we go
Do u want 2 go?
Party people in the crib get hyped. (yeah)
Grow
Cuz Lovesexy is the one til my day is done
Joy - oh my private joy
This ain't about the trippers trippin' like they know they be
He'll still have 2 give
It was only last June when her old man ran away
I say do whatever we want, wear lingerie 2 a restaurant
(push it) (push)
And put on that wig I bought U
(we sacrifice) (joy around the corner)
Are your smiles, are your smiles 4 me?

Baby I'll tell u down on my knee, yeah
They've taken a lifetime lease
Oh, motherfucker's, just a motherfucker
I know it's gonna be lonely
This one's dedicates 2 the whores
"I'm BATMAN"
Closer 2 your higher self
I'm so in love with you
Let's relax and ease our mind (mind)
But my body will never be the same
Aha aha
I said, let's scream and shout your...
And we were naked and did not care
When I call U up, I wanna tell U what 2 wear
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong
That's the only (Come) Come I know
At every funeral it rained every time I sang
2 night why don't we skip all the 4 play, mamma
but she was promised 2 another man
Love you til you're dead
What U come 2 say? (Get funky [x2])
The passion's in the mix. (Serve it up, Sheila)
Up on the 2, swing on the 4
U'll believe in somethin' before this night is through
I just want u smarter than I'll ever be
I said walk, like u could use a ride?
And says 'Money don't matter 2 night'
I get a dirty mind
But the reward is great
I ask thee would u, could u,
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night
And just get down here on the floor
Every time U do me, do me baby
When a rocket blows
I've seen a many bridges in my time and crossed every one of 'em
U got the horn so why don't u blow it
Push your way up 2 the front and shake your motherfuckin' 'do
Hey Ducky, let me stick the 7-inch
And if they do then what we gonna do?
Said ya don't wanna play by nobody's rules"
Even if I wasn't thirsty,
I wonder if U have any mercy, don't torture me
(I'm so sorry for u...)
And when we do (When we do)
All my vital signs go up a couple of notches
One day over this hoodie
The J-U-G-H-E-A-D, and I'm flowin' with it
Girl, I'll take u to a movie show, we can sit in the back
Hole in yo head. Hole in yo head
A road that he's afraid 2 walk on his own (I'm at that road)
You're just-a rock hard in a funky place
If u try and say u're crazy, everybody say electric chair
Now morning, noon, and night
I gave you all of my love
But honey I know, ain't nothing
"U don't, now die!"
What color is your money today? [this is sung in a round]
Then everything will be Alright
I got a lion in my pocket,
I just wanna have a bloody good time
Without a pistol, without a gun
That got her all wet (Wet)
What's the use? (half of a dream)
I took one look at you
I'll want 2 kiss u and then I won't
While he masturbates and now I see a tear
(willin')
And I'll jack u off
Go crazy
Well, why can't we just dance?
Your mouth than manure.
I never thought that I could feel this way

Answer the 2 of life and death

He had 2 run away, his pride was 2 strong
Temptation, temptation
Now go-go-go, go-go-go
I don't care pretty baby
I can't help it, Martha {'insatiable' repeated in the background}
Hot thing, tell them you're going 2 the Crystal Ball
Is the mailman jerking U 'round?
They thought I was asleep, but I'm sayin'
Would U let me give U a bath?
Freedom
That stands 2 catch U when U fall (Oh!)
It started raining, baby, the birds were gone

He just makes her point the pistol 2 his nose
The way Annie tells the story, she's his only son
I've got to have it
One of my ribs He took and it shall be
(My love is just a drippin')
Just as sure as Noah built the ark
And go in there
I only want to lay you down
I want U.
This experience will cover courtship, sex, commitment
This is 4 the cab U have 2 drive 4 no money at all
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Forgive me 4 my sins
(Go Morris go Morris go Morris)
I think I... I think I... I think I love her
I'm delirious (Delirious)
U can dance if U want 2
Because I understand
Ah, yeah
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end
I hope you don't mind I'm

Don't be shy, it's only U and I
Wit' yo' little almond-shaped head ass
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
What's the hangup? What's the scam?
I'm talkin' 2 the people I meet (tellin' me now, just walkin')
I'll make it happen fast
Close the shop, let's take a ride (strollin', strollin')
I only do it for a worthy cause
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
U can set your mind free, yeah
Hey
But that was then, this is
Sleek neat creepin' gangk peepin'
Positivity
This is my house and I'm prone
Tellin' U just how fine U look
We can go dancing baby every night
Everybody on the block say it is the best
The cool of cools
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
The gentle breeze
And I could never take the place of your man
Would U let me in?
Rock hard in a funky place
U'd better be 'ware
Still I keep Vicki
Push
The spirit is calling
Baby it's true, I think I do
Coupled with the fact that u belong 2 another
Takin' a hunk, chunk
People everywhere, loosen up your hair
That if we play in the same key everything will be
I love u baby, I love u so much,
Now that U got it, let's do the twist
I don't know when I'll return.
But they ain't got a shot (shot)
Sexy dancer
I get delirious whenever you're near (Delirious)
He never once said thank U, never please
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
Take a look around u
Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
Japanese say 1 time ooh (ooh), alright (alright),
If u think I came 2 jerk around (don't say it)
There was a woman from the ghetto
Here we go, willing and able
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life (U can make right)
I'm drowning without U here, my dear
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
We could have a good time
And the next...
What misfortune left your heart so broken U only say
Wishing and wishing for days, baby
Oh baby my one and only desire (make this feelin' last)
Now all of the sudden (all of the sudden)
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night
Think about IT all the time (fuckin' on your mind)
Scrambled eggs, are so boring, 4 u're all, all that I want 2 know
Come on tell me what U taste
What's the matter, don't u like me?
Round and round we go. Round and round we go.
Look 4 the purple banana
To tell the truth, tell me what's my line?
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
U + me, what a ride
Love me 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
Do it all night
But that's alright, cuz in my possession, there's a signed confession
This is 4 why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah 2 night
Oh, girl!
When she tell me everything {tell me}
And God created woman (woman)
Shake your body 'til your neighbors stare at cha!
Baby, won't you set me free?
Poor butterfly who don't understand
If I gotta scream and shout (if I gotta scream and shout)
Everybody...
He begs 4 love, while she's disgusted more
I'll show U
(Let me take it around)
U got 2 go through it all (go through it all)
Shut up already, damn, U got 2 get off!
No, damn it! Turn the music back up!
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Can't you get to this?
U're hired. Let's go. Shake! Shake!
Love machine, what time it is, love machine
Baby, baby,
My dearest, my dearest
It makes me feel so bad
This is it
Then Heaven on Earth we will find
(Lose me now boy)
Serve it up, Frankie
4 he knows what I'm dreaming of
In the event there is overexcitement
Before she got dick in her drawers
Is just roll his eyes, and say that...
And it's got a funny way of stoppin' the juice
Ooo, everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright
Somebody, anybody, everybody wave your hand
I never thought that U would be the one
C-c-c-c-c-come on!
I wanna, I wanna: (Who U callin' bitch? Ho bitch!)
I saw your friend 1st
But u left me in such a cold cold world to suffer in (kick it)
2 your lovely face
With every other flick of the pink plush
(yeah - I wanna)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Dancing 2 the beat 'til we lose our mind control
I've got the toys, 2 turn your body out
Every time I could, I would compilment u on the things,
And I'll come back again as a dolphin
(I wish there was no black and white)
Swing low to the tempo
(get off me, punk, U ain't sexy)
Shall I write the alphabet, (A-B-C-D-E-F-G)
Fast or slow like a Leslie goes
(Oh-we-oh-oooh)
Get the funk up!
U should do that baby (Here's a reason why)
Should he try 2 rap with her? Should he stand and stare?
When I lie awake in my boudoir (I think of u)
The kind of love that takes over your
Sometimes I feel so bad
Good times were rolling
White, Black, Puerto Rican
Raise your cane (cane)
Epilectic 'til the age of 7
(Don't say it, preacher)
It's easy 2 see us on the cover of a magazine
Ain't gonna tell nobody nobody 'bout my little pretty toy
Because I love U (Because I love U)
Wasn't ever filed in your name
Controversy
Cuz when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go
Guitars and drums on the 1
Whenever I'm around u, baby
(Shy)
U lie! Love come (Lie!) in a hurry (Lie!)
But you never go too far
Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (live 4 love)
Do u lie, do u lie? (or do u cry)
Did U do 2 your other man the same things that U did 2 me?
I am a dove
When he unties her and she runs 2 the open door
And I'm the wildest in the city
I guess I should've closed my eyes
(Pheromone) When I see your naked
I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know
And we'll groove and groove until the earth moves (Whip it)
Oh, baby don't go!
We r the new power generation, you've gotta give up all the fight
He just pushes her away in a huff
If U take your life 4 granted, your beating heart will go
Well, what's your favorite car - "Green Rolls-Royce"
Cuz 2 night I'm, 2 night I'm gonna be your fantasy!
They dead, they dead on it, on it
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunchbox
I've seen the future and it works
Honey, before we go wrong
All the other kids would love to love you but you're my little private joy
And now I want 2, I wanna curse u baby
I am what she wants 2 see
Get up, get up, get in
Race Race
I can see it all
Would u be a happy boy or a girl
I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain
It's gonna be lonely, baby
The max - Yo baby (oh yeah), tell me where the party's at
Don't walk where it feels the best?
Still would stand all time (still would stand all time)
Oh baby, don't you know?
If U will, (So will I) if U will, so will I (So will I)
I don't see no 5 dollars U owe...
Who pulls a cheap one (whatcha do?)
To change the sheets
And I've been looking 4 so long
U whispered something
Shake! (shake on it... for me)
One that deserves a copy made?
They don't want anything else (no they don't)
Funny but it seems that you're alone like me
(2 the max)
Sittin' in the back and I'll jack u off
The one who will listen when all others will not.
I'm warm enough when
I just want your extra time and your
It's kinda like a movie but U're the star
I guess that's what I'll try 2 be
And now all I wanna say is
Like a circus clown (get on the mike)
Joy - come on honey baby get up, get up
We were brothers and sisters
Shall we dream of each other naked? (Shit.)
Release it. Man, let them drums kick.
Yeah, Stockholm Sweden, we love ya
Maybe u and I should be undressing
Of your ooh! pretty, pretty
I'm not afraid (oh my god)
Sleeping inbetween the two of us
You just gotta let me lay ya
(Dig it) When my body starts to shiver from the chill of
Don't be shy, this won't hurt a bit
(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart)
Color me takin' aback
Inside lookin' out my window
Every time they try 2 clock u
'God only knows where U are 2 night'
All I want is 2 spend the night in your arms
When it comes 2 life, 2 be this man's wife
Three seats over there's a lady black
Get up offa my block, because
(When U) When I lay U down I'm gonna tell U what 2 feel
Or shall I just write my name
Then listen up girl, yeah
That's alright, I clock 'em that way
More baby more
Oh why
Don't wait 4 your neighbor
That's how sure I am u broke my heart
Damn this kooky love affair
There's something I wanna mention
And all the things that we could do
Does anybody know you're here?
This is how they play the game
We ain't got no time 4 excuses, the promised land belongs 2 all
(Billy Jack, Billy Jack) [x2]
I want U in the worst way.
[song breaks down into a crowd noise...]
Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero party over,
What makes a man wanna play guitar? (A double A double arrogance)
(sing it)
I got grooves and grooves up on the shelf (oh daddy)
Laugh behind it while we're eatin' ice cream (ha ha ha ha)
"Hi, Bruce Wayne"
Hey Bob, if u're out there, let me see u dance
Acting out a whim is only good
Come back Nikki, come back
U are with me, U are with me
Anything I would do, but up until u tell me 2
U've got 2 try my new funk
My little secret, my private joy
Wendy?
Unaffected by the system, she'd rather die
For the funkiest band in the land and don't forget
I know that's right, 'cause I am the latest fashion
Cindy, Cindy. I'll pay the usual fee
Come on, get stupid, get stupid
Baby I don't care I would rip out my hair
Everybody work - that's right, everybody everybody
If u don't like the world you're living in
Remember, next time U fly, fly the International Lover
Honey, u danced so hard I smelled your perfume, (maybe we can stay in touch)
Tell me do u like what u hear?
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
When you were mine
Yeah, that's right
All is well in Gotham City
While my right embraces time
Can U hear me? (A-U-T-O-matic)
Fellas? (yeah) hit me, but dontcha lag
Ooops, I just stepped in it... (push)
(I love u baby)
I'll do anything I can just
The steps U take are no easy road (the steps you take are no easy road)
Stand up everybody, this is your life
Please access another ex..
But 2 your ways I will not bend
Everybody... everybody's looking (Everybody's looking 4 the answers)
Would U let me dress U
When they don't know what it's made of?
There's a future (sure, you're right) a future worth fighting 4
Maybe if u cop a nut in the car (Maybe if u cop a nut in the car)
But she's happy she ain't in the red
Alright,Blue light
Don't talk
She got a lot of tips
Welcome 2 the New Power Generation
Close - don't worry about nobody else
Being good was such a bore, so she bought a gun
Keep your body hot
I wanna bust that body right
There are thieves in the temple tonight
(Whisper) Whisper a question
Would U listen 2 me then?
Every single 1 of us knows some kind of pain
U cried in ecstacy
All of my cool attitude U took
Well
Let's just pretend we're married, tonight
All of the steps in between (the steps in between)
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Will u love me 2 the 9's (I'll love u 2 the 9's)
I never want to let you go, no, no
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what 2 do
If I get a camera,
The latest fashion
Wanna be loved, sugar (love 2 the 9's)
3 4, 3 4, 99
C'mon let me show u how a boy and girl supposed 2 have fun
I know, that U know that I ain't cheatin' baby
All space and time, so don't cry
Go on ahead my dear and dance
People wanna take it back
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls
Didn't your mama tell U
What if I told U that U're worth
Like u like it, I can lick it like u like it.
2 bad
[repeated over chorus]
I wouldn't change a stroke
I was only 16, but I guess that's no excuse
Cuz 2 me baby that would be so fine
You're so slippery
I didn't want you to be mis-led
That's a little shady, for this lady was only 16 years old.
Live 4 love, without love u don't live
Sex-related fantasy is all that my mind can see
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright (it's gonna be alright)
U are my every fantasy
And you were so strange
Take me away!
But I always, always want to be with you
Ah... am I gettin' U hot? (Hot)
Keepin U from me and me from U as we grow
I only want to see you, only want to see you
Ask where they're going
In a violent room
2 send a child off 2 war
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue
Lauch procedure commence
I'm not your lover
Everything u do is success
"I'd like 2"
Do U ever really try? (Do U ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?)
Can't live with U, can't live without U
Masturbating with a magazine
I put on crooked shoes
I never been 1 2 hide my feelings
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except 4 me
There was a dame from London
(Bitch) [Fishbone's "Lyin' Ass Bitch" sample repeats throughout song]
These 2 words, a little bit behind the beat.
Where the love grows
Education got important, so important 2 Victor
Pussy said "Nigga, U crazy if U don't know
Don't you know that I could die, baby
Open letters aren't the only things that open wounds
(Pheromone) When I see your naked body's wet
Remind me of something James used to say...
Thunder ohhh
Woman
But now I'm done
And a side order of ham
This chair goes round and round, I feel like a clown
U wanna hurt me baby, oh yes u do
Oh here I come
I know there is a heaven and a hell
So quiet, I can hear the blood rushing through my veins
girls and boys (girls and boys)
Got to party up
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Love - nobody know just how it was born
How many kids u got - "Egads, I'm shocked!"
My name is Prince the one and only - hurt me (You can't stop Prince)
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
When I'm on I feel good
Release it.
People wanna take it back p-push
U said u loved me! (Thieves in the temple)
Do u want me?
play, play, play, play, play, play, play
Who's horns are these blowing? Mine.
Why? Why?
La da da da da da
Don't cry, he is coming
We chill on that
4 in the distance, 12 souls from now
Come on pretty baby now don't be shy.
When they tell me that I can't live forever
Swing it 2 the right, savoir faire
Bob, if u're out there
Long hard shiny rocket ships can fly U 2 the moon
Paisley Park is in your heart
Sweet song of salvation
4 lovin' him from the start
Daddy Pop's in the house
Louder, say it (housequake)
Maybe you'd understand
All the sisters like it when u lick 'em on the knees
That u and your girlfriends used 2 ride all up and down
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that Love is bad
But I know love is the only way till my dying day
This is your conscience, motherfucker [that responds to his call, when]
Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
Thinking 'bout the crazy things you do, crazy you
Steady wishin' he was in your car
What's up with that?
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
(Not with your lips but with your soul)
Hot thing, looking 4 big fun
Everybody sing together, say ooh (ooh), alright (alright),
Free 2 go most anywhere, anytime
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Welcome 2 The Dawn
What U wanna play? (Get funky)
(yeah)
Yeah, I can be your big strong man
Don't make me chase you
Must I become naked? No image at all?
"Ever dance with the devil in the pale moon light?"
Don't pick my apples, don't pick my peaches
Only if you're good girl
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
To you that you like
I don't care 2 win awards
U are my saviour, U are my light (Forever I want U in my life)
And gangk any clown who ain't down
Do I believe in me?
It said thank you for a funky time
1 2, 1 2, '94
Don't u fall
Little girl at the party,
"Although we're worlds apart"
Come here baby, yeah
I don't wanna die
(Hey y'all, I thought we bust this new hype before)
Soldiers are a marching, they're writing brand new laws
Cause it's all about the clockin' (push)
This time it's serious
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
With that type of hype
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Ha na na-sha na na na na na na
I am the main thing
I just can't keep it to myself
2 hell with hesitation
Shake!
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
Until u get 2 higher ground
Now, my Lord I understand
If you like 2 fight, you're a double-drag fool
Yes - bold steps must be taken
And I just wanna tell U that I wanna with U (baby, if U do 2)
(Baby I'm a star)
In your funky town (housequake)
If u don't wanna lick my knees, I'm sho' your mama will
And thinkin' about the way that u kiss (I wanna melt with u)
(the one that was standin')
And when your cup overflow I'll pee some more
I can see her hands tied
In my bedroom (No!) cuz then we'd have 2 stop (Please don't stop)
I did not come 2 funk around (You can't stop Prince)
And before us animosity will stand and decree
She picked up the phone
Prettiest thing in life I've ever seen
But different than the day before
And when u win say, "I knew it" (go 4 it, get 2 it)
Paint a perfect picture
In love
Now that you're near me
Will anybody see the dawn
I'm in a crush
U go 4 me and I come again
This - Yeah, that's 4 me, that's who that 1's 4
(Face the music)
Oooh, sock it to me
Hold on 2 your soul, we got a long way 2 go
Happiness in it's uncut form
U can make right (U are my light)
I can't wait no longer child
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim
It's time we all reach out for something new
Sexy motherfucker
A train is leaving all day
Would u, could u,
Surely die if neither one of us shall ye touch (shall ye touch)
I'm ready 4 the crush
It doesn't matter who's around
Instead of tryin 2 make u stop
And hit the skids before I take care of
Prince esta muerto (Prince is dead)
But now my life is so blue
My contract... A contract ain't no pension plan,
Promise to see jesus in the morning light

Grenade Launcher roars in a television sky

Being caught by someone with your beauty, style and grace
Marvelous - baby, baby, can't U see

My temperature's runnin' hot
If we only want to love one another
IT feels so good IT must be a crime, all right
It ain't no big I's and little U's in my life
And if she did - So what? C'mon baby, let's ball
Should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?
Can't they see what they're doing to me?
Don't you wanna be my fantasy?
It's time 4 a new direction

So remember the truth you cant go wrong
Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing
They know this is serious
Coming

I'd rather see yourself checkin' ass up 2 bat 4 another swing
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to u
Lately trouble winds r blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last
What she told me then got me so hot
Come on, sing
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
They could contemplate the entire universe
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
Dream
Baby, can't see a damn thing out my window it's so dark (so dark)
It was just like a dream
Maybe I'll die young like heroes die

(Waiting for the love) To come around now
And soon she did the same
U made his skeeze freeze
Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly

Hollywood conjures images of the past

Now raise your right hand
Words intended 2 belittle or dismay?
She's a freaked out,

Keep on walkin' down this road (joy around the corner)
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
Honey, I won't be your pappy, (P.U.S.S.Y.)
U put your foot down on the 2
But I still get the feeling I felt the very first time
No, fuck that, fuck that
Everybody say dance (dance), music (music),
But a horse couldn't drag your ass 2 put me on
Say papa, I think I wanna dance

What's to be expected is 3 minus 3... absolutely nothing
U have to, you gotta go
Hang tough children
My love will be your food
No side effects and
It's just all I think about U
Once upon a time in the land of Sinaplenty
We get ice cream, no cake

Want 2 sell, sell, sell (75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!)
Now I spend my time
Somebody help me sing it now
I never would've thought that this would happen
I know there is a heaven, I know there is a hell
Jerome, body language
Your embrace (is it better than a trip?)
2 places within your mind
Just as long as there is you
I'm gonna show you what it's all about
Heavy feather, flicka nipple
Every one of the stallions in your pack - that's when
U have 2 climb all of the steps in between (yeah, we ride)
In the alley over by the curb he said tell me what's your name

And now u're tryin' 2 say that u're writing a bio about me? (kick their ass)
Honey, forget your past (forget your past)
Fair 2 partly crazy, deep down we're all the same
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Never have I ever made love before
Mirror and a tongue inside
The sound of terror is all U hear
Walk faster sweet baby (walk faster)
Drippin' all over U like a ball of wax, relax and let go!
I do!
But they can only do the things that you do
Mary Sweet Mother Jesus
That don't matter y'all, come on

U can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it 4 U
Pheromone, (Pheromone) rush over me like an ocean
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea
The scarlett sweat
And even when I'm right, I'll be wrong,

Since U've been gone
That Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
'Cause baby I'm the most
Yeah yeah yeah

A bridge that leads
Baby scam water ripple
Joy - such a such a pretty toy
Joy, joy in repetition,
Dropped it on the floor

How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve (Gett off)
And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky

So tight
This beat is on time, refined and designed
This song's about a high class model,

The kind U find in a second hand store
There's a rumor goin' all round that u ain't been gettin' served (Gett off)
Close your eyes
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (wait a minute) (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
U, U gotta climb, U gotta climb (U have 2 climb all)
They know we need each other
It kinda turned me on when she looked at me
I think I love.
Place in your heart
And everybody cried
How could I forget that U are the rule
I feel just like the sky, oh, so blue
Because the way 2 make u hot
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Your seat cushion may be used as a flotation device

Up and down, up and down, like a pony would
U know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied
So they can be free
My boss was Mr. McGee

It's such a shame our friendship had to end
Ladies, make'em act like they know
Pretty soon you'll get enough
Cool
Your heart, your heart, your heart (sing, sing it)
This party, this party is gonna last all night
From all this cold despair
30,000 feet and still-a-counting (live 4 love)
And you said
Yeah, yeah [repeated to fade]
If u're tired of the masturbater
U make me so confused
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line (Get in line!)
Some of U may not want 2 know
"Live 4 Love, without love u don't live"
Tell me, baby, ain't that enough?
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop (Oh no, my brother)
Your right 2 die and live again, live again, live again
If u really really want to be a star
"The jester's on the phone!"
Would U please look at this mother next 2 me
Said to myself, said
(Delirious)
We gotta try 2 love one another, baby. we r the new power generation
The dream we all dream of (oh, please!)
I want 2 melt with u
So high, the stars are under me
A-push if ya wanna push
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Up and down, up and down, on the beat y'all
Maybe U think I'm being
Uh uh!
Don't say I didn't warn ya
In my darkest hour I find
Don't wanna do without your...
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Strollin', strollin' we could have fun just strollin'
Of the past, for life, prince... (I said who popped the question?)
U're the reason ... oh yeah
Companies say that you need em!
Say u got 2 go through it (go through it)
There's some talk going 'round town
If your body needs water
(right next to my woman)
Nothing, but who's paying the bills?
Let's make a toast yo
that can do the duty in your bed, yeah
This is where she wants 2 be
Forever, forever, forever
Whenever you say that you can't -
{do that girl, do that girl}
So come on y'all (oh yeah)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W.
It happens to me everytime (time, time, time...)
(So dark, dark, so dark)
Better days gonna come your way, yeah
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
I gotta know, I gotta know
I never seen a pretty girl look so tough' baby (baby)
Hopefully, that will not occur; the man above has been paid
I'll be damned if I let u play this hand
The max - We can dance if u want 2 (ooh yeah), but I might break yo back
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Soft and wet (U know)
Over and over and over and over and over and over
For all time
No not cha body, yo mind u fool
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinkin'
What can I lose,
I may not be your style
Frankie, play something, bitch!
We want this one 2 go worldwide
Because something near your leg
Take off my clothes. We can funk
Tony, you... And you laugh at my brother Little Richard
Girl it ain't no use, you might as well get loose
Alright say, we'll put some funk on here
If ever you decide to go
Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know
(When I blow that mind baby)
I can't stop I ain't got no brakes
I know that's not the way 2 be
Feeling, feeling, feeling, hey!
Would u be a happy boy or a girl (Yeah yeah)
When the 2 R in love
Look, here's a cool investment
(Outside) All sides (All sides), up and down (up and down)
You're gonna run your body right into the ground
Everybody on this earth has got a vice
(Melody, Melody Cool, Melody... long before U)
And naughty things that we could do
When it comes down 2 u
At the Club International Balls
Bass
Oh yeah, we gettin' funky in the house tonite
I know what I want, yeah
Grace, if u so much as think I can't do the do
U're just a simpleton
Hot thing, tell them U found a brand new baby doll
My brain is jackin' all over the place
Baby, lay me down
Blow that devil away!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why)
Everybody wants to know how the story (How the story started)
U jerk your body like a horny pony would
Tryin' 2 deal with all your fears
I just don't, I don't know what to say
U got electric ass baby
Joy, you are my private joy
Her favorite number was 20 and every single day
Always smash the picture
(Be my friend) Dolphin
This is the max
U're fuckin' right.
If 4 any reason there is a loss in cabin pressure
The fun don't stop the bacon
if you're coming home at all
A pregnant mother sings
Honey, we can't last (we can't last)
When we're kissing long and hard
I, dream of you
Until a man truly dies
Showed me where it's supposed to go
Does anybody know about the quake? (yeah!)
What if I gave it, your body I ask
Brother Lois will be around in a minute
(are you ready Paris - Soul Clap)
And the 2 and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it
Am I black or white?
So peep stella, peep stella,
I told the joke about the woman
Music late, nothing great (Music late, nothing great)
She had so many devices
Interrupt the flow (They better not dare)
So just put your foot on the gas - let's drive
Is the poverty bringing U down?
From the highest mountain top (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Every time U wander
all of the things U are 2 me (sugar)
Dolphin
I wanna be the only one you come for
Built like she was
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
of life
This is what she'd say
Are you ready?
Beggin her to please come home, yeah, yeah
"It can do no harm to try (fuck with us)
Yeah - we gettin' funky (get funky in the house tonite)
U should do that baby
Knew I got 2 getcha, got 2 getcha, before u're all gone.
When it slaps him in the face?
Would u be, would u, would u
Undress me (A-U-T-O-matic)
So will I
And give me a break, cause
This ain't about the body, it's about the mind
You're doing the housequake
(Long live the New Power Generation)
How can u sleep knowing that u and a fool
We're gonna rock him
My little angel from heaven above
I think you better close it
Forever until my love is through, I, I will love you
Till, to see them safely back
But I just can't seem 2 get close enough (I want to hold U)
If there's life after, we will see
That skinny motherfucker with the high voice?
Yeah, do that baby, just like a dog (ooh, I wanna melt with u)
And a promise to see Jesus in the morning light (mornin' light)
Shakin' that ass
I,I wanna do it, oh yeah
Why can't we just dance?
Make him man enough to say he's 50-50 girl (A double A double arrogance)
I'm gonna have one of them sandwiches.
I feel it right down 2 my toes
Don't try 2 clock 'em, they're much too fast
I'll bust u like a pimple, son
Would u hug me on a crowded street?
If your man ain't no good
(Do U ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?) Try, try
