As u pump the volume to what I'm sayin'
Whatever you decide, I'll still love you, baby
Cuz I've seen the top and it's just a dream

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
I can see the beloved and she's not alone
We're going down, down, down, if that's the only way
All that matter is the present, the here and now
Dance, shake it like a peckerwood.
Because you, oh you make me wanna do, oh everything
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Touch it and explode

Unless a man truly dies
People call me rude
"Get 'em! Take the pictures!"
Daddy Pop (oh Daddy)
If I was your one and only friend
If U can hang, U can trip on it

Maybe it's cuz
Two organ solos 2 go...
Aristocrats on a mountain climb
Don't talk if it's against the rules?

Soda fizzin' on the lawn
Don't let those bad boys catch u now
For the answers

Lay my cards on the table tonite
You had another lover and she looked just like you
All of this and more is for you

So she moved to Atlanta and she bought a blue car
Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
Strollin', strollin', we could have fun just strollin'
Talk of children still frightens me
We ask that U please observe the "No Letting Go" sign
Every day that you keep it away
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight
What the hell was that?
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem 2 care.
Take it from this sista, y'all take it from that
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
(Prince...)
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave
but he had grown accustomed 2 her style
See all the people wonder why
I'm goin' home.
We only want 2 have some fun (Have some fun)
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain
'Orion's arms are wide enough'
How you gonna make me kill somebody

This is 4 the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland
Yeah, homey, kick it just like that (go)

Money - how much'll make U happy?
Oh, lover! Yeah

I wish U love
[Feet stompin'!]
And I said, "No, are u?"
Let's go crazy

How can you just leave me standing?
That one's dedicated 2 all the lovers
We need a power structure that breeds production
Will peep this out, (yo, out)

That years after the contract you should
Baby, when your body's wet (body's wet, body's wet)
You know, I try so hard
Oh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight
Maybe 'bout the business u was worried
I never cared (didn't care)
She's just a victim of society
Who turn the mother out?
He tried so hard not 2 go insane
Joy, joy in repetition, joy in repetition

Say it, y'all
I felt much better so I went back
In someone else's box?
U got 2 shake something
And I'm able
When all I wanna do is wrong
Don't kiss the beast
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree
Cuz we got the baddest groove that we could a make
I feel for you - I think it's love
Love's kiss was running all thru my veins
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (Ya know he's too bold)

C'mon let me do ya like u want 2 be done
I need another piece of your ear
When U made love 2 me
Let's forget about the time (time)
Do do do do me baby
It feels so right
Love is there if you'd just open up 2 it.
Can't stop this feeling I got

It's gonna be a beautiful
The longer the time, (higher) the longer the time,
The dream we all dream of
On the one y'all say, housequake
I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
Better than the thieves in the temple
"I just gotta know... are we gonna try 2 love each other?"
Brother Lois should be around in a minute
Turning in your body's, psyche, dial a perfume that u like,
M&M killers playin' Mickey Mouse games
Just leave me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
My flow hits u just like a lead pipe
Please don't try 2 stop us

Which way do I turn when I'm feeling lost?
And I'm so scared
I've seen the future and it will be
Do U wanna play with me?
What I'm going to do
I want you now
Dr. Everything'll be alright
I can't tell you what she did to me
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain
Ready 2 scream (scream, now whatcha say)
When I suck U there
Don't fit in your video game
(Do that girl)
Let's pretend we're married and do it all night
Fightin' war
(help me)
(second coming) (Must be something in the water U drink)
I couldn't do you no better
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
U said u was funky
It's you, said it's you, I truly adore
U feel so wrong, be alone, if u just follow somebody someday]
Everybody dance (dance), music (music),
Stay awake 4 4teen hours
No shouting
Everybody can't be on top
Sure as there's a sun, (I'm gonna be the 1)
They killed my buddy, but I'm supposed to feel nothing (live 4 love)
Kid! Yo Kid!
Please, who do I look like baby?
Hoping she would answer back
You don't have to watch Dynasty
Just got 2, just got 2 - hit it
Why don't u just be happy, baby.
Giggle that U do?
What am I guilty of? Oh no (oh no)
That's when I gottcha that's when u mine
Boys and motherfuckin' girls ("319, 319" "Cool")
The most vital is what they say, more or less
U're so cool (Cool)
The max - More funk for your buck u can bet on that
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom..."
I hope it's somthing in it that's there 4 u
embrace (mama, u're all I want 2 know)
Tourists - 89 flowers on their back...inventors of the Accu-jack
A new jack in the pulpit
Will u love me for all time? (I'll love u 4 all time)
I was here long before U (Melody, Melody)
You're just as wet as the evening rain
