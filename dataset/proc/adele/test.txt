Let's go back there, back to the star
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
But how will you ever know if you never try
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Will he still love me even when he's free
(Steady as she goes) Steady as she go
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
So I, I turned around
I'll be better to you Time against us
And who are you hiding from?
What you thought
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Do tell me why you waste our time
'Cause it will never hurt
And I just want to make love to you
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Oh, little girl
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So wipe that dirty smile off
When the world seems so cruel
A kink
Your love, it is my truth
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
1 2 3 4.
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The morning rain, the morning rain
I'll be better to you,
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
That's it
I feel so down
(Steady as she goes) So steady as she goes Your friends have shown
Put a kiss on top of your head
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Until the end starts Come on and give me the chance
Or would it be a waste?
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Oh if only, if only you knew
Where does the time go?
But instead I fall back to my knees
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Let the sky come crashing down
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
But no matter
Do you love me?
Count your blessings to find what you look for
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
That is gathered round
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
And I see nothing in his eyes
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
You set me free, oh Send my love to your new lover
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And you left your mark and it never will fade
So watch them turn to dust
You'll never see me again
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
They make believe that everything
The last time Let it burn
What you see I see
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
You played it
So steady as she goes
And save me boy,
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
It could be something in the air I breath
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me
I can't bare to see the light
When we'll try to give it up
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
So overdue I owe them
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
'Cause I can't make you love me
We're willing to take the risk
You know my heart, more than I do
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
you would think that I was crazy,
I've known it from the moment that we met
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
Hustle...
Your teasing ain't enough
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
But I want you to be true
At skyfall [x2:]
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
Do you love me...?
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
It matters how this ends
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
You make it look like I'm see-through
Yeah Oh, people
Rollin' in the deep
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
It turns out it ain't enough
Turn down these voices
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
Fiasco, call it fiasco, fiasco
That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do baby is make your bread
And that scares me the most
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
He would be hard to chase
For breaking your heart
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
I get excitement in my bones
You hold me alright
But I want to live
A thousand miles and poles apart
When the thunder calls to me
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
We could have had it all
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
And I don't know why
Cuz I left that night
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
I was running, you were walking
You were supposed to guide me,
And they're all having babies
Tried my best
I find the less I look, more I find
Where I felt something die
Let the weight take me under
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
Take it as it comes
To the point
It illuminates all of my doubts
Don't pretend that you don't want me
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
You still sound like a song
Feel you here forever
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
When did it go wrong, I will never know
Plus he's there for you
But the more I do,
That I give in to my pretendings
You're like a dream come true
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
'til the morning!
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Love to you, ooh yeah
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
I know I'd never be me
You may have my number
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
There must be something in the water
I'm walking
Whenever I'm alone with you
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
and I don`t want you to see me,
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
Oh, and turned me off
Oh, anymore
You'll never know if you never try
Sure, she's got it all
And settle down
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
And on the highway of regret
When he shouldn't be
I know I left you speechless
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes
Depleted
I try to think of things to say
supposed to stay beside me
You close the door
Help me baby
Trust me I've learned it
Where I grew up and found my feet
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
And kiss me back to life to see
Their lipstick
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Take it all with my love
On your face
I've been learning to live without you
Lay me down (Won't you)
(I don't see you)
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
And be all you need so that you never want more
How do you keep me coming back for more
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Ticking by your call,
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
And it's been that way to long
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
(Steady as she goes)
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
It was just like a movie
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
You hang on every word I say
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Even if, it leads nowhere
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
I miss the air, I miss my friends
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
You may have my number, you can take my name
Trust me I've learned it So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
(Let the sky fall
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
Lose myself in time
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
In your heart I bring my soul
Baby I have no story to be told
And I'll do what's right
Feel the earth move and then
In hope that you find the missing piece
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
Just give me till then
When the night keeps you from sleeping
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
You will only be eternally
I gotta go
No final kiss to seal anything
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
I could hold you for a million years
That I call home
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
A friend
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down), umm
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
To when you were there
Is there anyone I could call?"
So stand beside the river you cried
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
And hold against me
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
I still feel your touch
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
Wanna try to testify in a... of happiness
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
I never lied and I never faked it
You disappear one day
There is so much space between us
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
So if you got
I could offer you a warm embrace
Neither up or down
