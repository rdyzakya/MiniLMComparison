We were sad of getting old
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
And have... for yourself
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
This train of thought will leave the statio
For everything that I've done
We had a date
With eyes that make you melt
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
But lately
I'll be better to you
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
Watch you wave
This is never ending, we have been here before
You are the peak and art of my universe
That was what you told me I'm giving you up
I love your precious heart I was standing
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Our love ain't water under the bridge
... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
When it crumbles
If you're not the one for me
Somebody smeared
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
Four cold walls without parole
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
Well, it felt something died
Be the best, have success,
I know this is love but If I tell the world
Rumor has it, ooh But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for You've been on my mind
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
After all we've been through
And the games you play
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
I miss you, I miss you
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
We both know we ain't kids no more If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
And lay yourself down.
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
And fly around in circles
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home
You know I'll always mean
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
But be delicate with my ego
If you don't
He will choose the poison over me?
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
Gonna understand Last night she said
And it's teasing me
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
"No and thank you, please Madam.
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
Baby, baby
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
You said I'm crazy,
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
Oh, they smeared it
Love to you, ooh baby
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
Just in case it hasn't gone
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes When you have completed
It's hard to understand just why
When I don't get nothing back
And there's many shades of black
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
(Just for you)
You're leading me astray
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
And you played it, to the beat
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
I heard that your dreams came true
You think we would and we do,
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
Face it all together Let the sky fall
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
You haunt me like a ghost
In every face that I've ever known
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
You're out of control with nobody around to help
I'm trying to tell you just how
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
We will stand tall
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
Deep down I must have always known
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Sweetest
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
And I think that I know things may never change
Lay me down (through the night)
I promise I'm worthy, mm
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
When I was young
If it hadn't been for love
I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
But if I
But like everything I've ever known
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
So stand beside the river I cried
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Though your kisses
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Let it burn Daydreamer
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Face it all together
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
You never seem to make it through the door
I wish nothing but the best for you two
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
And I will always love you
But go on and take it, take it all with you
And, boy, you're bringing me down
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
I must've called a thousand times
I wish I could live a little more
The night
You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
At sky fall Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
I don't care no more
Waiting as my heart drops
Help, help oh oh. Chorus:
Or don't you remember
Towards me from across the room
'Cause I love
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
As far as I'm concerned
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
The reason you loved me before
In the single life
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
So long to let my doubts go
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
No, girlfriends
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
You had to do
To care
And a part of me keeps holding on
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It's out of my hands
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
And pull me to the light
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
Pull me in, hold me tight
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
I should let you find me,
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
Had some bad love
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I heard his voice today
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
Something that it won't
Baby please remember me once more
That you are in my life
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
I can't wait to see the light
As much as it did then
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
Just take it, take it all with you
I've imagined it all
I grow fonder every day
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
Maybe we're already defeated
Turn down the bed
It is the world to me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
That we could fly
you might think that I wanna be close to you
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
You made me want you
Before we realized
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
(That is gathered round) Settle for a girl
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
But my knees were far too weak
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
I let my heart decide the way
And tell me no lies
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
Let it burn
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
You made me leave you
Heavens cried
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
(`cause you and me we`re good)
I quit I'm movin' on
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And lay yourself down!
Could describe him
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Miles between us
She is a stranger
Two worlds collided
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
Make a home down there
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
I turned around
Your grandsons
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You get excitement in your bones
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
Steady as she goes
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
To make me cry again
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I'm going back to where I started
We both know we ain't kids no more I was too strong you were trembling
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
See if I cry
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
I won't rise until this battle's won
On top of this
But I just wanna be drunk
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
People say crazy things
She had turned me off
We won't be making up
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
Even if it leads nowhere
(Sell it to the crowd)
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
North and South and East and West of your life
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Brushing past my every groove
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
Lay down with me
Waiting for a surprise
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Give me a memory I can use
I quit now
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
However long I stay I will always love you
Every place
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Just thinking of your face
You made a fool out of you
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
But now I give up
I ain't ever
You can say I chose to be alone
You drift into my head
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
A million years ago Looking for some education
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
Make up memories in my head
If you're ready, I am ready
Rumor has it, ooh,
Let's just say that maybe
You should know I chose to be alone
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
I still care
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
I know there is no tomorrow
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
At skyfall (Verse 1)
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
But as time goes on and my age gets older
There's so many shades of black
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
You're not already...
What I'll say is
They won't understand
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for Rumor has it, ooh
Keeping me from harm
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
Yeah there's many shades of black
I know I'll survive
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
I wanna step into your great unknown
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
That's not fair
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Feeling up his girl
through the ups and downs,
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
You make me feel like I am free again
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
All my life, you're my darkness
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
But he stays all the same
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
You get the people and the government
I will be, I will be
I miss my baby
I guess I still care
I don`t really wanna see you
He lends his coat for shelter
Bring the floor up to my knees
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes
But I've heard one on you
Can't say that it's been that great
Should I give up,
Don't have to tell you
You're still not mentioning love
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Inside my head Lay down with me
I forgive you once again
And me
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
(That is gathered round) So steady as she goes
Oh when you found that the one for you
And though I wish that you were here
All that bullshit conversation
You could help me ease my mind
You made a fool out of me
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
Boy I'm tired of trying
Other words are spring to me
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
Ooh I, I miss my baby I don't want you to be no slave
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
There's a fire starting in my heart
These final hours
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
Cause it was not said to you
Oh I, I miss my baby
So come on and give me the chance
I promise you will see
That you found a girl and you're married now
When we were younger and free
Nobody's perfect
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
It was just like a song
Did you ever make it out of that town
Turns me crazy,
(I`m not drunk enough)
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
Love to you, yeah
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
Too much to think
I find it funny that you're the only
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Don't feel so down
I met someone by accident
We've both know we ain't kids no more
It's the sweetest
An you showed up
... emolicious, for the shoot posses no... And you want me to respect you
Who wants to be right as rain
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
Yours too baby, come on now
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
That we might be exactly like we were
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
We will stand tall Where you go I go
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
Please don't fall apart
And you're my hope, you're my despair
He is a real lover
Everybody here is watching you
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
To tell you I'm sorry
I don't want you sad and blue
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
It was just like a song When we were young
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
Don't let go, baby give me light
Finally I can see you crystal clear
For just about fifteen
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Close my eyes
'Cause you feel like home
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Even though everything's a strain
Rolling in the deep
Yeah there's any shades of black
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
Lights go down, lights go down
He's willing to take the risk
That this would be inevitable
Feel you here, forever
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
I heard you've been missing me
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
All the things you'd say
I promise I'm worthy
And you played it to the beat
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
What you know is true
And leave me
It's better when something is wrong
To go over everything
Where worlds collide and days are dark
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
And we'll watch them turn to dust
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
But you're cold to the core
Can't have you the way
To say goodnight
Even when I've had too much,
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
Reminded by things I find
Are the wonders of my world
And there is no one there to dry your tears
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
And my back begins to tingle
Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
Build your world around me
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
I have only one request of your life
Are you ready, ready?
See how I leave with every piece of you
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
You were there
I don't want to keep you indoors
So... you then go calling
You told me you were ready
At skyfall Let the sky fall
That I never knew, never knew
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
I can't help feeling
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
Without me knowing
You had my heart inside of your hand
Send my love to your new lover
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
I say your name like there should be an us
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
When you don't
I can take a lot
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
I say we've only known each other one year
God only knows what we're fighting for
Oh, that you know
Darling
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
I quit
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
There is something in your loving
Fed up of biding your time
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
The reason you loved me before,
Your name When I lay with you
At skyfall This is how the story went
But I would never do you wrong
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
No one knows me like you do
In spaceships
Have I ever asked for much?
'Cause we all have wings
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
It was a great big lie
Don't need to think it over
You've found yourself
Lay me down
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
It's more than enough
For the big one, for the big jump
Hoping you'll walk through
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
I'll never say enough
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
Are the wonders of this world
And even then you don't get far
Lay me down (I can baby)
It only makes it harder baby
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
Which forgive you each time
Baby I'm so rising
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
If this ain't love, then what is?
They don't understand
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
I can't bear this time,
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
That knows you well
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Fool that I am
And make me crazy for you.
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood Feel blessed not impressed
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
I'll put my hands up
It's been waiting for you to open up
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I've been here before
See I can see that look in your eyes
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
Every word I've said
But after you that goes on
And the whole world is on your case
From the deepest part of my regret
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
Without the security
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
And though your hair
Everything you got
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
So stand beside the river I cried,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Waits for you
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Nobody knows it better than me
I'll be somebody different
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
So why don't we just play pretend
Walking with each other,
Is we can break every low
I can't give you what you think you gave me
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Round my hometown
Looking for some education
I want you to love me
And if I'm not the one for you
You must be mistaken
I'm heading straight for you
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Was all in place
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
And even in the dark
Are you steady now?
Lay me down (I can fall in)
I've cried my heart out
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
This love, it ain't over yet
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
The scars of your love remind me of us
As though you
To the way you move
I fall short each time,
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
'Cause I knew that that was
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
If I'm wrong I am right
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
But good to catch
I won't say a word
And, boy, she's bringing you down
By the glamour if you think you could. And you want me to respect you
God only knows why it's taken me
Sell it to the crowd
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
But they don't recognize me now
At the mention of my name
All of my life, I've been frozen
I want you to be my keeper
They can't look me in the eye
I'm gonna be alright
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
Hold your breath and count to ten
I could stay there, close my eyes
I don't want you to work all day
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
In case it is the last time
So desperately I try to link it with my head
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Without one dollar to my name
Say what's on your mind
And I threw us into the flames
Let it burn while I cried
When you don't, ooh don't
Even now when it's already over
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
I should leave the past behind me,
Seems I love the things you do
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
Reaching a fever pitch
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
From all my tears
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
But you pushed me in
You're the right kind of madness
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
It drags, as I lose my mind
Of when we were young When we were young
Let it burn while I cry
They've all been said before you know
I say we've only known each other a year
You make me feel like I am young again
There's something new inside my heart
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
But if by chance you're here alone
Just to make sure you're well fed
You can take my name
And a million miles Hello from the other side
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
Just look and you will see
Face it all together Let the skyfall
You'll always feel
Now you need a wife Steady as she goes
Who regrets the things they've done
If you're ready, if you're ready
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
Than I ever did you before,
And hold you tight
I have loved you all my life
I know some clothes you left behind.
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
Treat her better
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
Shows that we are united
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
I've changed my mind
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
Love to me, ooh baby
And miles between us
Everybody sees
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
I can't do it on my own
My God, this reminds me
Because I'm too crazy for you.
We both know we ain't kids no more
So I can tell you that I was wrong
When we spoke yesterday
And everyone agrees
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
One I never looked for
And neon lights and waiting papers
At least I can say that I've tried
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
And for what, and for what, and for what
It blew me away
In a quiet town Steady as she goes
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Devotion [Verse 1]
So let's go back there, back to the star
Live a simple life
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
Like a joke or a memory
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
I often think about where I went wrong
Darling this is goodbye Oh
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
Making memories using my eyes
At sky fall
How did it slow down, I go round and round
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
Every part of me
And that's exactly what I need to do
To hold in your arms
There is no simple
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
I need to get away to feel again
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
And they could never tear us apart We could live
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I'm trying to be brave
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Oh, honey
Lose yourself in time
At skyfall
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
It makes me reckless
I wish you'd come over,
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Then you'll get along Steady as she goes
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
When night comes and I'm on my own
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
Why do you love me
I know I'd never be me with out the security
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
But at least when you're at your worst
And as it fell you rose to claim it
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
Fill me
1 2 3 4
Even now when we're already over
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
You spin a web in every room
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
Every piece and part, you were the first
Is the subject of their talk
It feels like we're oceans apart
Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
You're the only one I want There will be times
Your name I set fire to the rain,
But it don't matter, it clearly
I'm willing to take the risk
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
I hope that you're well
Yes, I swam dirty waters
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
You can't make your heart feel
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Please forgive me, for my sins
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
The way I'm running, with you, honey
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! I heard that you're settled down
You made me tumble
When you'll just crumble back on down
Every time he ain't here
They were never true, never true
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco.
I don't even wanna waste your time
And no one had blame
This time you're on your own
Should I give up
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
Oh, baby
Put your hand in my hand
We were both right
You shower me with words made of knives
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
Rumor has it, ooh
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
Let this be the way we remember us
At the dawning of the day
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
Could've had it all
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
It's taken all of my stake
You set me free Send my love to your new lover
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
Just 'cause you heard it Rumor has it, ooh,
Ooh, ooh
Feel the Earth move, and then
But keep me making love to me
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
Never gonna leave you
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
Let me fall into your gravity
Or will he go back to the place where
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
Your name I set fire to the rain
And all I can do is watch and cry
It was dark and I was over
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
So overdue, I owe them
That I will be your remedy
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,
I've had some bad love
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Are you steady now? Steady as she goes I'm insane in the brain
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
And everything you do's a game
(Steady as she goes) Steady as she goes
You sound like a song
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You give up everything you are
(Neither up or down)
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
From the way you talk
She made your heart melt
It's like they're scared of me
And fall
My impatience will come out to play
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
Ooh
Learning to fly, learning to run
To stand in your arms
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't you piss me off, pretentious, ostentatious
I miss you when the lights go out
I've seen your face, under every sky
whenever I start to think about you
And if I stay I'll be alive
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
I want to feel my heartbeat so
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
And making up the past
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
At skyfall Where you go I go
Of stable glue Then you'll get along
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
Love to you, yeah And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
You say my name like there could be an us
No, we ain't kids no more I'm giving you up
Two hours late
Are you steady now? Steady as she goes
And face it all together
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
I will lay down my heart
I want you
All my words to hold
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco, fiasco
Looks good when he walks
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
It's been there for days on end and
That I can't adore
Standing there
You and your charm creep closer
Strips me down bare
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
So I
Don't come any closer
I've never known this, never before
so I can forget about you
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
Still how can you walk away
I see your face under every sky
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All that I have is on the floor
And your blood's
Everything just takes me back
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
I want you It's above and beyond me,
But if I hurt you
If that's love in your eyes
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
You're the only one
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
I've forgiven it all
This ain't lust
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Ye that's it baby
Like a bomb before explosion,
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
On that same old road that brought me here
'Cause I've been here before
Ye that's it honey
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
I will feel the power
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
No one has me like you do
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I feel like my life is flashing by
And be thankful when it's done
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
And since you're the only one that matters
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
Over every border and on every line
There's only one way down I'm giving you up
Can I have a moment
I hear the words I wish I'd said
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
When the day is done
It's already in your eyes
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
When night comes and you're on your own
It made us restless
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
Of my world, yeah
That the both of us
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make us grow from dust
I thought of me, I want to see
I won't face your fears
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
But some of us don't know why I
I gave you everything you never gave me
You make me feel like I am home again
But you won't
Made my way into the night
But when I call you never
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl
At least I know he's lying still
For a thousand years
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
That you and I are wrong
Of your loving arms
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
The heavens cried
When I feel left out
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
You know I'm never gonna leave you
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
When you're holding me Morning will come
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
How can I believer what I have?
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! Turn down the lights
Just hold me closly
I'm movin' on The other night
`cause you and me, we`re good
(Settle for a girl)
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
I was standing
You've had
I keep walking for miles But the people
Soaking up the sun
When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
'Cause we are living worlds apart
Time against us
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
Whatever it is, I depend on it
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
I don't regret a thing
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
Baby don't let the lights go down
But you'd save the best for last
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
They can't understand
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
It all, it all, it all
Then choke on words I'd always hide
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
If this is ain't love, then what is?
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
When we were young It's hard to win me back
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
Sitting on the sea
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
I know this for sure
you came along and changed my mind
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
No, you won't
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
It had only just begun but now it's over now
Rollin' in the deep...
I'll be better for you This is the end
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
And he could change the world
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
But that was a million years ago
And the things I think just don't make sense
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
I could stay there
Nobody told me that you'd be here
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
As you tear your way right through me
That I can give you all the loving in the whole wide world All I want you to do is make your bread
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
I will always love you
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
I kept my distance so you would be free
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
Turn all my right to wrong
Even in the daylight when you think that
The love you don't feel
I can't drown in your tears
You said my name in the dead of glory
I can't face your breaking heart
I wish nothing but the best for you
My friends got their ladies
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
So darling
Life was a party to be thrown
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
Before I go?
He can't do it on his own
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
Closer and near
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Throw your stone through every open door
You and I have history
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
I must my way
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
1 2 3 4. Fiasco, fiasco [Chorus:]
Then sees you through There's no way I
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Is exactly what it seems
And I swore you moved overseas
Watched it pour as I touched your face
They don't know you like I do,
Of my world
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
You say I've known you longer my dear
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Whole minutes now
Excuse me first love, but we're through
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Out that door Well, I've been in town
Your love drives me crazy
When we were young
There is nothing you can't do
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Please stay where you are
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
Feel the pain running through my veins
There's so many ways to act
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
You're the only one I want
Than you ever did me before.
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
Well, it burned while I cried
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Made my way into the sun
Rumor has it, ooh All of these words whispered in my ear
Just take it all, with my love
Ooh the people I've met
You don't seem
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
That finally feels like home
Ooh In the absence of security
'Cause then I don't see
I need to fight my own
Hitting me like an explosion
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
Steady as she goes Settle for a girl
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
At sky fall Let the sky fall
Don't try to change my mind
You know I know just how you feel
We both know we ain't kids no more Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
Only wanted for you to save me
I didn't know a single word he said
Don't need to look no further
I made my way into the night
So that's it baby
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising), umm
All I ever will recall of my life
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Let it burn [Adele]
Memories are fresh
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Filling up my heart with golden stories
And have you tell me
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
Someone else
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Think of me in the depths of your despair
What you do
Every feeling, every word
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
We both know we ain't kids no more If you're ready, if you're ready
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I'd always kiss
I hid it in the seam of your coat
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
