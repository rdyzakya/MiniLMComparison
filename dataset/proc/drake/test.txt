When you get hurt by the one you living for,
And they did put me on, yeah
Yeah but you know how that shit go
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
And that just didn't sit right with you
Sacrificing things
They wanna mash it up, whoa
Baby, it don't take you nothing to move me
What's my name, what's my name I heard you good with them soft lips
Looking for things you can find
Texting my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
Are you down for the cause? Are you down?
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
And more chune for your head tops
You just stuck standin' there
But I've been drinking so much
Skrrt [Intro: Moodymann]
When me tune drop, the girls, they bounce along
Or they go to Georgia State where
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
Way, way, way up
I hate a rapper especially
'Cause that night I played her three songs
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
With the people that I won't forget
That can only mean one thing
I just been plottin' on the low
Damn, I'll be gone till November
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
She cock it up on the private flight
Should we ever need it
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
Hey hi how ya dern?
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
Ima go 'n get some head off the strength of my music
Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop
You act so different around me
I pray to make it back in one piece
That's when they smile in my face
Everyone just wait now
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
And its all becase you chose a side
Champagne range
Woo, they got me feeling like the one again
Get to shakin' somethin' cause that's what drumma produced it for
If I die, all I know is I'm a motherfuckin' legend
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Lucky that you stayed on
She rode it like a soldier

They know, they know, they know
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Season opener basketball game
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
I should want to go back to the one I started with
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
Yeah, like there it is there man, hoo
Sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah-nah
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback

Used to chef KD
Mr. K.F.C, V.V'S is in the watch
Way too many questions you must think I trust you
Nobody makes it from my ends
And now were meeting out end And it's all because you chose a side
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
Tryin' to think of the right thing to say [Hook: Jorja Smith]
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
I caught that whole play
Clubbing hard, f***in' women ain't much to do
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
This is more than just a new lust for you Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
So I can say it to your face
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Fuckin right, all right

I ain't tryna chance it
I still the feel the same
I knew a couple of your friends way before
You da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
I keep thanking you, just don't know
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
For me to move on and succeed
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it
So button up your shirt straight
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
Halloween
Money flowin' like a slit wrist no bandage
Please don't forget me! I won't soothe your pain
Ho oh (goin' home) (Hold on, hold on)
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest, y'all keep talking 'bout who next
I see you doin' well, baby
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
You wanna grip Benz wheel
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
So you're the only one Oh ooooh, trust issues
I love you through everything
Money not a problem, you can finger trace it
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
Feels like when you gettin' to that paper hip hop hates ya
Hold on, hold on, fuck that. Fuck that shit. Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute. Fuck that shit. Still on this mothafuckin' record. I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all. Aye, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better. [Verse 1]
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart. Ooh na na, what's my name
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical, yeah
The passion and the flame is ignited,
Gotta come through quick, quick
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
How many more days could I wait?
Call up your girl and put them heels on
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Roxx got a case but they get off again
My down bitch, one who live by the code
I don't let it get to me Done
I ain't tryin' look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah
There's more than life than sleeping in
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
I knew you before you made ends meet
And I know you can't wait
I can't trust no fuckin' body
Only gets worse when you know things
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Janes Flower
360 with the wrist, boy
But all for nothing Im afraid to say, [Chorus] [Drake]
Blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Shoutout to Tiffany's Stephanie
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
I had some different priorities
Your eyes them looking at me
Call me when there's no one there,
I could never ever let the streets down
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
Damn right, all right (And we say) Hell yeah
It's hard to stay away
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
You don't need no one else
I got all these fucking whips and ain't got no payments Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
That's really how you feel?
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey Workin' Monday night
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
I reach back like one, three
Uh, trying not to over think
I don't wanna fight it I figure out you, you figure out me
I'm with all the dawgs
The shit was gettin' too predictable
All the rappers that you vouch for
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby I am the topic of conversation
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer I got all exotic bitches you gon' think I'm racist
This year I'm eating your food
And I won't let 'em fall through
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uhh, But I guess things change
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
Tell me
Me, I'm just done in the hype
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
I was paying momma's rent was I turning 17
Oh oooo oooo oooo ooh Oh yeah, oh yeah
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything
As we proceed. Uh, 5 and a half and boys
It's too late for my city
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
After my session, she came over
Hussle Started from the bottom now we're here
Always saw you for what you could have been
I was only gone for the last few months
Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'
This song's for you
Ain't no tellin' Yeah okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
And I don't sit still I keep it movin' like a drive-by
I can't blame you, no, no [Outro]
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace
I wanna benefit from the friendship
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
I'm not someone you should trust I know
But we ain't even trippin' I'm goin' in
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
That's why you take me,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga I'm off this, man This shit was all I knew
Uh, but here goes nothing Aston Martin music, music
But my mind didn't change
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
They don't want me to give you nothing
Hope you can see the difference
I hope you can take it I'm too good to you
And it didn't help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Where, where, where, where
In my two-seater, she the one that I will take Bobbin' to the music
Chi-town chi-town Michael Jordan just said text me (woo!) Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Tell me how the f-ck we supposed to stay friends
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Yeah!
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
What you bothering me for?
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"
Until enough is enough
I don't have to worry because everything ours,
Yeah, yeah Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Higher powers taking a hold on me You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
Watch the way I handle it, uh
I will have a model wife
That's my nigga
To get what I want tonight? Ain't no tellin'
Chicks get hammered
It's gon' take some getting used to
And say I love you too But I need someone different
Old number, so it bounce back
But I could never love her
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 4]
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
You know, years ago they had the A&R; men to tell you what to play
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
If we smoke a spliff, have a drink me and you
The club owner supply it
She said they love me unconditional
Put the world on our sound
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Momma say it if the rules ain't bent don't bend em'
What they got to say now?
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
I been at the house taking no calls
You the da best I ever had,
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
We don't even know what we done to you
So much on my plate now
Starboy, call me number one
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Most people in my position get complacent
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey Club goin' up
And pray for winter
I put my hands around you
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
A strong one Two white cups and I got that drink
Wanna make you my lady officially
Tryna sell these story I don't even open up the package
Got some head last night and it was outstanding
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
I don't wanna spend time fighting
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments
Baka
Like everyone I know I just been drinkin' on the low
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
All of my let's just be friends
Tell Tune "light one, pa** it like a relay"
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
Anyone will take shots at you, yeah
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Yeah Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog
(That's just what I heard)
You won't ever have to worry,
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
I hate a goofy especially
I'm tired of all of these hoes
That person has it all
Like twenty-four seven, that's where my life took me
The feds tryna clip us
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came,
Pain can make you wanna love no more, [Chorus]
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
Now and forever, I'll bring it home That's what they doin' Cameron,
I made my own style, I don't think that I should stay

What's the point in even trying
But give all I have to you and
No help, that's all me, all me for real Money on my mind, you should think the same, J's on, pinky ring

To do what I had to do

And we can do the things we never got the time to
I guess being right takes too long
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
I've been waiting way too long long long long
They got to go, they got to go

New friends all in their old feelings now

You niggas move like the one-two, yeah [Hook: Jorja Smith]
I hit the Ginobili with my left hand up like woo

Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
Haven't left the condo for a week now 10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man

Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,

Versace my clothes while I'm selling them bows
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
I had to knock down the wall
Bounce that shit like, woah, yeah
You would think I planned it
A reality living in the matrix
Tracking device on your used 5 series
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that 'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
Baby, come closer Too mix up in drama to go outside
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot

Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance

When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
"Are you drunk right now?" I'm just sayin', you could do better
I just don't understand it I don't know how to talk to you
Make sure the plane got a phone now
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't need science to proof
I just don't understand it Years go by too fast
I need a boy to take it over
Fuckin' right, all right
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
I give you my fortune
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
This is a gated community
Everybody knows and I feel left out
I used to know you back when you was young
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
She say she hate that she love me
Drapes closed I don't know what time it is
She call me the referee cause I be so official
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl
Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh Well I get paid every 24 hours money and the power
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
You know what it is if you heard drake
Follow my steps
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city I know you've been hurt by someone else
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Look (Drake: Verse 1)
Fresh out the store but I'm not out the cleaners
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Why you always touching road

Kill you in the kitchen
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
She says I know you changed, I never see you

But if the devil's in the details then I'm satanic
You hit it right on the nose
When I go to sleep, I dream Versace
Started not to give a f*** and stopped fearing the consequence
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
We smoked out with no roof on it
You would swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
Ooh na na, what's my name Ooh na na, what's my name
And they sold you one
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems

Makin' hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Just me and my boss
You shouldn't speak on me, period

Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
You tried to give 'em your side of the story
And since you picked up I know he's not around (Are you drunk right now?) I'm just sayin', you could do better
Please, one at a time
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
So many lonely sleepless nights,
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble This is all God's doing man you can't plan it
You say it's guaranteed
You know the game is so separately
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,

Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
[Hook]
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
I'm not patient
Got money to blow C-M-B baby
Ask you to please excuse my table manners, I was making room for the table dancers
Iced up, my day slow
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
Oh you fancy huh? Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
I'm just doin' me and you could never understand it
Much closer 10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
You was in the zone
Please come outside the house and show yourself
I was young and I was selfish
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Any more henny and you're past the limit
But you know I always handle that one my way
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
Step up to the target,
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
Who is your replacement?
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like Bleu DaVinci
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
Knows how to work my body
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Bout Take over your city and you can't stand it
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping in to your emotions
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
They cannot fuck with the legacy
With the indian tracks
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
You boys just started
We can make them look like bozos,
I tell 'em if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, Last name ever,
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Your actions make us doubt you
I be at my table stackin' dollars till the perfect height
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend
My plug, he John Gotti
She's just a little too perfect
Oh you fancy huh? Nail done, hair done, every thing did
Them boys up to something they just not just bluffing Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Used to sleep inside a den I got acres now
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that
Hidden hills where I post
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
Want her all my life
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Call your number and it's out of service
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
I did it all for you
It feels like the only time you see me
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event, oh
Me come clean like me come inna me video
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it, Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I'm a dog
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Wave 'em at the bitches hating on you with they friends
The ones you never bring around me
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh you at the club? Cashin' out with everything
Boy, Versace, Versace
They did put me on
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
Yeah, like controlla, controlla Baby I'm very happy, whine up your sexy body fi papi
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto
And I wanna tell you my intentions
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Spillin' while I'm sippin'
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
Man I told my city I'd be gone 'til November, then November came
And it's all because she don't want things to change So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
Cause you don't say you love me
Straight to the top, rooftop close
Looking for a guy to put in work-a
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
I got more style than stylists
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
And ooh soft your loves desire
Nothin' they can say now
House party up the road, yeah
Can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Yeah, like controlla, controlla Fuck bein' on some chill shit
Look like you hidin' your problems
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, nigga you already know
Fbgovo, hundred percent, yeah
Is now white clouds
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
It's just apparent every year
I give you the business
Fuckin' right
Voice baritone, haters carry on
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I think there's something
A statement or something
I can't blame you, no, no
You know they all sentimental now
Told me everything about you
Shit'll never be the same
I came up, you changed up
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I think I'm the don, but no Rocco
