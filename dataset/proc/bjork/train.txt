You cannot answer Why this sacrifice
Gloomy Sunday Dear Gene,
They're smoking cigars
I will meet you I'm so impatient
Where is it? Possibly maybe probably love, possibly
To want more would be greed
And while you're away,
She's five years old Threads worms on a string
I'm simply suggesting We go to the hidden place
When will I get my cuddle?
Let me push you up against me tightly
And a compass wouldn't help at all
I'm using lipstick again
You can always review on your own little screen
I've seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
Get over I see
I simply remember my favourite things
I didn't know you had it in you
It's getting boring
Thvi thad sst ekki stari mey. - Since there is no sweeter girl. I'll pick you
I have seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze I've seen a man killed by his best friend
With our feet marching
Possibly maybe probably love Electric shocks?
Right above our heads While we're asleep
(Crystalline) and demand the lights (Crystalline) internal nebula
I'm gibberish
By the time I stop waiting I miss you Black night is falling
In our hands Well,
Five fingers
It's coming up It takes courage to enjoy it
Ohrwaaa
Embrace, you tight, let's unite, tonight I thrive best, hermit style
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Again... I lie in my bed,
Are steeped
To not want them humans around
And the Empire State What else was a sigh
Owah, owah, owah
That happen
For my emotional stance
In wonder - I wonder
Was it something like this I wished for
Came down and gently picked my adrenaline pearls
A handshake
Invents a charm
One day, one day
And see the sun come up We could nick a boat
Spread out like my fingers (Crystalline) internal nebula
We'll stay in a hidden place Oh, in a hidden place
Er thnum fadmi fr
I called the police
Relentless restlessness
Before it's too late
There is too much
It's absolutely gloomy Sunday
In a generous mode
In the sky
Every time we lose our voices
March Stirring at water's edge
And put me in my place Mmm mmm mmm mmm Generous palm stroke
And I do faults I do confess
Quietly ecstatic It's not meant to be a strife
So when you come back
How Scandinavian of me En-cha-le-li
Og fyrr en mig vardi, - Before I knew it
(Right above our heads)
I'm the hunter, I'm the hunter
But it hasn't happened yet
The man you will marry, the home you will share To be honest, I really don't care You've never been to Niagara Falls? I have seen water
I swallow warm glowing lights
It's in our hands One hand
And sneak off to this island
Like rain, out of the blue When my life is through
It's water, that's all The Eiffel Tower
March
hn er sorglega stygg, - She's hard to get -
I play dead
lysti upp gamli gtusld, - Lighting the old trail
Curling up inside my private tortures
And it hungers for union
Yeah! You could smell it
I'll bring back the goods
Feel the speed We are the earth intruders
til Lna hanns er beid. - To Lina awaiting him
Pipes up an organ
At one step at a time now baby, baby
Every morning I walk towards the edge
To be safe up here with you Safe up (here with you) I miss you
Their fru ad skjlfa, - They'd shiver
You're the bird on the brim
I will, grown my own
thar gladleg Lna std. - There Lina gaily stood
Henh-yeah, yeah Don't get angry with yourself
Blueberries, dancers in line
It's obvious
Ow, ow, ow
Before you wake up
We are the earth intruders We are the earth intruders
Did you understand Appreciate
Ohtuuuuekeah
My mind in whirls
Even horses laugh
Crystals grow like plants (listen how they grow)
Embraces my insides,
But you won't notice 'Til after five years
'Cause my chord is calling
And throw little things off
To touch with but careful, careful There lies my passion, hidden
all Remember what I have said
What are you doing here?
A few kisses ago I remember you
Lottery or car crash
g lrdi i bernsku, - I learned quite early
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill It's warmer now lean into it
And he makes me want to hurt myself again And he makes me want to hurt myself again While you are away
You're trying too hard
This aeroplane of ours gracefully,
og thad sst ekki stari mey. - And there is no sweeter girl
Ferocity
Warm glowing oil
It will all make sense One day
A way to start the day I go through all this
Or what is more important
But after a while I wonder
I'm in love
To complete the mission
But what they are It's not up to you
I am beyond me
Possibly maybe probably love, possibly How can you offer me love like that?
Only before you I go humble I should be arrested
Hawks and sparrows race in my waters
Skskskskksksks
Where's that love you promised me?
Unison
En lknrinn var sttur, - The doctor was fetched
Break the charm All the modern things
Giving urban a farewell
Ohh-er-him
and that's all We live on a mountain
Who you are
There's a beautiful view
Can't sit on me there
Whether sailing into nature's laws
Doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles
Unnendum er mninn kr, - To sweethearts the moon is dear
Gjafir flugu um allt Flestum gekk vel ad gripa sitt
Who you are now
And a parrot on each side
The light and the dark the big and the small
You just can't handle
Just keep in mind you need no more at all You've seen what you were and know what you'll be
You
Behind the skin
May I or should I or have I too often All my body parts are one
Kun mina vien sen markniniolle
I am so sorry
..
To form a mutual core This eruption undoes stagnation
the choir is quiet
A delayed reaction
I'll be yours I weave for you
Ah huh huh huh How could I be so immature
Forcing yourself into pain like there is no tommorow?
And so close to
The beauty in her
Suggests
They've just been waiting
Trying to match our continents
It's all there
I love them!
of course you are here
Respect her spatial needs
Well, it never really was
You just did what you had to do Time, it takes a tear to fall
She surrendered
Me
Nana na na na, Nana na na na
But yet so, yet so irresistible and me and my fear can
Deep inside of me, oo-oohh
Let's unite, tonight
Domestically, I can obey
Initiate a touch
To share me
Look no further
and what ails the state Your grandson's hand
Supposed to happen,
Gladur ndi g fljtt mitt
Like me
the choir is so quiet
When you conquer anxiety I live by the ocean
Down to the bottom
How it sparkles
remember, wrap up the bread
The missing elements in me
Fail at creating a flow then realign the whole
Then all of a sudden, turn happy and they and my here after
You don't have to speak
With our hearts
All neon like The cocoon surrounds you
Give yourself in
My darling is beautiful
Prime runs through me
Equalize the flow
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
When you and I have become corpses Let's celebrate now
I gave to you Mmm mmm mmm mmm So needy of comfort
To peak
I can feel it And the beautifulness
They've just been waiting in a mountain
You own me : I'm yours Mmm mmm mmm mmm You have to trust it
My mother and son baked for me During the night
stari mey, - Such a sweet girl
When you're up to it The atmosphere
You will go astray
Then spare you from that burden (It's gonna be hard)
Like a killer whale
And I don't want to find it again
And sows a bird in her knickers They, they're smoking cigars
Human behavior, human behavior
I am why Your sweat is salty
Till my thighs
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
After you kneel on me
Complete
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
The sun is gone to bed
You can't handle love You can't handle love, baby
Thad er sorglegt fyrir sidprda mey - It was sad for such a nice girl
This eruption undoes stagnation
umm thau tfraljma slr. - Around them falls its magic light
Moon will guide me through, baby
As you should sleepy head
A rose to grow a thorn
Get any better
My sweet adversary
Explode this body
I'm in love again. I lie in my bed
Private branch of this tree You gardener, you discipliner
I never thought I would compromise
Ohhh!!
To shut yourself up
Every time I lose my voice
But wouldn't recognize you yet And if you believe in dreams
Hann b√≠tur mig
mamma - gaman vri ad vera str
To the town's best baker
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic to human behavior
But oh, to get involved in the exchange of human emotions
and now there's nothing to fear Oooh, I should have known
A place called hate
Thvlkt hnoss! - Such luck!
You're exhausted, come lay down
I.. I'll.. I'll give you some strawberry cake!
Is too exhausted And if you complain once more
And say, undo
You didn't know, you didn't know What you resist persists
(vaik' on kaitaluinen) English:
Grinding skeptics into the soil Shower of goodness
Morbid trenches Here come the earth intruders
So broken,
We won't save you
To be safe up here with you It's real early morning
Maybe not from the directions
State of emergency
I wake people up
All is full of love! All is full of love, all is full of love
Come on, hurry I killed your bill You have to hurry up
And chain of flowers Come to me, I'll take care of you
Smittens me with hope Possibly maybe possibly maybe
Mamma - g vil koma til thn
And then I don't feel so sad Come on girl
Secret for you to hear
Anymore Get over that sorrow, girl
You have to trust it Maybe not from the sources
And the day feels a-broken
Unexplained on your collar
Her nature bowed her head
Marching March
I give myself up
Sksksksksksk
I'll keep it in a hidden place
On her own she is human
Aren't we trying too hard? 'Cause it's in our hands
You count the centuries, I blink my eyes
Hypnotized by the Whirl Drink me, make me feel real
A few kisses ago I remember you,
Howwwooooooooeeeeeee
You remember
En-mi-sshh... Ooh
My best souvenir
Lives a creature called lust
Let's unite tonight Let's unite, tonight
And once again be reborn (All birthed and happy)
Our love, our love,
Every nerve that hurts You heal
thvi Lna sagdi "J". - For Lina answered "Yes" Thad lenti drtti, - It was quite a delay
You hid the key to our continuity
He knows how many freckles she's got
Every time I feel a hoarseness
You're trying too hard It's not meant to be a strife
Wa wa wa wawawawa
I'll heal you With a razorblade
Revive my wish
thvi hn var svo gskid grey. - But then she's such a slender sort
Not a threat in sight
We'll have to make new love When your eyes
With you, dozen a day

Are aleeeyha
Owowowowowowowahhhh Finnish:
We'll be in a hidden place
From my hibernating On the surface simplicity
In pieces,
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you Gloomy Sunday
Let's sneak out of this party
Hej huulia hillallaa!
So I can feel happier
Follow the dot
There's more to life than this But then we'd have to rush back
And hurting stops It's sometimes just like sleeping
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill You're trying too hard
These are a few of my favourite things Girls in white Dresses with blue satin sashes
So clearly
That will make her shine
Undo It's not meant to be a strife
That's all the time is needed
Soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, I know
Std tpt svo hann valt mamma- th ert elskuleg mamma mn
This wasn't supposed to happen! Yet i'm, yet I'm the same
Kahi
For your nest, for your love
And two suns ready
I awake and I find you asleep and deep in my heart dear
To get the first bread of the morning
But it's not up to me
My heart is so broken,
Silver White winters that melt into springs
I've seen the dark
I'm your one way street I'm a whisper in water
Oh, you
Undo if you're crying Undo
Touches
I could bring my little ghetto blaster
Your love was sent to me
As this is where I'm staying
Undo Train-whistles, a sweet clementine
To change seasonal shift
og min sngrdd var sweet and gay. - And my song was sweet and gay
One for each that you take
That said, "I love you too
To fill you up with power,
That made my dreams come true
And I can smell a pinch of hope
Henh-yeah, henh-yeah The soft distortion
A heart to miss a beat
(Crystalline) and demand the lights It's the sparkle you become
To counteract distance
og thiy kalla mig gleym-mr-ei. - And boys call me Forget-Me-Not
(oh)
So much of me Let's unite tonight
I have to go through this
You know there's nothing I'd love to do more
And you push me up to this State of emergency
Every pearl is a lynx, is a girl
We are the sharp shooters
Only before you I'm humble I go humble
Game we're playing is life
If travel is searching
To show me your palms I'm so bored with cowards
J√°, hann kemur me√∞
And then I'll nurse you, I'll nurse you I'll protect you You know that I adore you
Leave me alone Possibly maybe possibly maybe
Explode
I'm in rapture
How beautiful to be Your flirt finds me out
Surrender
I'm puzzling. Here I go

Human behavior, human behavior And there is no map

Will I complete
Anyway It's not up to you

The fingers I was given

Something important

Eran tibble err
In a ball of yarn He'll never return it
hver strkur mig stardi, - Every boy would gaze at me
It stops the hurting
And when you'll get older later
Now she's poisoned by demands
But, I told
Is ever so, ever so satisfying and they and my here on
Marching We are the earth intruders
Stampede of resistance
Goes out of the window and up on the roof.
I will meet you I was peaking
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
Love me Let's celebrate now
I cried a river over you Look no further
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
he√∞an-bi√∞ur,
And undo
My eyes wide open
The innocent are dreaming
Forming a mutual core This eruption undoes stagnation
A new world, a new day to see I'm softly walking on air
A simple excuse Nana na na na, Nana na na na
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill I'm praying
You'll wake up
You've seen it all there is no more to see Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens

And during the night

(All birthed and happy)
Have always existed
ad blikka finni ensku, - To speak proper English
For the right moment
With a beard, and a pipe
They lie in the bathtub
I'm the branch that you break
I suck my tongue
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule
And arms rolling
Offending yourself,
Let me see who you are One day
Of the magnetic strife
I keep calm admiring your lava
Into my wide open throat I have a recurrent dream
(to be a life)
I dare you, I dare you Like a virus needs a body
But something huge is coming up
Of my flesh
The hardcore and the gentle Big time sensuality
I knock on your skin, and I am in The perfect match, you and me
Be closed or open? I go through all this
I don't believe this,
If you ever get close to a human and human behavior
I miss you
mninn ofar skyum hl,- Moon smiled above the clouds
Seek solace
Look no further It's in our hands
Sleepyhead
There's more to life than this There's more to life than this
Naked man, naked man, come down.
and I'm coming over
My heart comes undone
Or where to put it I'm so close to tears
Sometimes Possibly maybe probably love
Foetus-style And they will assist us
Nana na na na, Nana na na na Scolanscolan
The Atlantic ridge drifts
The thrill of them all
og sgdu vid sig sjlfa, - And say to themselves
We'll have to make new love While you are away
Ooooh ... If living is seeing
Yet I'm ? ? ? ? ? ? Underneath our feet
Trying to run ahead of that,
Burning under your feet
Probably maybe possibly love, possibly Mon petit vulcan
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you? Gloomy Sunday Gloomy Sunday, with shadows I spend it all
You can't handle I dare you
From the top of the mountain
hann var damla svefni, - When he spoke in his sleep
Shelter you from that pain (Just to make it easier on you)
Wonderful, I'm joined with you Wanderlust, wanderland Can you spot a pattern (Relentlessly restless) Can you spot a pattern

I receive its embrace
Mr finnst gott ad koma til thn
I'm back at my cliff
Of the ones we love
They pulsate and wake me up
You'll meet an army of me His wicked
Married to myself
Flickering sun-flame.
Not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
Comfort and protection (I'll watch over you)
I'm gonna keep it to myself This time
It will all come true One day
Coming to end the doubt pouring over
Slowly unravels
Living by herself In a heart full of dust
Th vildi g stjrna bdi hljmsveit og kr Excuse me
I say
Or will I want more Lust for comfort
You are the one who grows distant
For being so untrue
Vaik' on kaitaluinen Hej huulia hillallaa!
The sun has gone to bed
Through some voltage
S√≥lin sekkur
I didn't know you had it in you This eruption undoes stagnation
Protect you, calm, calm down
It's pagan poetry
You're eruptions and disasters
As you should sleepyhead
Fail at loving and fail at giving
Right above my bed While I'm asleep
That hangs on the third branch from a star,
Venus as a boy He believes in a beauty
Craving miracles My romantic gene is dominant
You see
So accurate He sets off

It mustn't
Stari mey, - Such a sweet girl
Its habitants seem too keen on god
Fragilest still strong

Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Almost
Who are you? I know by now that you'll arrive
We just met
She knew what you needed
Totally still,
With your wishful thinking
Shuffling of columns
That we go to the hidden place
All continuity
Of sea-girls

And drop my anchor
Therefore we are
I feel you compress her
Our love
You'll meet an army of me
Unison Why can't you give her room

It could still happen How do I master
From whose hands deeply humbled
I belong to here where

Muddy with twigs and branches
It's me and truth
Og piltarnir their skjlfa, - And they shiver
If things were done your way
I conquer claustrophobia (crystalline)

How beautiful to be Emotional landscapes
In the core of the earth (listen how they grow) Crystalline internal nebula (crystalline)
Although she is slender When I take her to the market

These are a few of my favourite things Cream coloured ponies and crisp apple strudels

You've got to manage
Like me My name Isobel
Right at the top
I'm at home with truth alone Not 'til you halo all over me
You have done good for yourselves
And she gave it to you
You are gonna have to find out for yourself (Ah huh huh huh)
And lives that were over before they were spent I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
Destroy all that is keeping you down
We'll have to make new love He'll never return it
There's more to life than this Black night is fallen
Only with you
All the moments you should have embraced
Moon will guide me through
Living by herself When she does it she means to
It's home
Self sufficiency please!

You didn't know, you didn't know Darling stop confusing me

I listen to the sounds they make
Crystallizing galaxies

You know that I love you
And that is enough
They listen into the weather
It's not up to you If you wake up
It's not up to you There is too much
I shall tell them I remember you Oh, you
Only before you I go humble I'm queen of provocation
Trapped in a bay I'm a path of cinders
Embrace you tight
I'm the hunter
Craved Waves irregularly striking
Didn't you know?" I remember too
(Crystalline) I conquer claustrophobia
You're so curiously pure
A blueprint
The tide will show you the way
But now I can't do this without you I never thought I would compromise
And will
Feeds you honey, heals you Don't get angry with yourself
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This is my home I live by the ocean
Sparkling
The Earth (like the heart) leans back in it's seat
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm I'm so
And just to prove you do
One day As the lukewarm hands of the Gods

I dare you
It stops the hurting You can have me
Glowed the tiniest spark
Undo this privacy
In my mouth
I'll play the fool
As he plays with your hair To be honest, I really don't care I've seen it all
To forgive You are forgiven
Possibly maybe probably love Uncertainty excites me
Don't get angry with yourself
My sweet adversary Get over the sorrow, girl
How beautiful
Hides in the air Can I hide there too
No light no air to live in
Look no further Cruelest
All the love above
All is full of love, all is full of love I'm a fountain of blood
When I take her to the market
Don't, don't get angry with yourself
The world is always going to be made of this You can trust in it

Woo-ooh
Necessary voodoo And the beast
How beautiful to be
The hugest of hugs
Accidentally, you seduced me,
he√∞an-li√∞ur-afte-care
Flock of parashooters
As the protein transmutates
We could go down to the harbor
You open up, say welcome Like a flame that seeks explosives
When you're ready
You have poured yours
But I haven't met you yet
All of your rules
Around the volcano
Glow in the dark threads
That you are yourself a light-bearer,
They puzzle me
And there is no map uncertain They're terribly, terribly, terribly moody of human behavior
I am why I am strong in his hands
After you
You just ain't receiving
And I sense
Its all the time that's needed
Underneath all currents
Into our wide open throats I have a recurrent dream They make me feel better
Fills you up
All the moments you should have not locked up Understand
Off me Woo-ooh
May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
With the last breath of my soul, I'll be blessing you Gloomy Sunday Dreaming, I was only dreaming
On their way down
Against darkness In the sleeping curves
there's no violin
In remembrance of you Pedaling through
Sometimes
When she left her craft voluntarily
Howweeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Wind stern in my face
Dig bones out of earth
All is full of love
And leap into
Serious comfort
I know you gave it all
All loveless I dare you
I adore how you simply surrender to high And your lungs
I remember
en seinna sagdi hann feginn. - But then he said, relieved
My heart's burned
And the littleness of his movements Hides himself
Oh just for you I can feel it
How extremely lazy of me How could I be so immature

Been practised for millions of years,
Undo if you're sweating
The hardcore and the gentle Big time sensuality In a forest pitch dark
sjnum alltaf hlfur, - His time at sea half-drunk
do this, do that, make your bed This isn't the last song
And if you complain once more

I'm waiting for you, I'm starving for you My sweet adversary
In volume of her glow
It's growing silently,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
Over
Moon will turn me on I just don't care anymore
And take over
Your turtleheart And they will assist us
Until we get to the core Did I imagine it would be like this
Of the pleasure
Ah huh huh huh huh
Seem so lioness fire heart, passionate lover And afterwards
From above Mmm mmm mmm mmm I turn myself in
Craving miracles No one imagines
Seeeeeooheeeee

My love Isobel
Sanctuary In the hidden place
Crooked
I won't sympathize
Ideedeedoo yehaaa
And loved them still
Until they're in the sky
A new world, a new day to see A divorced lady arrives home from a bar,
Told me love was through with being
Right in the eye of the hurricane
Woah Gling gl, klukkan sl, - Tic toc, the clock chimed
I'm going hunting
If you'll live that long
Like cars and such
Your rescue squad
When you conquer anxiety
En vestur landi, - But while out west
Listening to the irritating noises
Arousal
Caress every ache I play dead
Fingers
Dark and divine
It's all here

And I'll never know
en mamma dan dreymdi mig draum um thig
I am above
We wish you, shouldn't fight
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you Now you say you're sorry
They're just down the road They've come for me
To take me on
Yet to be matched On the surface simplicity
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
I adapt, contagious
It's in our hands
With the eruption
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
An accurate copy
I just did what I had to do Mamma - ertu vakandi mamma mn?
I don't know my future after this weekend
Told me you were through with me but Now you say you love me
Then the riddle gets solved
Vaik' on kaitaluinen
Now she regrets the whole thing
Your phone is off the hook
I find
You've put a seed inside me,
They saw a big raven
Leitar Lsi var leid, - Lasi from Leiti was on his way
And there is no map and chair too Human behavior, human behavior

Six glasses of water
Simply calling you up
Thinking,
And kick into the start hole And kick into the start hole
Embrace, you tight, let's Unison
Fireworks will burn in
Gling gl, klukkan sl, - Tic toc, the clock chimed
I feel you trickling
When it lands

Way beyond me
I did it
mninn ofar skyum hl, - Moon smiled above the clouds
Aheeeeee
When the bee stings
Wanderlust, peel off the layers
You just did what you had to do
Possibly maybe Since we broke up
(rapture)
I know the future
But brand new Oh
And loved them too Metallic carnage
I'll hide it under a blanket
You remember why it got dark
Since you left my wet embrace and crawled ashore Every boy, is a snake is a lily
How can you offer me love like that?
But I'll defend my child
I adore you
Has her world outside it
One day
Neo-sasar-ohh
Now I'm leaving it all behind I'm going hunting
Why should I run? They'll take your money
Yes, but, you're a girl! I lie in my bed,
I wouldn't mind perhaps
Scrubs horse flies and, and pinches them on a line She has one friend, he lives next door
Teepee style All the still born love that could've happened
It's their turn now Kahi
brtt fr Lnu fr hann svar. - Soon from Lina came his reply
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
My eyes wide open.

Be ready, be ready to get confused and me and my here after
They puzzle me confuse
Thunderstorm come
og loksins l hn dttur, - And finally her daughter was born
I send into you
Now her desires are repressed
Everything just feels so wrong Everything is right
I dive into it
Loves the other
Carnage, rambling What is to do but dig
I just did what I had to do
and that's all
Stampede of sharpshooters
You know I gave it all
How could I be so immature I go humble
Volunteer
But too raw to be embraced
ad elska* Amerkana, - Loving American girls
Trllin thau brdu bumburnar
You're the one who's missing out
We are the earth intruders
I'm holding my breath
Howwwwwwweeeeeeeeeee
Cold froth on my twig
Howweeeeeeeeeeee
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you You drove me, nearly drove me
Crawling in silence
The perfect day
Your charms
Hug suffering
A mendln g
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs I have lost my origin
You All these accidents
Guess, guess what she see, sees there.
Fanta
The city of fear I play dead
It will happen
All birthed and happy
In burning flowers I will take the sun
And glues them together
I said ouch! this really hurts...
Well I've got plenty
To shine just for you I can feel it
This could well be
It guides me on baby
Tha vildi g stjrna bdi hljmsveit og kr Mamma - th ert elskuleg, mamma mn
You should use the pain and sorrow
She is beyond her
I see the islands
Just to make it easier on you
Nuance makes heat
Wanders around desire May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
Coincidence Makes sense
Then they can't handle You can't handle love
(see...)
Is about to happen
Notice
I'm trying to get an angle 'Cause the evening
When I'm feeling bad
And the luminous beam
Keeps spiders in her pocket
I keep calm Possibly maybe probably love
Will I
He's Venus
Sunlight unfolds in my hair Ooooh - I'm walking on air
Of dinosaurs and people
With your charm.
En-cha-le
Rocks growing slow mo (crystalline)
Yet I'm definitive A small story which never happened
Hevosetkin nauraa
Into a small space With clairvoyance
They do a trapeze walk
We are the paratroopers
It loves the other
It surprises and scares
Tide will show you the way
To human, to human, to human, to human Stand up
Say the words to her
Oh, it never really was
Suffocates the soul
How could you do this
And why it is getting light again.
Moon will guide us through
You don't have to explain, I understand You know that I adore you
I'll heal you
About to happen
That never lets you down I can feel it
No-one is awake
You didn't know that I had it in me
Ooh Sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
Halfway to heaven from here
We go to the hidden place
You can't handle I dare you, I dare you
I'm-m-m-mmm...so broken
Undo
Collects fly-wings in a jar
But the darkest pit in me
My Eurasian plate subsumed
Again... This wasn't supposed to happen. I lie in my bed,
As lightning hits my spine
Now aren't we scaring ourselves
I'm coming frawww
There's a naked person in my flat!
Are you hurting your chest,
They make me feel better Now you say you love me
She scratches his beard She's painting huge books
He's Venus as a boy He believes in a beauty
Embraces all
And we're both included It takes courage to enjoy it
their segja vid sig sjlfa, - They say to themselves
I shall tell them I remember you I remember you
And kick into the start hole To risk all is the end all and the beginning all
Air
So you can sleep
Siglir eftir m√©r All the modern things
Human behavior There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
and no-one takes a spin
Hei huulia hillallaa!
I'm in love again... This wasn't supposed to happen!
Pagan poetry I love him, I love him
Would be the hugest crime of them all
You'll meet an army of me You're alright
Muddy with twigs and branches Turmoil, carnage Here come the earth intruders
We shouldn't fight
Unless you breathe in
Fyrst var hann mjg sleginn, - At first he was rather shocked
A soul in sahkahhh
Hann lagdi sinn vana, - He was used to
The light shock I need
My dearest scatter heart
And, like that, it travels along an orbit
You amaze me
Scrape those barnacles
And I don't want to! It takes courage to enjoy it
Pressure I have a recurrent dream
Hide in the air of him
All this flesh on our bones
I nestle into pain
Heart break train,
There's nothing wrong
Once fingers to stroke
Your generosity will show
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
I'd love to read you the way (Just to make it easier on you)
En datt th framr, og thad trufladi mig Th varst drottning hrri hll
I'm in rapture.
You can't handle love
Imagine what my body would sound like
I'll come over
Or you'll join a cult Probably maybe possibly love
I can feel it One day
Off It's in our hands
And stars that fell
Or whatever I find lying around
Brand new tomorrow
Keep it in a hidden place
possibly maybe As much as I definitely enjoy solitude
Of my body I shall enter
They make me feel better We have a recurrent dream
Unnecessarily?
Islenskt grey, - Just a poor Icelander
Let's celebrate now
In our hands
