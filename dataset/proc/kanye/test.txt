She had hair so long that it looked like weave
But my features and my shows ten times your pay
Bam bam eh

Not knowing the disconnect from the father
Cause I definitely be having mineAnd you ain't finna see a, mogul get emotional
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohAt the mall there was a seance
What the hell was I supposed to do
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
I loved you better than your own kin did
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
Yeah my money's so tall that my barbies gotta climb it
You know what I need
Tryna send photos of familia
That's why I'd rather take the 405
Yeah we warriors
(I wish a nigga would)
Far as girls you got a flock
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
As kids we used to laugh
Don't let nobody bring you downYou're so awesome
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your lifeSomething wrong
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
What do I know? Flashing lights, lightsI know it's been a while
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Don't act like I never told ya 
I think big get cash make 'em blink fast
From running through my mind
That use they kids as meal tickets
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I've been so laid out
Somewhere I can feel safe
And I...[Hook: The Weeknd]
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
Trying to stack these millions"
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I just need to know[Bridge]
South side, I'm down to start a riotOoh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Your touch so foreign
It's something that you need to have
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
Treat the demons just like Pam
Might say I hit you
Pray for the parentsI'm tryna keep my faith
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
I can feel it 
I would've been blacked out on your assFour in the morning, and I'm zoning
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
I know, I know, I shouldn't even bother
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole
Runaway from me baby
So I'll just say good night to you
I know you must be tired
(Yeezy thought me)
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
Ahh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
People you never got a chance to say bye to
No more (Los Angeles)
But I'mma have the laugh in the end
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this every day-day? (Huh!)
Dressed in all your fancy clothes.
You'll be my American. American Boy.La da da di da (4x)
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?
Don't act like I never told yaYou know how long I've been on ya?
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
Summer time, no juice
Uh, 21 Grammies superstar family
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Why? I made that bitch famous
And if you did, then that's family businessAnd I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
And then they make noiseCan we get much higher? So high
They see a black man with a white woman
Now she claiming I bruise her esophagus
I'll show you to my bridrens.
Damn, these niggas got me
And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
In the frozen fish aisle feelin' like a whore
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
I bump my head
That's right, that's right!
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
Can we get much higher? So high
I just wanted you to know
And if you knew how proud I was
(I feel it's fadin')I feel it
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
He take his time, he counts it out, I weighs it up, that's real money
Don't know why, but I know a sign when I see it 
Jesus Christ have mercy
Let me run 'til you're off my case
'As I lay me down to sleep
And I dont mean that in no nice wayGot the lil kids singing about the shit now the jokes on you
When i say I've got crabs I mean it literally
I'd take a Salmon home and work that Coddle Fin for hours
Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time (Time)
You'll never find nobody better than meIn the night, I hear 'em talk
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
She get under your skin if you let her
Asking me why the hell I text in code
It's amazing
So far from where we came
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Tell the promoter we need more seats,
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Now I'm on fire, everybody go quiet (sshhh)
We on an ultra light beam
For the road to riches and diamond rings
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
And that haunted me, all the way home
I guess this is my dissertation
Where the eyelids go
I don't let 'em play with me
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now shit!
I gotta live, I gotta love
You can feel the lyrics and spirit coming in braille
We going all the way this time (Time)
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Let me run to see who came undone
Take me to your hood.
Who killin em in the UK, everybody gonna say "You, K!"
Well let this take away from my spins
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Hold up, hold up
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
This is my part, nobody else speak
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like a corner store
And even though I always fuck my life up
And I'm ready to go
Hallelujah
You're so after dark
We don't want no devils in the house
I made that bitch famous
Fuck in the party, pull up her skirt, then skrr
We've become public enemies
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Blazin
But everybody know you brought real rap back
My reign is as far as your eyes can seeIt's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
So I-I am headed home 
I fantasized about this back in Chicago
She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya money

A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis

Tell 'em, "Give me fifty million now or I'mma quit"
Yeah now I'm where i belong girlBut I gotta settle down I can't be a whore

Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Want you to see all of the lightsFast cars, shooting stars
But you never thought that I would take it this far
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

You borrow our motto
Ready for abductionBoy, you're an alien
Run away fast as you can 
I'm in that two seat Lambo' with your girl, she tryna jerk meDrop it to the floor, make that ass shake
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her

I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
You could be the King but watch the Queen conquer
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
Courts suck me dry

Dream beautiful and unusual
