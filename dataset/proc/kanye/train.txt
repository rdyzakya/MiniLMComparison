Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
For my theme song
Nowhere seems to be too far[Hook: Kanye West]
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
Runaway as fast as you can
He was just gon' say whatever you gon' told him too

Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
Yeah, I'm talking bossy, I ain't talking Kelis
I love her, I want her
I got a dirty mind
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
Could be mine would you be my love my love, could be mine
My whole life in the hands of God
I heard the beat the same raps that give the track pain
She's so precious with the peer pressure
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
Early morning cartoon shit
(Jesus Walks with me)To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
Then I hope this take away from my sins
Baby, not for nothing I know
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
(Yeah, now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fish
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, IPerfect[Part 2]Up in the morning, miss you bad
Your bitch got an ass, but my broad way thicker
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
Though I still got the 100 with the small face, nigga
But she ain't messing wit no broke niggas
I still spit it like it's r&b;, come to the club wit me
Fuckin' up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Oh, how could you be so heartless?Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk

Why does she be so mad at me for
I'm bill droppin', Ms. Pacman, this pill popping-ass, ho!
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
Cause baby I'm awesome
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Man that would be so Kanye, that's all it was Kanye
They don't know 'bout me and you
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
They don't understand youYou're from a whole other world
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I was in there like ooh shit I never been here before
But I still drove 30 hours
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
You might think you've peeped the scene
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson & Junie Morrison]
His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
I'm telling you oh, it all falls downI say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
Infect me with your loving
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
A little woozy but a nice night
Like I don't know nobody
Who's provoking you?
Every time I hear bout other, nigga's is stroking you
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish lineSo keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Crazy, just crazy
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
I'm living' in that 21st century
My [?] hand over [?]
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
(You're the only power)
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah

Never gave up
Wood floors in the new apartment
She say she only here for her girl birthday
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
This is everything
I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes
And all our eyes green it only means one thing
Love! I don't get enough of it
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
I g-go for mine, I got to shine
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
And if they hate then let 'em hate
I feel it
New Gospel homey - take 6. And take this, hatersN-now th-that that don't kill me
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards upGossip gossip
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Let the sun come out and all the children sayI woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said, "tru"
(Oh oh you mad, huh?)Oh oh, she gon' be mad right? Ain't that too bad, right?
Crazy
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Money turn your kin into an enemy
This is way too much, I need a momentNo one man should have all that power
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Everybody gon' say something
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
Even though everyone said that I had to make a switch
And wave your body, body, you can get the fuck off this campus
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'
So I got something new to see
I guess the money should've changed them
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hanging off the Eiffel
Head up high, I look to the light
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
(Jesus Walks)

South, south, south side! All day, niggaThis Ye, nigga

Of our imagination, MTV cribs Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
Shout-out to Jackie Chan, I need to stunt right now
I know I was foul bay-bay
Damn, they don't make em like this anymore
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
Want you to see all of the lightsGetting mine, baby
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
You never use to talk dirty, but now you you goddamn disgusting

Roll my weed on it, that's an ass'tray
Roll up, roll up
Hey, I'm goodWelcome to the good life
I'm liking this American Boy. American Boy.[Chorus:]
You choose, you choose
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, uh!

Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"
Lil Boosie with the white now
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
And still will be in love wit meShe said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I'm drunk and high at the same time, drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I said, "Shit I'm chilling
Screaming no no no, no no
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
How many?

Rain pourin' (pourin'), all my cars is foreign (foreign)
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast
(21st century schizoid man)The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
Man I can understand how it might be
Everybody know (I'm a motherfucking monster)
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Chi nigga but these hos love my accent
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
South, south, south side, all day niggaWell, well, well
Standing at my podium
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Do the rap and the track triple double no assist
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
Walking, living, breathing, girl you know my past well
Single black female addicted to retail and wellOh when it all, it all falls down
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
Shut down the whole party
To real friends, to the real end
Pray for the parents(Yes darling...Hallelujah)
Sometimes I'm wishing that my dick had, go pro
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound, believe believe!Well, it is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth in the dance hall
Invites to all my niggas, impregnate Bridget
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti, whip look how I try this shit
How you feeling right now, let me see you ladies in the air
Huh?Real friends
I am a GodAin't no way I'm giving up on my god 
F*ck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion
Rubbing my name threw the mud
You know just what we want
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job[Hook]
The drama, people suing me
This is family business
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt!
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
And still be addicted to them hood rats
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
You're so out the park
We was down in Tribeca
Make me get spiritual
Good morning
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university (All of the lights)Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
Work the middle 'til it hurt a little
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bedRain, rain, rain go away
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
So I think it's time for us to have a toastLet's have a toast for the douche bags
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
You was the best of all time at the time though
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
Why you frontin' on meCause I'd rather do nothing with you

Of weak content and slow jammin'
And I heard the whole thingI heard the whole thing

Get arrested, guess until he get the message
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I pullin up stuff in the Phantom ship
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind? (My mind, my mind, my mind)
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
On an ultra light beam

Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
(It's alright girl) makin' love to other gay fishAll those lonely nights at the grocery store
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
That white frost on that pound cake so your Duncan Hines is irrelevant

Maybe you, do you remember when?
Beautiful morning, give me some in morning baby

Good morningGood morning
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
What I had to do, had to run from you
Better run
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
Just to ask you a question
Word in the streets is they ain't heard from him
How did you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Letting everything goNow this would be a beautiful death
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)
God I'm willing
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
What if we fuck right now?

PETA's mad cause I made a jacket outta possum
When time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
You probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound, believe believe!
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
That major that she majored in don't make no money
Told her she take me back

So I could play that shit back in, slo-mo
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Every move is magicYou're from a whole other world
Your love is fadin'[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
You can't be still
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
I was bred to get in
Mi need dem
If somebody would've told me a year ago
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
Taking all the stacks, oh
While getting' some brain
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
Swizz told me let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me best
And you can't make it right
To make this my mission
I must got a angel
I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
I need you to hurry up now
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Order, huh
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
And this is for the family that can't be with us
So I roll through good

They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"
I'm telling you oh, it all falls downMan I promise, she's so self conscious
Where the eyelids go[Verse 1]
No more (Los Angeles)[Outro: Junie Morrison]
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Letting everything goYou got the power to let power go?
Stop everything you're doing now
We want prenup!, yeah
But I'm looking for the one
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
That'll never
That'll never take work off
Cause baby you're awesome
Now that you're gone it hit us
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
From the streets of the league
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)Now this would be a beautiful death
We going all the way this time
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
I mean I fuck with your friends but damn Gina
And you know it, and you know itSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
Claiming I'm overreacting
If I part my heart will live through you
Nothing unwanted
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitchFour in the morning, and I'm zoning
HallelujahI'm tryna keep my faith
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
No goodbyeI don't wanna say goodbye to you
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
Always turn [?][Outro]
You know that a nigga was lost
Grandma, get 'em shook up
I feel it's fadin'
They say that they don't see what you see in me
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
Was made up centuries ago
And together we are gay fish (gay fish)(Gay fish yo) motherfuckin' gay fish
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us
They want the, they want theI tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
What do I know? Flashing lights, lightsAs you recall, you know I love to show off
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
Lead me into the lightKiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
The best living or dead hands down huh?

And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's
Old niggas mentally still in high school

He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datson
If you ain't with us, you in our way, nigga
From the very start
I'm trying watch my sodium
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Only way I can sum it up, son of a bitch(Hands up, hands up)

If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's bests
I'm tryna keep my faith
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
Like where was you last week? My nigga the fuck was you hidin'?

In a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
So we gonna do everything that Kan like

For everyone who feels they said they've said sorry too many times
(And the fires did declare us)
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
I threw suicides on the tour bus
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink

And next time when I look in your eyes

Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him 
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there
Hotter than a middle eastern climate
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
It take too much to touch her
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I got a hope, I got a chance
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
I'm a maven
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
Even if the money low, can't play meAyy, y'all heard about the good news?

On the hottest rap label around?
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
You know 2 Chainz? Scrr!
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til they drifted Pangaea
Can only make me stronger
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
Excuse me, is you saying something?
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
To 3 A.M., callin'
I need you right now, I need you right now
About this Americana Rama, am I shallow
We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves(Jesus Walks)
(We did)
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
I'm just gonna say good nightI'm not sure anymore-more
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouthBound to fall in love
No I already graduated
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Hurry up with my damn massage
All day, niggaHow long you niggas ball? All day, nigga
I'm not sure anymore-more
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
Baby, we livin' in the moment
And no I ain't been to MIA
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
And I know they love it.
It was more like spoken word
Niggas lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
Pacing, thinking, to myself
Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin'
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit itOh when it all, it all falls down
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Run away fast as you canShe find pictures in my email
She has no idea what she's doing in college
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)I'm a monster
And I be sipping Hennessy, play some R&B;
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
Cause look how death missed his ass
It's time to get the paperI've been outta my mind a long time
And have a reason to cover my face
Revealing the layers to my soul[Hook: The Weeknd]
Where the eyelids go 
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
Momma pass in Hollywood
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Just touched down in London town.
(Jesus walks for them)
I'm in that two seat Lambo' with your girl, she tryna jerk me (Swerve)
Met her at a beauty salon
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
Name one genius that ain't crazy
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho!
Bet they give me a pound.
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
Tell me how do you respawn the students?
Huh?
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Her mother, brother, Grandmother hate me in that order
I'mma disrobe you, than I'mma probe you
Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method
That digs on meNow I ain't saying she a gold digger
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Your love is fadin'
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Tell everybody I'm back in town
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
Before he speak his suit bespoke.
This is how you gone do me, you know, yous a nigga
Don't like his baggy jeans but I'm a like what's underneath it.
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
You've been right in my face
Yeah, you wasn't mine though[Hook]
All for a chance to be a star
And the weather so breezy
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
I keep it 300 like the Romans
Wanna be a victim
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
Every one of them that I know
Why would you ever listen to
Bow on our arrival, the Un-American idols
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
Just shot a shot an amateur video I think I should, go pro
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass'state
I just showed up for the yams though
Put one up in the sky
I-I-I-I did it
See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes
Hurry up with my damn croissants
That ain't right girl
But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
If OJ and every Jordan need a Robin
This is my life homie, you decide yours
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
I done wore designers I won't wear again
(And niggas still hatin') So much hate I need an AK
Then the sky filled with heroines
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
I'm like a fly Malcolm X
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Cop a Prada spacesuit about the stars
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
(Yeah now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fishI really get around I'm the slut of the sea
I be paranoid every time
Stay low, alright
Twista had this shit on in The Source
Eighteen years, eighteen years
From a very far away place
She spent her whole check on some Christians
Yes darling
We 'bout to get this paperI can't let these people play me
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, oh you good?"
And there's no way to slow (down)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Now they wanna hit me with the woo-wap the bam
Like the Pips with the Gladys.
Even for my...Real friends
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Drops some stacks pops is good
Now look at what you just saw I think this is what you live for
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
Even though I'm a man of God
[Intro: Father's Children]
You feel too good to ever hurt
Bam bam dilla, bam bamI just wanted you to know
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get ass a lot[Katy Perry]
I've been so damn gone
Specially on my Pastel, on my Bape shit
We never gonna dieI just wanted you to knowBam bam, bam bam
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye 
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I've be saying how I feel at the wrong time
Reluctantly, 'cause most of this press don't f**k with me.Estelle once said to me, cool down down, don't act a fool now now,
Fire up, tweaking
Stun me with your lasers
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire 
Cause you will never get on top off this
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
Yeah Estelle we about to get down
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
And when you cry, I will cry
Let me see you act up in this mother fucker
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogantYeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Just to see how you was feelin'
They want the, they want theYeah, I'm talking 'Ye, yeah, I'm talking Rih'
