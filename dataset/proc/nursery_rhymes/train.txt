      You silly kittens,
    What shall he eat?  White bread and butter.
      To make a horse-shoe,
    But the rat would not.
    "Little maid, pretty maid, whither goest thou?"
    Spoiling things you do not care.
    My wee, wee ain.
    Jacky shall have a new master.
    Oh! brother Richard, the sun's very high!
MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, AND JOHN
    "I've been all the day
      He'll do well for a grunt,
    Then to either you're welcome, with all my heart.
      Which made poor Simon stare.
    Here comes a thief to pull down your walls.
    He ate the priest, and all the people!
      And nothing could they find,
    I saw three ships come sailing by,
    But now you come at noon.
    One said it was the moon,
      The rest they ran away.

    But the fox was too cunning, and gave him the slip,
      Nor yet very big;
    She lies in bed till eight or nine,
      A knock in the eye.
    And don't know what to do.
    And all the water he had got
    And then one night, when it was dark,
    Then Simple Simon went a-hunting,
    "Twice two, twice seven,
    The Rat, the Mouse, and the little Frog-gee!
      Which made the people laugh.
    Mother Goose had a house,
LADY-BIRD, LADY-BIRD
      Lumpety, lumpety, lump!
    Or a pig without e'er a tail,
    You shall get a coatie when the boat comes in!
      To fetch her down,
    The lion beat the unicorn all round about the town.
IF WISHES WERE HORSES
    They gave a loud knock, and they gave a loud call.
    She sent him to market,
    To powder my locks
      Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r!"
    But the child that is born on the Sabbath day
JACK JINGLE
    Wednesday's child is full of woe,
    They all went together to seek a bird's nest.
    "You're kindly welcome, sir," she said.
SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE
    And now my story's done.
    And the two little kittens had nowhere to go;
    Old King Cole was a merry old soul,
    This is the rat,
    The sails were made of silk,
    Who was not very young, nor yet very old,
    Poor Pussy's weeping, she'll have no more milk,
      Of little Jack Jingle?
      I wonder why they could do so!
    If wishes were horses, beggars would ride;
    I love you well, my little brother,
    And mounting its back,
    When he ran fast, he ran apace.
    Jerry was hung, James was drowned,
      Johnny Winkle he,
    Ride away, ride away, Johnny shall ride
    The king and queen did eat thereof,
    As three blind mice?
    Now Tom with his pipe made such a noise
    But the ox would not.
WHAT ARE LITTLE BOYS MADE OF?
      The same will come, you'll find:
    For I love to please you still."
THREE BRETHREN OUT OF SPAIN
    "Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,
    There was a crow sat on a stone,
    The maids in the meadows are making of hay;
    But the rope would not.
      And I took two pence home to my wife.
    But the stick would not.
      We greatly fear
THE KILKENNY CATS
    What should we do for bread and cheese?
    Little Tommy Stout.
    "But let it be something that's not very long."
    He took a whim, and fairly died;
    "Oh, no!" said the sparrow, "I won't make a stew."
    Polly, put the kettle on,
    Scatters daisies at our feet.
        And so will pigs and swine;
      As I have been told,
    "Old woman, old woman, old woman," quoth I,
    August brings the sheaves of corn,
      And that stands all awry.
    "Put them in the salting-tub,

    But I'll have some of your very best flour,
    "Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog," Mousey said,
    Bobby Shaft is fat and fair,

CHRISTMAS
    Snips and snails, and puppy-dogs' tails;
      The dog said, "Bow-wow!"
    Toss the ball high,

      Feathers bright and yellow;

    Then up she took her little crook,
    Little Tom Tinker's dog,
      Sat upon a hill,
    You shall learn to play with me,
    A pie sat on a pear-tree,
    A swarm of bees in June
      And said it was well.
    Then whipped them all round, and sent them to bed.
    A Long-Tailed pig and a short-tailed pig,
      The hare she loves the hill;
      And ran through the town, the town, e-ho!

    A frog he would a-wooing go,
    Three children sliding on the ice

    But the dog would not.

    They went to sea in a bowl;

    I met a man with seven wives;
    Until her best petticoat's mended with silk!
    He sang Cock Robin's love
    But the moon a-gliding,
    What makes you come so soon?
      And the little boy ran away.
    In other men's ditches.
    And there his nag did kick and prank; he, haw, hum!
    Six little mice sat down to spin,
    I'll sing you a song,
    "What work can she do,
    "Of my spurs take you no thought,

    Hector Protector was sent to the Queen.

THE DAYS OF THE MONTH
    He put her in a pumpkin shell,
      And covered it with rashes.
    Silver and gold will be stole away,
    And swore he would catch the fox in a trap;
    She loved coffee and I loved tea,
    I took him by the left leg,
    We are all in the dumps,
      No lark so blithe as he;
    Little girl, little girl, where have you been?

      The birds began to sing;
    Down came a blackbird,
      Keep a face clean and bright,
      And snapped off her nose.
      "Pussy, are you there?

    When it did bleed, then blood did come.

    I met with a Westminster scholar;
    And I'll give you a slice of bacon;
    Take a cup, and drink it up,

She went a little farther and she met an ox.

      Which much delighted Mary;
    They all went over a bridge together;
    Down where the woodbines creep;
      And when I bake,
    For a pair of new gloves on Easter Day.
    A kind, and sweet, and gentle child--

    For many a joyful day
      And 't was thought what they eat
    When he was gone, then there was none.
    Stole a pig and away he run!
      How does your garden grow?
    I'll bear the torch."
    When he got to the top of the hill,
JACK AND JILL
    Nothing in it,
    If all the world were apple-pie,
    Has twenty nails upon each hand
      "Shall I, oh, shall I?"
A AND B AND SEE
    As fast as he could caper,
    And they that wash on Saturday, oh! they're sluts indeed.
NEEDLES AND PINS
      And your wings of the silver so gray.
    The rat began to gnaw the rope;
    My plate's empty.
    Lay them straight;
    What shall little Betty do?
      All on a summer's day;
      A-sailing on the sea;
      'T was built in a wood,
    |joined          |              |kept          |              |
    'I'  said the kite
      And took them clean away.
      To sing a roundelay.
    Come, who will buy them of me?
      And nodded with her head,
    They began to quarrel and they began to fight;
    In the dark blue sky you keep,
LITTLE JENNY WREN
    While the old woman finished sweeping the floor.
    Rapping at the window, crying through the lock:
    A carrion crow sat on an oak,
    Over the water, and over the lea,
    Dame Trot and her cat
    I do not like thee, Doctor Fell;
    Sam and Betsy on the green?"
    He would if he could,
DIDDLE DIDDLE DUMPLING
THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY
    A man stretched his mouth to its utmost extent,
JOHNNY
    Were four-and-twenty white mice,
    For want of the rider, the battle was lost,
    Ox won't drink water;
    A was an Archer, and shot at a Frog
    With hands ever ready
    She stole oranges, I do believe.
MARY, MARY
    And here's a leg for a stocking,
    Such joy there was at my wedding,
    "Here, Mother," says he,
    "Hiss!" quoth the iron;
    Little miss, pretty miss,
    With vinegar and brown paper.
      Nor yet very bad.
    I'll sing his dirge."
    'I'  said the sparrow
    The rose is red, the violet blue,
    With twenty thousand men;
    "Pray, Mistress Mouse, are you within?"
      The cradle will rock;
As she was coming home she came to a stile; but Piggy would not go
    This is the priest all shaven and shorn,
      To buy him some hose;
      For still they were all fleeting.
    "My face is my fortune, sir," she said.
    "I'll sing you a song that I have just made."
    Seventeen, eighteen,
    Every sack had seven cats,
THERE WAS A MAN
    Two little kittens one stormy night,
    Fills the children's hands with posies.
    Nor I'll have none of your barley;
    And he said: "Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?
ONE MISTY MOISTY MORNING
      But the wild duck flew away;
    A golden bird.
    And what do you think it was about?
      And a pair of breekies,
      And sat down beside her,
    Five angels there lie spread;
    And makes him bring back one leg.
    And thus when once, my little dears,
    And he chirruped, he chirruped, so merry was he;
    Warm September brings the fruit;
MERRY ARE THE BELLS
    He went for water in a sieve,
    If there be one, seek till you find it;
    He saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,
    He learned to play when he was young,
      And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;
    "Thank you, kind sir, I hear you very clearly."
    |it.             |              |              |              |
    And if it's well sung,
    He had young ones both nine and ten;
    Who never did him any harm,
      Mother, mother."
GOOD-FRIDAY SONG
      "I'll try, I'll try, I'll try."
      To buy him a wig;
    I had a little moppet,
    Jack ran to his mother,
        And curl my hair.
      Mother, mother.
      And the masts were made of gold.
    Quack, quack, says the duck;
    Took ill on Thursday,
    This is the end
    Hark, hark! the dogs do bark,
    I'll be the parson."
    The little boys of London Town,
    Up hill and down dale;
    I spent a penny of it, I spent a penny of it,
        My love will come in,
    They ate their meat without fork or knife,
      And lay down on some hay;
    He went to try if cherries ripe
    The man in the moon
    |nodded          |              |opened        |              |
    Went round about the house to find
      And wealthy and wise.
    He bit his tongue until he cried,
    The miller did swear
    Our cottage vale is deep;
    Cocks crow in the morn
    As full of apples as may be;
THE CUCKOO
    I'd fain have made a fortune but did not know how;
    A cat with her kittens came tumbling in.
    And beat the Knave full sore.
    He sings all day.
    The one named Jack,
      And called it sugar-candy.
    And gave the Prince of Orange her.
    "Water, water, quench fire!
    She threw him down upon the ground,
      My fiddle and I have had.
        There was a little man,
    Of an old nanny goat,
    A halfpenny loaf will serve us all;
    And swept the two kittens right out of the room.
    Such a sweet pet as this
    Here's a nail, and there's a prod,
    And Johnny's a drummer, and drums for the king.
    The tailor he shot and missed his mark,
HEY! DIDDLE, DIDDLE
    Goosey, goosey, gander,
    I had a little nut-tree, nothing would it bear
      On a very fine gander.
      That would not say his prayers;
    Then the leaves are whirling fast.
    He blew his trumpet both loud and shrill,
    "May I go with thee?" "Aye, by-and-by."
MY LADY WIND
    "You'll have that mouse? we'll see about that!"
    Lost her holiday shoe,
    Curl your locks as I do mine;
A STRANGE SIGHT
    There was a chandler making candle,
    From it she raised up such a flame,
      Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!
    Upon St. Paul's steeple stands a tree,
    Whether his mother would let him or no.
GOING TO ST. IVES
      Threw the hot iron, smack!
    Two old women got up in an apple-tree;
    There was a butcher cut his thumb,
    Come with a whoop, and come with a call,
    And the days turn lang,
      Was in his mother's pail.
    I love nothing, a jolly, jolly nothing,
    I'll crawl to a garden and jump through the pales,
      I took a penny home to my wife.
    I'm going to the meadow to see them a-mowing,
    "Speak a little louder, sir, I'm very thick of hearing."
    Windows made of black pudding and white,
    "Down in the forest to milk my cow."
    When the pie was opened
    February brings the rain,
    On Saturday night
    The cat's in the cupboard
      And ne'er went up again.
      And then I bade him drum.
    It happened one day as Bo-Peep did stray
      For white wine and red;
    Says the little girl to the little boy,
    A diller, a dollar,
    The fox jumped up on a moonlight night;
    That's what little boys are made of, made of.
        So will you ay or nay
      "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee."
      The news for to tell,
      And thought he could not fail,
    Jack found one morning,
    Each thought there was one cat too many;
QUEEN ANNE
    There was a piper had a cow,
      But could not find one there.
      Into sweet Columbine.
    She waggled with her tail,
      Because he will not stay."
      Fol de riddle, lol de riddle, hi ding do.
LITTLE BOY BLUE
    And you shall have some pie.
    They never ate mustard in all their whole life;
    And take the fairest in your sight."
    On our meat and on us all!
      And so do we.
    Two legs sat upon three legs,
    "Are the children in their beds, for it's past eight o'clock."
    The cow jumped over the moon;
    Blow, wind, blow! and go, mill, go!
      Which made poor Simon whistle.
      So she said:
ROCK-A-BY, BABY
    What are little boys made of?
      Of busy lady Wind!
    And what they could not eat that night,
    Little Nanny Etticoat,
WASH ME AND COMB ME
    "I'm going a-milking, sir," she said.
    My master's lost his fiddle-stick,
    Fiddle-de-dee, fiddle-de-dee,
    I'll dig his grave."
      And killed a crow.
    I saw a ship a-sailing,
    To frighten the terrible Thomas A'Tattamus!
    Your house is on fire, your children have gone,
      "I thought so," says Jack.
    I had money and he had none,
    And then I shall have a good dinner like you."
    Five, six,
        Fly away, Jack!
    "Buy me a milking-pail,
    I never would cry old chairs to mend.
    The maid was in the garden
    "Hoogh, hoogh, hoogh!" quoth he,
      He put in his thumb,
    No doors there are to this stronghold,
      Before the ice would bear;
    The man in brown soon brought him down,
      No bigger than my thumb;
    Says Jack, "the shoe's spoiled,
      We very much fear
LITTLE MISS MUFFET
    Buttons, a farthing a pair,
    "I'll say Amen in the dark;
    Nay, I'll not give my fiddle
    She went to the barber's
    He let off his gun, but he fired too soon,
      For spoiling her nice new clothes.
    What are little girls made of?
      As well as another body?
TEN FINGERS
    Home again, home again,
    I told you before 't was a stormy night
    And vowed he would serve them the same the next day,
    When he had done what man could do,
    Combing down his yellow hair;
    'I'  said the owl
    Father's gone a-hunting,
A MEDLEY
    Or the little god of Love turn the spit, spit, spit?"
    Jack Sprat had a pig, who was not very little,
    I spent nothing of it, I spent nothing of it,
    The fly shall marry the humble-bee;
    Where's the peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked?
sixpence.
    And now my story's begun:
    "Ho, ho!" quoth the frog, "is that what you mean?
    It's for her gold she must be sold;
SIMPLE SIMON
      Within a hollow tree;
    And do you ken Nancy Dawson, honey?
      Threescore miles and ten.
    As I was going to sell my eggs,
      Out of the baker's shop,
    All this is true, without deceit.
    No, you shall have no pie.
    Until they come to London Bridge.
    Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree;
    Lost her pocket,
    I'll have none of your nasty beef,
      Because he had no soap:
      Hush! hush! mee-ow, mee-ow."
    To fetch a pail of water.
    And if that Nancy Cook
    The Dove says, coo, coo, what shall I do?
    In a white petticoat

    For all the lady's hire.
    He knew a mouse was not a rat.
    Georgy Porgy ran away.
      Honey, quoth she;
    The water began to quench the fire;
    What a naughty boy was that,
    The tide soon got the mastery,
    An owl came out and flew about,
      Was built upon a bough;
    How many strawberries grew in the sea?
    Daddie's comin' hame;
    As I was going o'er Westminster Bridge,
    Some to the wheel and some to the rock,
    There was an owl lived in an oak,
    In the wainscot peeping sly,
      And Johnny shall go to the fair,
     And carries his nose in a plaster.
    A Farmer went trotting upon his gray mare,
    "What is your father, my pretty maid?"
      And vowed he'd steal no more.
TO THE HAYFIELD
    The King of Spain's daughter came to see me,
      Ye'll  never thrive again!
    In comes the little dog,
    Rat won't gnaw rope;
      Jiggety jig.
    "Dog, dog, bite pig!
SULKY SUE
    A good fat hen;
      "Put on your mittens,
    Rub-a-dub-dub,
      I will go with you, if that I may.
    "Betsy's gone a-milking,
      "I have not got any."
    He called for his pipe,
    Take my advice, restrain the tongue,
    "Yes, my Polly, so I will,
    There was an old woman called Nothing-at-all,
    And now, good sir, your horse is shod."
    Of Solomon Grundy.
THE OWL IN THE OAK
    I love fourpence, a jolly, jolly fourpence,
      "If Pompey won't talk, why, I must."
    Stick one down,
      Fell sighing and sobbing
    She cut off their tails with a carving knife;
    |                |longed        |              |mourned       |
      For they'd left all their tails behind them.
    And all the little ones said:
    As the light-hearted fairy, heigh ho, heigh ho?
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY
    "We are three brethren out of Spain,
    As the light-footed fairy, heigh ho, heigh ho?
    Higgledy, piggledy, niggledy, niggledy,
      Then he began again.
    This plaguy old woman could never keep quiet.
    For every evil under the sun,
      They'll think that I'm gone mad;
    He pricked his finger very much,
THREE JOLLY WELSHMEN
    A naughty boy came with his wee bow and arrow,
    With the skinny side out, and the woolly side in,
      'Tis time you learned to fly;"
    For in this land they were not bought.
      That the miller may grind his corn;
    Robert Barnes, fellow fine,
    So Hector Protector was sent back again.
    Till she comes to.
    Sat down for to chat;
    Thou shalt not wash dishes, nor yet feed the swine;
    Heigh O, heigh O, heigh O!

    To try to drown poor pussy cat,
    Every lady in this land
    "Croak," said the toad, "I'm hungry I think,
A DILLER, A DOLLAR.
    Master I have, and I am his man,
    Look before you venture out,
    Multiplication is vexation,
    Who'll be the clerk?
      Here we go down, down, down;
    I had a little pony
    For Jacky and me.
        And so will I have mine.
    "What age may she be?
    The bridge was broken and they all fell in,
      And bring their tails behind them.
    He ate a butcher and a half;
    But oh, she's too young
      It shall yet make a hiss."
      Went up the hill,
    Thrice so merrily hopped she,
    Go to bed third,
    And I will sing a pretty song."
    As fast as I can.
    Except in leap-year, when's the time
    The King of France came down the hill,
    Look to thyself,
    Put them in the salting-tub,
    "You sha'n't have the mouse," said the little one.
    The Robin and the Wren
    To see what my black hen doth lay.
      Division is as bad;
      Dance o'er my Lady Lee;
    You used to come at ten o'clock,
    For you never shut your eye
    I'll build thee a silver stye,
    If you did not twinkle so?
    And over the water to Charley,
    Every wife had seven sacks,
    Even pigs on their hind-legs would after him prance.
    Some in jags, and some in rags,

    THE MAN IN THE WILDERNESS
COCK-CROW
      For, to people's surprise,
    When he'll come home he'll marry me,
    Then he plunged in above his knees,
    He always walked upon his feet,
      And here's a foot for a shoe,
    S was a Sailor, and spent all he got
    And never fasted when he eat.
      As brothers ought to be.
    I see no reason
    Found it;
    That married the man all tattered and torn,
WHAT CARE I?
    They did not awake till the clock struck ten;
    I have seen you, little mouse,
    And a very fine fiddle had he;
    Oh, who is so merry, so merry, heigh ho!
    Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,
    Bless the bed that I lie on!
    And hung them up to dry;
      The cat has bit it quite in two.

TOAD AND FROG

WEE WILLIE WINKIE
    Birds of a feather flock together,
    Then Jack went a-courting
    The king he had a daughter fair,
    She rode him through the mire;
    Who'll toll the bell?
    And in it put great lumps of fat,
    X was Expensive, and so became Poor
      The half of his due.
      As sweet as the May.
      And began for to rail;
    When one said to the other dog,
    Helped, with drinking, to keep them alive.
    Who caught his blood?
    The stick began to beat the dog;
      The north wind doth blow,
    The butcher, the baker,
    "Where are you going to, my pretty maid?"
    And said to myself,
      An egg of pure gold.
      Mi-ow, mi-ow, mi-ow!
GOOD KING ARTHUR
    And in her best petticoat burnt a great hole.
      And had got away through the town, e-ho!
    Which finger did he bite?
    And there will be enough
      Up to his little chin.
    This is the malt
    The baker came out and gave him a clout,
    Then 'tis at the very best.
    A Pie sat on a pear-tree,
    Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town,

THE LITTLE MAN WITH A GUN
    The cock's on the housetop, blowing his horn;
      To buy him some bread,
    Lived under a hill,
    The merchants of London they wear scarlet;
    He's my love for evermore!
      That had got a little calf,
    Once I caught a fish alive,
    With King Cole
    The cock sparrow flew over the table,
      The girl in the lane, that couldn't speak plain,
    Down tumbled wheelbarrow, little wife, and all.
    The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,
She went a little farther and she met some water.
    The mischievous raven flew laughing away,
    Come to your playfellows in the street.
    How does Cousin Sue do?

    I answered him, as I thought good,
    Simon Brodie had a cow;

HOW DO YOU DO?
    A penny white loaf,
    Over the water, and over the sea,
    Round it.
    Which is the way to London town?
    And while he ran, as I am told,
      You shall get a fishie
    In looking over London Bridge,
      Going to the fair;
    And they all lived together in a little crooked house.
    My lady Wind, my lady Wind,
    They're round and sound and pretty,
    And all the birds in the air couldn't catch me.
UP HILL AND DOWN DALE
    A whisper reaches itching ears,
    Tell-tale-tit,
    She went to the baker's
    For they found it was better, that stormy night,
    And if the bowl had been stronger,
      Put on the pan, says Greedy Nan,
    He went to the garden
    But when he saw his eyes were out,
    The cat she seized the rat by the crown,
    "What are you at, my little men?"
    "If it be in the night,
    Dance, little Baby, and Mother will sing,
    She had a son Jack,
    The lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown;
    Jack Jingle went 'prentice
    And they scratched and they bit,
    The dame said, "Your servant,"
    One a penny, two a penny,
    And all the pretty maids are plain to be seen;

    Though I know not what you are,
    Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;
    Cock Robin got up early,
      Dance to your daddie,
    How many miles is it to Babylon?
      And nodded with her head.
    Dingty, diddledy, my mammy's maid,
      What should we do for drink?
      And shot it right through the head, head, head.
    Merry is your sing-song, happy, gay, and free,
    Or not look to thyself,
    And all the little young ones said:
    The little dog laughed
    And you and I will keep ourselves warm.
      But, chancing to miss,
      The sea was thrown then,--
      He was riding a goat.
    The wife who sells the barley, honey?
    But now he's dead, and that's all over.
    A gown of silk and a silver tee,
      Mounted on a pony;
    |                |L             |              |M             |
    Take care of thyself,
      The dog made a bow;
    By the point of his knife,
      To any man alive.
THE GIRL IN THE LANE
      And Practice drives me mad.
    A golden pheasant;
      Without a wig,
    For want of the battle, the kingdom was lost,
    If this account be true,
    When they were wanted to make the new hay.
     And loved by his usher and master;
She went a little farther and she met a butcher.
    And quickly did return
TELL-TALE-TIT
    I answered myself,
SEE, SEE!
    And his fiddlers three!
THE MOUSE RAN UP THE CLOCK
    How will he be married without e'er a wife?
    He met old Dame Trot with a basket of eggs,
LITTLE JACK HORNER
    He found a crooked sixpence beside a crooked stile;
    Pussy sits beside the fire,
      And pulled out a plum,
    Cold and raw the north wind doth blow,
    And if she's not gone, she lives there still.
    So, with sparrows and cuckoos,
    This is the dog,
    This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,
    There was an old woman, and what do you think?
    We'll call again another day."
    Till the pail was broke, and the milk ran on the ground.
    Though ne'er instructed by a cat,
OF ARITHMETIC
    And why may not I love Johnny
    There was a man of Thessaly,
    Diddle diddle dumpling, my son John.
    And their tongues moved whenever they spoke.
A APPLE PIE
    Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen;
    I'll be the clerk."
    Up went Pussy cat and down went he.
    The storms grow stronger
    A horse's head where his tail should be!
    But while they were all a merry-making,
    Pastry and pie-crust were the wall;
    He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
      Came behind his back,
    Bobby Shaft is gone to sea,
    The fire began to burn the stick;
    There was a monkey climbed a tree,
    So Doll and the cow danced "the Cheshire round",
    Then to gather nuts is pleasant.
    The Jew got the goose,
    He never took toll
    "Nobody asked you, sir," she said.
A, B, C
    Skipping by their fleecy dams.
    Had a wife and couldn't keep her;
    Little Polly Flinders
    As it fell out, they all fell in,
    I had a little boy,
ST. VALENTINE'S DAY
A CARRION CROW
      Two happy little boys.
    I went to Taffy's house, Taff was not at home;
    She went to the undertaker's
    She stole oranges, I'm afraid;
    She then with her wand
    He ate the dormouse,
    Here's A, B, and C, D, E, F, and G,
    "Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me?"
    "Over the hills and far away".
    How do you do? how do you do? how do you do again?
    Doctor Foster went to Glo'ster,
    One day the sun was warm and bright,
    If you haven't got a penny, a ha'penny will do,
    There was a little man, and he had a little gun,
    He ne'er stood still for young or old.
      And out he came, hop, hop, hop.
    Daffy-down-dilly has come to town,
    Neighbour, how do you do?
      Gallop a dreary dun;
    When he fell down, then down fell he.
      Upon a summer's day,
THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN
    And all the dogs in our town
    Old clothes to sell, old clothes to sell;
    And knows this is the fount of all learning.
DANTY BABY
    To roast the little duck he had shot in the brook,
      A plain-looking lad,
    As many as red herrings grew in the wood.
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper,
    Of a mouse in his life!

    Pinned with a silver pin,
    When the wind is in the North,
    The dog began to bite the pig;
    Is worth a silver spoon;
    Who pulled her out?
    O was an Oyster Wench, and went about Town
    He ate a church, he ate a steeple,
    "Ah, ha, that is warm!" said Brian O'Lin.
      And we'll have tea.
    I sold my cat and bought me a mouse;
    The butcher began to kill the ox;
NANNY ETTICOAT
    I love sixpence, a jolly, jolly sixpence,
      Went out to take a ride,
    When I was a little boy,
      I'd spend it all upon you.
    And then she'll walk upon two.
    There was a horse going to the mill,
    And bade him play the other tune--
      The martin and the swallow;
    He changes his tune.
    They'd both eat together,
    One foot up, the other foot down,
    "With my bow and arrow,
      All hung on a tree to dry.
    Sit up a while, says Slow;
    But will come and hear you sing,
    How many were there going to St. Ives?
    Who will delve;
CURLY LOCKS
    What can mammy do wid 'e,
    When they heard the bell toll
    Old Mother Hubbard
      The dog sat in a chair.
    And squeak, goes the rat.
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    The cat and the fiddle,
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Some gave them plum-cake, and sent them out of town.
      To set before the king?
    The third he said it was a house,
    Then the traveller in the dark
    Remember what old nurse has sung
    And mark it with T,
      Blowsey boys buble, oh,
      They both walked on their feet,
      For sentinel stood.
    The mouse ran up the clock,
    Then I'll hop away to the next meadow stream,
      The queen next morning fried.
    Dance, little Baby, dance up high,
    Little girl, little girl, what gave she you?
    "Four and twenty, that's enough,"
    Little Tom Tucker sings for his supper.
CROSS-PATCH
    As fair as a lily, as white as a wand.
THE LITTLE GUINEA-PIG
    And he called for his fiddlers three.
    When from a place he ran away,
    "That may be so, but you don't come in."
    Died on Saturday,
    Give the barber a pinch of snuff.
        The self-same thing will be.
    Says Judy to Punch,
    She shall have a spouse,
      "Washed your mittens!
      The other named Jill.
      She wanted to wander,
    I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed,
    And your comb shall be made of the very beaten gold,
    And the kitchen clock I was going to wind
NONSENSE
    And never went there again.
TOM THE PIPER'S SON
      Betty Winkle she
    She won't get up to feed her swine,
    And turned her at once
    Says he, "I'll shoot you, silly bird,
      She says "What for?" and "Why?"
    Those that come after
    And tho' victuals and drink were the chief of her diet,
      Jiggety jog.
ALL FOR WANT OF A NAIL
    Charley loves good ale and wine,
    Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
    One, two,
    Who is sagacious and discerning,
      And learn to use my toys;
    I'd fain have made a fortune but lost the best half;
      Into a dirty slough.
    And pretty maids
      A-sailing with the wind.
      Daddy is near;
      So fiddle, faddle, feedle!"
    "O then, Polly, I'll make haste,
    Sugar and spice, and all things nice,
      Do, do, what shall I do?
    I will shoot you through,
    Lose your supper and lose your sleep,
LENGTHENING DAYS
THE OLD WOMAN TOSSED IN A BASKET
      And loved to be picking a bone, e-ho!
      As big as my two thumbs.
      Sat hearing her canary.
    |A               |              |B             |              |
    Determined to shoot this little Cock Sparrow;
    They run with hooks and pull them down;
    Because he bit my finger so.
SIMON BRODIE'S COW
DAFFY DOWN DILLY
      To say there was none there.
She went a little farther and she met a dog.
    Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef;
    When the wind is in the West,
    With a merry ding-dong, happy, gay, and free,
      He whipped his scholars now and then;
SOLOMON GRUNDY
She went a little farther and she met a stick.
    To stir the dancing daffodil.
    And why may not I love Johnny?
    Simple Simon met a pie-man,
    The ladle stood up like a naked man,
    "Oh, no, I'll not, I'll help you spin."
      And gave the piper a penny,
      And dreamt she heard them bleating;
      You naughty kittens!"
      And you are fond of me;
    She went to the ale-house
    Fifteen, sixteen,
    So they laid them down on the mat at the door,
      and cockle shells,
    Then the old man got up in his red cap,
A FROG HE WOULD AWOOING GO
      The little man made it his mark, mark, mark.
    Then up starts Robin, and looks at the sky;
    Please to remember
      Till it would not do.
    Buy her another
    And all for the want of a horse-shoe nail!
MARY'S CANARY
LUCY LOCKET
DANCE, LITTLE BABY
    Little Tommy Tittlemouse
    Jack's mother came in,
    Bow, wow, wow, whose dog art thou?
LITTLE ROBIN REDBREAST

    "Where will the pigs lie,

      With the chimney blown away.
      The cock sang merrily;
        For nobody cares for thee.
    Once so merrily hopped she,
      And he'd go and fetch the drake, drake, drake.
ROBIN, THE BOBBIN
KING PIPPIN'S HALL
    And knocked it right off his head, head, head.
      And scratched out both his eyes:
    Instead of two cats, there weren't any.
    And soon ate up the pie;
    Barber, barber, shave a pig,
      Her father was a miller;
    There was a little boy went into a field,
    |J               |              |K             |               |
    He worked and sang from morn till night,
    And so the old woman got home that night.
GOOSEY, GOOSEY, GANDER
    When he whipped them he made them dance
