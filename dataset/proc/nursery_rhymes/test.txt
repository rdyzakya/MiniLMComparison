    Fresh October brings the pheasant;
    There were once two cats of Kilkenny,
DOCTOR FAUSTUS
She went a little farther and she met a cat.
    All but one, that lies under a stone;
    Cut them on Monday, you cut them for health;

    John Cook was riding up Shuter's bank; he, haw, hum!

    The cow considered very well,
    What shall we do?
JOHN COOK'S GREY MARE
    Says the little boy to the little girl,
      And brought it in to roast;
      How can she be fair?
    He went to slide upon the ice,
She went a little farther and she met a fire.
So the old woman went to the cow and said: "Cow, cow, will you give me
    He crept up to the chimney pot,
      Baked in a pie.
        And eke ye that have none,
    If there be none, never mind it.
    "Oh, let us have the pie!
    I sold my six horses and I bought me a cow,
      Grew very fond;
    Two little dogs sat by the fire,

I HAD A LITTLE PONY
    If you are to be a gentleman, as I suppose you be,
      And went his way.
      To buy him some fruit;

    She tried the keyhole in the door,

    Away, birds, away!
    John Cook was riding up Shuter's hill; he, haw, hum!
    For diamonds are trumps,
      Should ever be forgot.
    Was not that a dainty dish
    And reaped it with my little pen-knife,
    Doctor Faustus was a good man,
    There were sweetmeats in the cabin,
    There's a neat little clock,

    There was a jolly miller once
    Worse on Friday,
    And wished me a very good morrow.
    If I should give my fiddle
    With ducks and with crows,

    That's what little girls are made of, made of.

    There was a little woman, as I've been told,
    I put my finger in my eye,
    There was a lady loved a swine,
    One, two, three, four, five,
    As I was going to St. Ives
    Merry let us part, and merry meet again;
    Charley, Charley, stole the barley
    I bought a little horse,
    They that wash on Friday, wash in need;
    Let us be kind to one another,
    Up to the ceiling, down to the ground,
    But the butcher would not.
    You'll grease my beard and ride on my back
    And keep them all like gentlemen.

    All the day they hunted,
    Round about the dishes creep,
      And so the poor dog had none.
    My song had been longer.
    The sweetest note he always sung,
    There was a little Guinea-Pig,
    And that's all.
    Did you ever see such a thing in your life
    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
    All of a row;
    When I am king you shall be queen;
    Then up Jack got up, and off did trot,
      Counting out his money;
    The cat's run away with the pudding-bag string.
    Can I get there by candle-light?
    And a merry sing-song, happy let us be!
    I never would cry old chairs to mend;
    Merry was myself, and merry could I sing;

    Sportsmen then begin to shoot.
