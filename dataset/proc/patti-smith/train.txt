Break it up, oh please take me with you.
the sun blooms
the American zone
and said come on eat
Beneath the southern cross
Sea returns to sea
I would measure the success of a night 
When you're walking near the water there
Walkin' down the street
Come come come come back come back
Like a log of Helen, is my pleasure. 
Oh no, I'm always doing something's always happening to me
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
We waltzed beneath God's point of view
On this night of wonder
Leave me something to live.
If we believe in the night we trust
Isabella, all is glowing.
The wall. The wall.
From the splinters of stations 
This is my jack-knife. This is my jack-knife.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
And my sleepin' it was broken
The girls will tear you apart
I will give to you
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
May your path be your own
Take arms. Take aim. Be without shame
And a room in Lebanon
I move in another dimension
Do you like the world around you?
lick of flame
Who will never grow
No savior jailer can take it from me
And oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
and I opened up my veins to them
I'll protect Mama
See when they offer me book of gold,
Holy the unknown buggered and suffering beggars
Well you're a little insane
You were small, an angel, are you gone gone?
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
They sat there they sat there watching the sun
Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge
What about it, what about it, what about it?
I am the spring, the holy ground,
Take vows inside of it.
thy breath thy spear
salute our love
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove
So darling farewell
Are the perfect thing for your system
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Oh baby, I remember when you were born,
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.
Tonight I'm goin' out, oh yeah Baby got it but baby want more
Sweet revenge
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,
It serves man
Hi, hi, I was running after you for a long time
In light rapidly changing
The wall is high, the black barn,
Oh, I hear him callin' down to me.
Lady liberty, lend a hand to me, I've been cast adrift.
When I am troubled in the night
Bread of your bread, ghost of your host,
Pull me close, try and understand
Baby was it in the closet.
And we never got lucky
That something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack,
the arctic sea where shadows
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man
Wave thou are music
the endless seed of mystery,
Come on honey
I never wanted to see the sun again
Come on. Come and love me.
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor
Hear it on the radio, hear it on the radio
Baby get it there, baby tag it,
Come on. Set me free.
tell him to get out of here
I wanted for you
was all that I pursued
And he does not sing a thing mournful
Oh, don't you know that anyone can come
I know that I'll see you up there
Cut the chord. Overboard. Just a refugee.
He stayed behind the assembly hall,
Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome.
What is it, Father, that is waiting in Heaven?
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
but I was free
two steps
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Because the night belongs to lovers
Oh, to be not anyone
Beyond the shelf
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
Lightning as armor and it's today
Don't forget who you are
dancing around
Raise the sky.
Quite as interesting to me
And say, "oh my God here's midnight!"
But it's decreed the people rule
Leave me something.
Speak to me heart
gone to where the feather flies
less than a breath of shimmer and smoke
A way I wish to know
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
The ambassador jewels
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
When my hair was cropped, I craved covering, 
Gone this maze of being skin
In 1959
Can come to pass through our union
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card
yet fell beneath his luck
The tiniest train
I don't want no handout;
the empty vein
No one to bow to, to vow to, to blame.
whirl away
A glow we will all know
Can't you show me nothing but surrender?‚Äù
Without you I cannot live
Oh but it's all spilt milk to me.
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,
Little blue wings as those feet fly
That I'll never end transcend transcend.
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby,
Each dream of life I'll share with you
I want another, baby.
till we can rest
So he cried out as he stretched the sky,
With love we sleep
to the simple
Sometimes my spirit's empty;
Our wild love came from above
I was at the stadium
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Say you dream of me.
[?] if he would just tell me
(up there)
And I know soon that the sky will split
Holy the supernatural, extra brilliant, intelligent, kindness of the soul
up there -- there is a sea
Break it up, break it on up, up, up
He has gone
What about it? What about it?
and they beckoned and they beckoned
Looking for you
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me
he ascends into the wind
Holy my mother in the insane asylum
And my senses newly opened
You're a little insane.
Hoverin' liquid, move over moon for my
I saw and no one seemed to mind
From the deep
Oh I give my life for you.
needed nobody
It was there he made his bed,
and dry them with my hair
Not sentimental
Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me.
And your pants are tight
[?] nobody gets anything
I formed me a presence whose aspect was changing
She is the essence of thee
and move on
But that we were we were waving to each other
Each way I turn
[Everything on the current] moved up
a burning stem
And the people that confronted him were many.
That makes me feel just what I need.
On the one I love.
Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
He rips his leg open, so out of time.
Honey, well, we were lookin' fine
I walked the floor then I looked away
Thy soul to keep
Where the wild goats play
Holy the fifth International, holy the Angel in Moloch
We are bells on the shore
Toward the inn
In the night, in the eye of the forest
ummm what a treat
In 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959
Flung from paradise
Oh, to cry not any cry
Ahh to be your destiny
(the veins)
My head is aching as I drink and breathe
Oh, into the center of my brain, and baby come, baby go
That dreams itself
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore. 
We shut our eyes we stretch out our arms
grateful arms grateful limbs
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Twenty-five stories over Detroit,
Wild card up my sleeve
What about it, you don't need me,
Will be here just here
Gradually lapping into sea horses
and he's gone again
Break it up, break it up, break it on up
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
but none but sky
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
He sang, "Break it up, oh, I don't understand.
One of vanity
Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes
Oh, the way that I see him is the way I see myself.
The typewriter is holy, the poem is holy
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,
Everybody got the feelin'
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
All must not be art. some art we must disintegrate.
Ice, it was shining.
And honey honey the call is for war
will cross again
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun
There's a little place, a place called space
Because tonight there are two lovers ...
Weeping yarn from Algiers. Weeping yarn from Algiers.
You know I see it written 'cross the sky
Building scenes on empty dreams
Took it underground, M.C. borderline, up against the wall.
but yet you, you will cut someone down for their possessions
To be where you are
And all of the gain
A name. A name. A name... 
some born to dancers
With the elements of a voluptuous disease
and himself as well
Jackson Pollock was a nigger.
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.
Take my hand as the sun descends
What is this wisdom, eyes of God,
If we dream, dream, dream for free.
La, la la la la la landing.
the children will rise
And he looked up and the rays shot
also makes fertile
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
You and your alien arms
and make us reel
Wish for your brother.
you eat eat eat
that went streaming through the sands like fingers,
As long as you're safe, Kimberly.
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so.
All my dresses you made by hand
oh-wo-wo ...
thy season of mirth
No longer presidents but prophets
It was like a painting of a vase,
Hey hey
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
You say you pray for me.
Seven screaming horses
From the foam
I could exude over the columns that nestled the P.A. 
[Spoken]
Humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter
all the days of my life.
And whirl on a pane of glass
could do for you
passively stationed
(The royal, the throne, the cry me a river)
You must divide the wheat from the rats
The lights were violet and white. 
Common fortune seeks us all
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
In a room somewhere
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,
Again I am the salt, the bitter laugh.
Holy the lone juggernaut, holy the vast lamb of the middle class
As I speculate the eighth
Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore.
Listen, I believe everythin' we dream
In the glittering stars
and we'll slide down
So you want to be a rock & roll star
And free the hurricane, oh I go into the center of the airplane,
some material thing
the ashes rain
grateful man he's gone again
First take my hand now let it go
didn't have a move
Will cross again
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
like a Valentine
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway
To breathe an air
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
You're a little insane
Inherent with(in) us is the dream of the task of the alchemist to create from the clay of man.
No other thing is luck like that
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,
for we three.
Baby's got somethin', gonna get through, through
And May ribbons streaming
The skin is holy, the nose is holy
To sell plastic wares
In a holy war
And the empty child is free
To redeem the work of fools
I could see the sights
and then we will arise
You're ever on my mind
To wrestle the earth from fools
It starts crumbling in his hands.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
waiting underground
like an ancient claim
And the borders of heaven
Needed you, you withdrew
The palace of answers with me, Marie
Not to hail a barren sky. Sifting cloth is weeping red.
(babble)
five steps
its stream
A saint in any form.
And these viral times
Easter Sunday, we were walking.
In the land of Shangri-La
It was ladened with all kinds of shit
Who walked the curve of the world
When life is new
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
(oh god I fell for you ...)
That our friends can't be with us today.
(Lenny!)
grateful heart he's gone again
Slid in that thing and it grew wings
Oh, can't you see that time is the key that will unlock the destiny
If you believe all your hope is gone
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi
Into your starry eyes, oh.
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
you can hold on the blade and turn around forever
Let's soar
I'll be a soldier
soared over Spain
Are zipped up tight tonight
To take His hand, His sacred heart
Holy the clocks in space, holy the fourth dimension
Up, up to the belly of a ship.
captivate my dreams
Speak to me shadow
Each dream of life
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Blood on the T.V., ten o'clock news.
Pierre Clementi, snot full o' cocaine.
they're calling to you
Why must we pray screaming?
What about it, you're gonna leave me,
Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon
And the people have the power
Space monkey, so outta line-line.
So please stand back now and let time tell you.
There will be trumpets
Holy Tangiers, holy Moscow, holy Istanbul
Guide my eyes and steps
Love is a ring, the telephone
Nothing to be
Baby got big and baby get bigger.
Scoop the pearls up from the sea
And he's coming to get me. Here I go.
If you're hungry you're not too particular about what you'll taste.
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
to twist in my hand
Hal fell with the fever
Land, land
Got no recollection of my past reflection,
A lift. A lift. On your citizen ship. 
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
assaulted it seems
When questioned who had sent for him,
And he was told but these few words,
[Refrain]
the sense of you surrounds
Holy ours, bodies suffering magnanimity
Marie and Ruth but to tell you the truth
I was lost, and measure for measure,
On that day
Fast asleep
Living in steps
love spewed from the heart of me.
Baby gotta move to the center of my brain,
fame is fleeting God is nigh
how vagrant hearts relent prevail
Dressed in scraps
She is benediction
Let's go under again
Baby wants somethin', she's in the mood to
Which opened up his heart,
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
With doubt the vicious circle
Oh my brain I got to complain
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
Well, and the armies ceased advancin'
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Pissing in a river, watching it rise
Through the dorsal spine and down and around
Exploding dawn
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.
we shoot our flint into the sun
Blood and light runnin'. It's all like a dream.
Positive (anarchy must exist.)
where I have yet to roam
and he arose his blood aflame
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria.
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine
active patrol
As I declare to you
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring
He answered with his thumb,
(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
the life in his fingers unwound my existence
Baby got it but baby want more
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn young.
Let's close our eyes and call the deep
In the towers of gold
can but do for you
Here I go from my body.
and your humankind becomes as one
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something
Light is dancing again
the hollow horn
She is concentrating on
‚ÄúI won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,
They were dreaming crazy dreams
Humans are running, lavender room.
Shall we divide and become another
Because the night belongs to lust
The anal cavity, her cranium
It's all for man
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Their flowers on an average (on the seed?)
The hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you.
till I a raven be
Up there, up there, up there.
Does the sea dream (I'm sure)
(His fingers)
before our feet a feather drifts
why must we guard anything at all
Gone gone, gone gone, good-bye.
oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
the sculptor's mallet has been taken in place
Tayi, taya, it leaves two feet
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)

and they saw nothing
Many is the time I knelt in the light
Frederick and Vitalie, savior dwells inside of thee.
Hi hello
We like birdland.
Are we dancing again
Oh da oh da oh da oh da oh da oh da
From the forest
Baby's got somethin' she's not used to
My soul surrenders
and they wrapped themselves around me
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Don't hesitate now
And the boy was just standing there alone
But I'm with you
What is it, Father ... [?]
Crack it open
With a throat smooth as a lamb
To the one I love.
some giveth their land
Take this message
I was feeling sensations in no dictionary
I was caught like a moth with its wings outta sync.
You made me, you made me feel good and oh I, it's nothing
Folding her wings will you remember me
and then all will be fine
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
Your days are numbers
Don't you see when you're looking at me
The scroll of ancient lettuce. 
sow their seed into the wind
So mournful that the dove just laughs the steadfast gasps
I seek the nerves under your skin. 
The voice is holy, the hearers are holy, the ecstasy is holy
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
From the bright storm
And take you through the stratosphere
I have a winter's tale
Or would you confuse
In the wheel and wing
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
on my mind was nothing at all
Is it any wonder crying in the sun
the sky just opens
Oh no, I don't think so, no
Stretch out your arms now tip and swing,
like piranhas in a stream
Deep in the heart of
I was listening they were saying this and saying that
And the tower bells chime, "ding dong" they chime
cross again
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back
oh-oh
[?]
feel the glow
Stateless, they got shame.
God, do not seize me please, till victory.
It doesn't matter much to me
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet
Holy the miracles, holy the eyeball, holy the abyss
In a light to last a whole life through
Show your papers, boy.
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.
If you called
Total abandon, ooh, walla walla walla,
In the end the end
oh there are places I agree
Ooh I'll put my spell on her
And it's wild wild wild wild
in all that I saw
white shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
Holy Peter, holy Allen, holy Solomon, holy Lucien
Armageddon, it's gotten
slipped away
Igniting like every form of light
go down to the sea
And my baby is walkin' through the door
Holy the cocks of the grandfathers of Kansas
It's all so predestined. It's all such a game for my
Lama was a young man
But my heart obscured the view
Let's go under where the sun beams
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me.
for the sake of their coat
we commend into the wind
Forsaking equatorial bliss
There is no sea but the sea
Fingers, fingers encircling thee
oh till death do us part
space monkey. Sign of the time-time
Emptiness
alive I awoke
(the spoon)
Oh I am waiting for you,
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
to bridge the clouds
I I that's how I
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
and he beheld fields of gold his land his sun
We have the power
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
Hand of God, and I start to whirl
I wish someone would send me energy.
He saw his face
We're still marching for Algiers. Marching, marching for Algiers.
Forgive them Father
and a strange way of breathing
Surely dance
Who walked through the callow mist
A sleeping Marine
(three steps...)
the storm that brings harm
I'm in the mood to And I'm a woman and an individual
(Holy the bop)
Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow
We do not eat,
lo I turned my neck toward home.
Hope streaking the canvas sky
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
And check out the planets there and then take you down
There will be silence
I was a vision
every other tear
"Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me."
until I can rest
It started hardening in my hand
we bless our spoils and we're gone we're gone
We buried him by the river
(like mad pituitary glands)
But what the hell, I fell, I fell.
Na na na na na
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
Is the public acclaim
And I lit a cigarette for your brother.
Eat the summer cannibals
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
And refuse a hand to me
Love is, love was, love is a manifestation.
(I swear on your eyes no pretty words will sway me)
just got too damn rough
looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
Don't turn your back now, I'm talking to you
Have you seen death swimming
I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun. 
The transformation of waste
What you pay for these riches and fame
Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off 
Rude up thy bird, tayi, tayi.
It's all elemental
the ambassador of dreams, the prince of peace.
Where the pure air recognized
And each day you'll grow
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,
Don't want sympathy.
Isabella, we are dying.
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
come a mist an aire so appealing
Film survives. Eyes cry.
that I could go
Oh, sweet revenge
He must be reconnected via shit, at all cost.
Known
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
help thinking that smile
What could I do
Flag on a match head
With a mind that multiplied
hearts will mend
Get yourself an electric guitar
Toward another
A stranger comes up to him; hands him an old, rusty Polaroid.
Wave thou are white
in our snow-white shrouds
Rules and regulations to me, me
To recall what I had found
Wave thou art high
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Feel, feel my heart expanding,
Just for work just to get a job
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,
Oh, look around you, all around you,
the sea's the possibility
Yeah, well, I'll be seein' ya, goodbye, bye
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
I was looking for you
Your soul was like a network of spittle,
Lord, I do extol Thee, for Thou has lifted me.
United children
Nodding tho the lamp's lit low, nod for passers underground.
and the cost didn't matter to me.
And the needle shiftin' like crazy,
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
And the planets will shift,
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Desire to dance;
another piece of meat
to illume thy night
Her vessel, every woman is a vessel, is evasive, is aquatic.
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,
And I know it's hard sometimes,
I want another.
Come move in another dimension
A light upon the swarm
Voices voices mesmerize
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter
What about it, I never doubted you
and our children are being blown away like wishes in the wind
As I move upon the slate
cause darling you died
And the scalp inside is a scalp of 
You can refrain but I'm gonna do something
Oh, the path leads to the sun. Brother, sister, time has come.
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
Aah [?]
we sat for a while he was very engaging
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer
will he come back come back to me
Even those that fall
And I know it's hard sometimes
What is it, Father, I can tell what I like
All my earthly dreams are shattered,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
The air is filled with the moves of you,
Looking at the shiny red tractor
All the lacy lights
Hungry dreaming going west
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,
Melt down in the sun
In the sky a broken flag, children wave and raise their arms.
Gripping my senses
Dead to the world my body was sleeping
Space monkey, sort of divine-vine.
Everlasting, ever new
Break it up, break it up, break it up ...
Little blue dreamer go to sleep
Ah, damn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn.
The cauldron was a-bubbling
Who is due for gift upon gift
He opened his throat (your eyes)
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
before his time time shook
We left behind on the road
Oh a little insane
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn.
Wave up the Earth, one turn around.
God knows a pure view
There is no keeper but the key
and I was free
I'm movin' in this here atmosphere, well, anything's allowed
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.
Save the need
grips the sky
and be Thee, be Thee.
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,
riding on a copper wave.
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I was a wing in heaven blue
The driver was approaching
Is it heaven
Mouth of a cave, I'm a slave I'm free.
It's all gonna split his skull
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
Baby got it and baby begged for it, baby
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
space monkey. Sign of the time-time.
hello friend [X4]
But we were looking fine
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
Child of Iran
It was really great because there was about a billion people there
This is just...this just-a...this just-a...
Are you ready to behave?
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
Every move I made I move to you,
We explore the men's room.
it on the radio Baby got it but baby want more
The beckoning sea
Hey Man don't breathe on my feet
I merge with the people of the hills
Thick heart of stone
The eye is winking
Hand of God, I feel the finger,
They belong to me, me
Little blue bird that offers flight
bottomless pit
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh.
Heading for a spin
And I swim through
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
Hey, Lord, I'm waitin' for you.
We can turn the world around
Nobody gets nothing
Everywhere
Really it was really wonderful, I really felt happy, It really made me happy
Baby, baby, baby was a rock-and-roll nigger.
Oh, to owe not anyone
Nothing to fear
but the movie kept moving as planned
Oh look at me aah
Paths that cross
And the name of the band is the
Victory. Till victory. [repeat]
and when he was gone I was gone on a smile
Across the country through the fields
Total abandon, ooh wah
In the straw-colored light
Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl
The flame of wisdom
It will serve us
Oh, in your starry eyes, baby,
Like cream the waters rise
Ain't got a passport.
Where wishes fall
I was dreamin' in my dreamin'
Women all standing with a shock on their faces.
In a pretty red dress
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,
As the 12th station
By the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed 
With none to laugh or criticize
His father died and left him a little farm in New England.
And like Shakespeare's child
When I'm with you
Served it up with love
Well, I move in another dimension
I been walking
I turned my back walked away
As you go, as you go
The waving of hands
I died
all I ever wanted
You'd be amazed
All of the power
Name
Another lost horizon
Like Shakespeare's child
Voice of the Swarm
Feel so fucked up
(they knew what they were after)
The sifting cloth is binding, and the dream she weaves will never end.
Went to my room, started to cry.
And then I hear this knockin' on my door
About a boy
The gas had inflicted her entire spine
Space monkey, so out of line and it's all just space, just space.
They're singing, "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine."
Deep in the heart of your brain is a lever
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
Boy hesitatin', jack-knife.
Oh you know, I would go anywhere at all
People say "beware!"
I haven't fucked much with the past, 
The light fades

Counting the time, then you came to my room

Oh, God, I'm waitin' for you;
What is it, Father, you can't tell what I like.
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,

Goodbye, goodbye sir, goodbye papa

He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be

In the presence of my enemies,
As I move thru seven levels
I'm coming to you

And he's mine, mine, all mine.
Lift up your unto me.
And the shepherds [?] the soldiers

But when I was waving to you, the way your face was, it was so
Heard it on the radio, it's no good

When are you coming ? Hope you come soon
Of the wicked hand you played
Wisdom was a teapot

Everything is soakin' and spread with butter
Oh I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,

Where God's get lost

Now it's me that's got precious little to say
What is it, Father, holy that night?
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,
May the blanket of Kings
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
from the earth's four corners the people are calling
Grave visitations
the hungry earth
And I have no guilt. 
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,
When I see Brancusi

All communion is not holy

Peace to your brother, give and take peace,
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right.
The heart that breaks the dawn, Amen
My sins my own
Holy time in eternity, body, holy eternity in time
And my heart, Isabella.

Ah, there were tags all over my sleeve.
Don't get dizzy, do not fall now,
Love's pretty, love's pretty cruel tonight.
From the thickening blackmail of elephantiasis
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.
Gently pulled his finger
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
Here she comes
Oh, oh-oh. Down and down.
And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
Lead me, oh, lead me.

Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,
Ahh the borders of heaven
Of an aspect bright and fair
Have you seen death singing
You said when you were with me that nothing made you high.
Within the context of neo rock we must open up our eyes and seize and rend the veil of smoke which man calls order.

And we marched on toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers

ghost of thy ghost
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
And I got this crazy feeling that I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
Hipsters, peace and junk and dreams

It's wild wild wild wild
And mother I did what I could
Oh you'll ride
Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
I stood alone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
To say hello.
Steps we take
And I whirl, and I whirl,

On a life rapidly fading
Rend the veil and we shall sail.
She is addicted to thee

Oh, I was undulating in the lewd impostered night.
I won't wait around if I was you you
Rise up hold the reins
Who will decide the shape of things

Where there were deserts, I saw fountains
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered
What is it, Father, are you into shape
And if a mama bird you see

On the twenty-fifth floor.

In a room in Lebanon

Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance
High time, I was taking my revenge
And the sky split and the planets hit,

The world is holy, the soul is holy
But I don't care
I am the sword, the wound, the stain.
Holy forgiveness, mercy, charity, faith

Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff.
Beyond it all
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.

Is it any wonder they're spitting at the sun
Everyone, silver ecstatic, platinum disk spinning
We joined the long caravan
We drank all night together and you began to cry so recklessly.
Heard it on the radio, it's news to me
Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
and it all got too damn much for me
I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it
Ain't got a chance, sport, at fortune and fame.
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there

Out of the shadows
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.

Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
We shall live again, we shall live.
There must be something I can dream tonight,
I am helium raven and this movie is mine,
Jersey.
And the cause is you lookin' up at me.
God or the law
We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly, 
The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,

With their broken schemes and their lotteries
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight
Whose bone scraped, whose flesh unfurled
In all I do

Holy Kerouac, holy Huncke, holy Burroughs, holy Cassady

Little blue shoes that walk across the sky
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack.
Oh honey you met your match in a bitch
Meltin' in a pot of thieves
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
Over the cloud, over the bridge,

Too startled to try.

There was a wicked messenger
Who will decide
Vengeful aspects became suspect
I watched the litter pile like a wall
And they come and they call and they fall on the floor
Light is dancing like a flame
if you see me walking
I believe I'll be taking my revenge
they spread themselves before me
I, I, I, I, I, how are you? how are you?
And in the mountains a cry echoes
man's own kin
Just a boy
And the heart's communion
wherefore am I walking
Listen to my story

On the hill, hear us call through a realm of sound.
I saw, I saw you from your balcony window and

We'll be gone but they'll go on and on and on and on and on.
we expressed such sweet vows
Baby calm down, better calm down,
All those mint bushes around you
Deep in my heart

Space monkey, so out of line and he's mine, mine, oh he's mine
In the form of shinin' valleys
oh I whispered will you ever return
I'm waiting here to refuel.
Well I was hopin' in my hopin'
Into the light of reunion
A silk of souls
Erase and blend
Everything is holy, everybody's holy, everywhere is holy
Who will perceive
The inspired sky amazed to stumble
Angels howl at those abstract lights
The nature of my blues
Hope dashed immortal hope
the heavens fed
In my glove
What is it, Father, that brings me down
Little blue star that offers light
the Egyptian field
They circled around me
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway.
Here I go and I don't know why
And I spin, come down thru time
From the field
that let me astray
cause your love flows
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
dying and drying as I rise tonight.
My bowels are empty, excreting your soul
I was lost, and the cost,
Who pray to return to salute
seven steps
As the young thrush
And I lit a match and the void went flash
there was a man
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,
I just don't know what to do tonight,
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue
Is entwined
the coming and dying of the moon
Like a kamikaze
All that hearts desire
bone of my bone
But I've fucked plenty with the future. 
oh he would shift he would not shift at all
I wanna hear it, I wanna score (poppies) I wanna hear
Threw out your shoe over the soil,
I and I alone
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
Nothing good was coming I just stood there
in another eye
No one heard that cry,
And baby baby I'll show you the way
We waltzed beneath motionless skies
In the sheets
Oh it's such a lovely game
You ain't gonna need no, you ain't gonna need no little boat
Dust of scenes
But in the land of the Impala
There's no use faking it
Angels appear
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?
Holy New York, holy San Francisco
Citizen ship we got mem'ries.
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
Because tonight there are two lovers
What is it, Father, that moves to the right?
Here I go and I don't know why,
I see it all before me.
(in the heart of man)
I rend, I end, I return.
Wave to the city
Oh no, I don't think so
With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed. 
On boundaries over this world
you lay in the fields of grain
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
Up up up up up up
Where the dervish turns
Space monkey, sort of divine.
They know not what they do
I feel upset
Isabella, we are rising . . .
When day is done and little dreamers spin
when we'll be as one
And I'm gonna tell the world that I just ah-ah made her mine
One foot extended, snake to the ground,
In the heart of the ancient
In a ring
Mother as I write the sun dissolves
Ahh the equation
The madman is holy as you my soul are holy
I could hear the angel calling.
Who digs Los Angeles is Los Angeles
My heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
Exchanging visions, layin' arms
Holy the sea, holy the desert, holy the railroad
Oh people of Ethiopia
The shift of being
I, I, well I'm just clumsy, yeah, no, it's just a band-aid, no, it's okay
and when it rains
Come come come come come come for me oh
Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money,
beyond us it will fall
The night to exploit.
Holy the hideous human angels
What is it that calls to us?
Turn, Lord, (strange)
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Comin' through my door
I know soon still that platinum is coming
Blind alley in New York City, in a foreign embrace.
Up there, up there, up there,
seven sweet disguises, seven ways of serving Thee.
We can hold on (I'm sure)
Mannah from Heaven from the most high,
From a chaos
And he put up his hands and he said, ‚ÄúIt's me, it's me,
Motor city
Awake
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
Weaving tho the eyes are pale, what will rend will also mend.
I spin, I spiral, and I splatter
And white opals swimming
warrior cried
It's gonna be all right
Let's do some celebrating
Because the people had their ear
I was lost in the infinite sea.
