When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Strange strange
Some strange music draws me in
It's real nice to talk to you, I didn't
Heard it on the radio Won't be no need for layin' in the road
When I don't get it, I get blue, blue
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day
Then moved by bold design
[chorus]
For the ghosts of our love have dried, have died
or the color of their skin
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
And free the hurricane, oh, I go into the center of the airplane
if you seek the kingdom come, come along
Oh, into the center of my brain and baby come, baby go
eat eat eat
Tattoo fingers shy away from me
I cried, "Break it up, oh, now I understand.
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble
Because the night belongs to us
He fills me up again
(there is nothing happening at all)
Light of my life, he's dressed in flame.
And I look up into the big tower clock
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
I was lost, and the cost
is the wind that howls
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And straw-colored curls a-turning
I just don't know what to say to him. I just don't know.
Snow started falling,
A stage is like each bolt of wood, 
I was lost in a valley of pleasure.
Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,
spirit moaned
Baby get something. Baby get more.
Women all standing with shock on their faces.
and those by fate denied
the girls a-saying grace
Oh, the cradle was our call. When it rocked we carried on.
In heart I'm an American artist, 
Recognize my face?
But now my hair itself is a veil, 
In the medieval night
Come on. Set me free
(his vocal chords shot up)
Citizen ship we got mem'ries
soared over the ocean
Hey you. come here. get up.
Holy the groaning saxophone, holy the bop apocalypse
Send it deep in the heart of you
I was a pawn
Oh, and my senses newly opened
Car stopped in a clearing,
'Twas love's design
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
People have the power
Its destination ever changing
we lay down into the wind
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,
And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
Wild wild wild wild [X3]
I saw the boy break out of his skin.
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
I would give all
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel." 
The sexual streets, why it's all so insane.
I needed nobody
all will be well
(I feel it swirling around me
In a single
And woe to the sun
That's because of the sound [?]
Oh I have some information for you
I like to watch you when you're walking back and forth on the beach
And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
Where you're not human, you are not human.”
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
appealing to all that I know
Oh, I'm pissing in a river.
We just forged on
till death do us part
Some wail at walls
This dead city longs to be free
forming equations but the questions are hard
Who that person could possibly be
Pretty little girl, everyone cried.
My heart Oh
Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling,
Find a ticket, win a lottery.
I'm gonna make contact tonight.
Up there, down there
She, intoxicated by thee
I saw it floating in the river
It was a crying shame
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi
he gave them his bread
started laughing hysterically
Easter Sunday, we were talking.
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.
He's delighted to love me, but you know,
we'll bare our arms as wings
In the soul of the desert
a warrior died
Don't say nothing no
Who, who am I?
spirit shed
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so
I'm floating in a door backward
And I know you got the feeling,
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop.
My love he breathed the air of kings
anything at all
Toward a wisdom
One of fallen glory
nothing at all
Talking communion ...
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need.
The way your face was, it made me feel exactly like we're
Outside of society. [Repeat]
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,
In a child's leather purse
Don't avert your eyes
Got two tales to tell
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
Here a man man's own kin
We can turn the earth's revolution
thy moans
And so he seized the first
Love in my heart.
and a rainbow appears
What's the mad matter with the church chimes?
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
He is levitating with she ...
I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star,
and the mother cries "Why they taken my son?"
From the vast portals
I seek pleasure. 
Their eyes for his eyes
I thought you were some perfect read-out
and the air the viscous air
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,
What is it, Father, I can tell you one night
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
On the citizen ship we got mem'ries
What is it children that falls from the sky?
should I return to thee
Give me your wartorn and your
(baby worship something)
Make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine
Turn, God, God (strange)
Angel looks down at him and says, “Oh, pretty boy,
Where duty calls
that's how I
who stands guard for each other
Oh, the stars shine so suspiciously
thinking those tears are yours
He throws back his head
Toward a dream
And then they laid her on the table
I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You.
And we strolled there together
And walls I've caressed. 
Madness overflowed
I tuned in (to the tower) too many centuries
Boy boy
Citizen ship, we got pain.
Speak to me
Wave thou art pretty
grateful soul he's gone again
I'll die for Allah
and as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble
all heaven's glory turned in your eyes
I fell on my knee
To waste in the dust
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
Everything I've done, I've done for you
With a strange way of walking
Dream Of Life
We'll go to the pagoda
Thieves, poets we're inside out
She is connecting with he
The sphinx awakens
Take my hand come undercover
the sky is high
And my head, Isabella.
Baby wants somethin', I want more
Oh sleeping sun
round the bend
we raise our arms to him on night
Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship
I laid in the rushes the air was upon me
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man,
Aww clean clean it out
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A,
He sings of youth enraged
Round and round, oh, round and round.
They can't hurt you now,
Your opiate is the air that you breathe
Everyday is in eternity, every man is an angel
I was nothing. It didn't matter to me.
come on darling eat
Toward a river
it pours
And to re-create from excretion of man pure and then soft and then solid gold.
It's been a hard time
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
Isabel, my little one, take my hand. Time has come.
in foreign alphabet
haunt and moan
be flung into space into another kind of grace
If you see me walking
No [?], don't leave me no space in your little boat
Stoned in space. zeus. christ. it has always been rock and so it is and so it shall be.
I had an ornamental veil, but I couldn't bear to use it. 
And woe to the young
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
We shall live again, we shall live again,
As I lay down into my sleepin'
living in steps
Come back come back come back
We do not eat
I was so forsaken
First, freedom
Hear it on the radio, goddamn in my radio,
But what can she say
Baby gotta go to the center of my brain
It's up there, down there
You got a piece and hit across the sky
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad.
oh-oh oh oh
Heaven in flux
The earth we grind
In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true.
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
What more can I give you? Baby I don't know
You are living on my time, my dear
There's no burning where the sun beams
Coming in the airport, coming in the sea,
Take me forever, it doesn't matter
The winds ablaze
And let it deep in
Here we are, Father, Lord, Holy Ghost,
cause time will bid and make us rise
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
And go Johnny go and do the watusi,
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Dust off the words that shaped from the tale.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
Because the night belongs to lovers ...
Baby want more
And these words, these words
I'm not listening."
'Cause he was not human, he was not human.
and if there's one thing
(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)
Come and join me, I implore thee,
thy sighs
they silently slept
Wrap my legs 'round you,
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
no future at all
Baby, I know our troubles will be gone.
Citizen ship you got pain.
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Oh no, I don't believe so, no
all things renew
that's where you'll find me.
into the glare of all out little wars
Let's go waltzing on the water
My dove
She is the root connection
Give me your tired, your poor
Wisdom and compassion crushed
It was blood shining in the sun
no, not sympathy.
Ask the angels while they're falling
And you were standing there, waving at everybody
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing
We were broke as well.
there's a cross on the road
Lucky young boys
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
I have not sold myself to God.
not want to get involved in it all
Legions of light, virtuous flight. Ignite, excite.
I bolted the door and whispered oh well
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.
Your thoughts your schemes
Ladies' lost electricity;
and in his heart a yearning yet
Lullaby tho baby's gone. Lullaby a broken song.
The palm trees fall into the sea,
Sixty-eight it broke up the yardbirds.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
What is it, Father, in your eye,
Could it be he's taking over me...
alive alive I awoke
Please, oh oh won't you return?
I recall the wonder of it all
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself
From the meek the graces shower
of we three?
And war war is the battle cry
And I go to this here party and I just get bored
Couldn't measure up my love for you, it's so immaterial
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing
So I'm free to move in the resurrection.
We shall live again.
I opened my coat but he never came closer
your wartorn
There is no land but the land
To the Port of Marseilles
he turned his back and his own people shot him
Seeking love without exception
But my dream it lingered near
Why must not death be redefined?
Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Pray for your brother.
You say you want me.
And the dust the endless dust
Souls are invaded, heart in a groove.
With a green vapor, made her feet light
Twisting like silver swans
Oh, don't you know that anyone can join
Cast adrift from the citizen ship, 
he gave them his land
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
He'll be there too
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,
as the street beneath my feet
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.”
And it's wild wild wild wild.
Sweet sweet revenge
They call me broken glass.
Flower of creation.
No line of death no boundaries
You say you wish for me.
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Picked up my key, didn't reply.
and send you a smile
Waiting underground [X6]
Ain't got my real name.
the time has arrived
Voices voices beckoning sea
Softly go
Astonished tie death
How long how long will we make do
and he fell on his knees
Some call it the sun
And I awakened to the cry
Feel, see your blue lights are flashing,
And they'll all go together
seize the sky and they're gone again
Time for communion
Come on darlin'
I am calling
to all eternity
Wake from thy sleep
The world's roof was raging
Jimi Hendrix was a nigger.
My body is aching.
Come come come come come come
And the sky was open
lo I turned under his spell
Upon a [?]
I have to go
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner
Hal died in my arms
Deep inside of your ship.
it rains on me
World ending, it's just beginning
People rising from the highway
What's your name? ...
Feel, feel my heart expanding
blessed is the grass
There is no leopard and the lamb
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean.
And world war is the battle cry
Oh I am waiting for you, oh I am waiting for you,
said hello friend
What you get is the public acclaim
Like a plague it covered everything
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers
beneath the pilgrim moon
but when it rains
Well listen now to what I say
You must rid yourself from these, these animal fixations
It's no mystery
waitin' to open Your ninety-eight wounds
Beatin' and beatin' so outta time.
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
When, when will you be landing?
laid a compass deep
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move
I don't think (after station) there's any station
strong and happy be sure
And you were reflected
Ah, this is the era where everybody creates.
Coming in a force field, coming in my brain
Waltzin' through the hall
From Eli he did come,
like a voice that knows it's gone
Down in Vineland there's a clubhouse,
Little sister, the fates are calling on you.
And oh. you were so good, oh, you were so fine
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Holy the jazz bands, marijuana
Come move in another dimension oh oh oh
And he turned and heard me say so desp'rately,
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,
It's decreed the people rule
My heart pumping, my heart pumping, my heart pumping
Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
She was the victim of sweet suicide.
Lower the thing the skin of a cat
and the corn still grows
some seeking answers
you're cast, you're cast away.
Are we sleeping
they'd never wake again
Angels howling
Spread its wings and fly away
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
oh-oh oh to you
An afixiation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree
Hey Sheba, hey Salome, hey Venus eclipsin' my way ah.
Oh I am waiting for you
How the presence of you shines
