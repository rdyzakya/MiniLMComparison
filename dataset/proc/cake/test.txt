I will survive,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa It's all behind you now,
You've got your grand piano
I don't think that I'll ever be the same If I threw my guitar
Should I close the door? Up so close I never get to see your face.
But how you can you say you'll be happy
I've got all my life to live.
How can you say, the future's in the palm, in the palm of your hand? You won't admit you love me
so sick of me
He is calling you "DUDE!" Now do you believe
I won't be soothed. Dis empowered, the scattering flock
She opened the door quietly and stepped into the night.
And, and these disc jockeys,
At the very last second I can change directions
Not way over in a bucket seat Alright
He knows about your party
The same ones that I'm drowning in
You invite your friends to tea
You won't even pick me up
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
I know you need it, girl
It's almost like my life will fall,
If you ever lose your mind
But she was much brighter
You need to straighten your posture and suck in your gut.
We are making a brand
But under my hood is internal combustion power
Learn to buck up Now simple feet that flicker like fire
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Now, now, learn to buck up
Na na, na na, na
All the things I feel about you
Goats...go to hell I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip
Who's gonna steal the show, you know?
Keep on doing it
You can access information, make them see that you're the best
Your demons would all be around
What this world is searching for
And a trunk that can carry the heaviest of loads I've got a mind that can steal me to your house
Right, shut the fuck up, hey, ho
I want a girl who knows what's best
Strategize this presentation, make them see that you're the man Man, man, man You'll receive the federal funding, you can pass the simple test
And tomorrow today
Stop the way I feel about you
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
I don't want you jumping unless this music's thumping
And you see me
When your castles turn to sand Take a bite of this apple
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones? As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.
Dances in a fever at the castle rock
Sealed away from my sins
(Too much) Too much carbon monoxide for me to bare I don't want to wonder if this is a blunder
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
Tight jaw
Hear my motor purr
I want a girl with good dividends
every city that you plan
Why walk in circles?
I don't want to be with you) Every little dance
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
Say it all Say it all,
They'll never find you now,
Well a lot of good cars are Japanese
His cigarette is burning
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
You tell me that you care
Then pouring it slowly and steady
nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
I want to love you, love you, love you madly I don't want to fake it, I just want to make it
Let let me go Mahna mahna
On their knees the war pigs crawling
You're moving on, on, on.
Oh not I,
Cuts swatches out of all material. ou turn the screws
It's coming down Aw no
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby, I realize
He will make you cry Something keeps him moving
I don't want to be with you I'm so sick of you
She's gone and she's wearing your red sweater
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of.
You'd never have believed it
When the waves retire to the darkness below,
And there's nothing I can say to you
And it's all vanity. We are building a religion
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns 'Cause he's going the distance
There's an aching deep inside
Evil minds that plot destruction
Making lines across the darkening sky And when the sun is going down I can take a taxi into town
You sell it to Japan
I don't want to see you without it You've given me much more
Learn to buck up Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife
As long as I know how to love
Are you feeling, feeling okay, baby? Uh huh
Satan is the only one who seems to understand
You're drinking what they're selling.
Though my record may say it
You'd burn all these dying leaves Without the pretty pink ribbon
They're wondering where you went to when you told them you'd be here I have wasted so much time
Daria, I won't be soothed.
Walk across the room
By a car or by a plane or anything not yet invented I'm a dime
Only eight more hours to go
Is all because of me This long line of cars
I am determined not to be dented
Here, right here, my dear
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor She'll hang the baskets on the wall
I know I know Ruby sees all.
By fastening your safety belts
Winter's light left me in the dark last night
She's touring the facilities and picking up slack
All the things I feel
People just getting lazy, complaining Arco Arena
All the music that you own
Pendant key chains To me
And there's nothing I can do (Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude)
It would be easy It would be easy, so easy
I don't want to think about it, I don't want to talk about
He's got a gold watch
The barber can give you a haircut
You're never ever ever ever there
And picking up slack
I don't have to look no more And all of my days
I don't want to
I can see that clearly now,
I have waited for her for so long
I've got all my love to give
Who look at your face from more than one angle
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
But it's not that I don't love you
Punk rock
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na Take your economy car and your suitcase
Mahna mahna Two, three, four People you love
All alone (All alone!) In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes
i stand on painted tape
Let me go she said
But I've got my doubts Oh baby
To me
Now Heads of state who ride and wrangle
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
But unless I get up,
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?
I'm so tense
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle? Excess ain't rebellion.
And we can still begin again And if the doubting faces made you go
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot
[REPEAT]
When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea I want to love you madly
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa Alcohol, cigarettes and luxury goods,
Microscope I might as well be out in space.
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor He'll go to buy her turtle wax
Piecemeal of yesteryear,
Still in love with you.
But To me
You'd never have believed
Beyond your latest ad campaigns
I only shut my mouth.
I'm not catching on fire today
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor She'll hang the baskets on the walls
You're never there
My intentions are good and earnest and true
The one for me was you,
Yeah if you want to have cities, you've got to build roads.
Goats go to hell
Just feeling sorry for myself.
Where you stand now were tools in a basement and How can you say, forever, is at your command?
The man on the street might just as well be Outside, outside the world
She's putting up her hair
That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors [Chorus[
For you Without the pretty pink ribbon
I've got seats that selflessly hold my friends
Red white and blue,
I don't need another day I'm so sick of work
Red white and blue You turn the screws
And I shine
And long ago somebody left with the cup
Yow, yow, yow
Wandering the night,
The words you'll soon be saying
Yeah, excess ain't rebellion.
In a room all filled with Chinese lamps He saves what others throw away
Girl, you got it
Not quite believing
A faintly glimmering radio station
Let me go and I will want you When she wants, she wants the sun
Is trying to get through
Than somber thoughts of burning planets (Shut the fuck)
That you have got to... You have always got to move,
Ah, in the first place.
After this my lungs will be so fucked up
Somehow being there without you's not the same. It's all behind you now,
If you ever lose your way We are building a religion We are building it bigger We are building A religion A limited Edition We are now accepting callers
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartache Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
For you to get your way,
I wonder if you even miss me Never there
Gives me such a worried mind
Push my face into your hair Cream rinse and tobacco smoke
I'd have the music high going ninety five Too much
The land where you can't change lanes
Don't you know I've seen it all before She'll hang the baskets on the walls
You have no reason to be gone
she puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag
And I spent oh so many nights
Do you
Timing your contractions
Or a serene translucent lake.
You've got to build roads. Do you think she's swimming in your lies?
But now I hold my head up high
I have wasted so much time He is like a politician who is practicing a speech
That's right
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year You should've told me when it all began
And Jingle Bells are smothered in this gloom. Winter's trees freezing in the bitter wind
I sing to Verdi's grave And every single morning
They laugh they make money
I was bound for Mexico
Or should I close the door? Yea, my eyes are burning in my head
She wants a car that will get her there
In your onion head hat We are building a religion
mirror image of a silver sky,
But no one seems to know
You can dress up like a sultan
I learned how to get along.
He said i gave myself to enjoy pleasure
I am really only praying that
I was bound to let you go I had a match
Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you. Up your nose down to your toes.
But you don't know which page to turn to
So deep in the night
Treating like people just like pawns in chess
Your virtues would all go unknown
I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give
They're applying purple eyeshadow, drinking warm beer
(Shut the fuck)
And then I ask you over again
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip And the gravedigger puts on the forceps
You'll never really kill it.
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in
And it gives me such a thrill 'Cause I found
Go ahead and destroy this
You want it, confront it, just open your window
You should see you're headed for a storm.
Than words could ever say
I don't want to sit across the table from you wishing I could run I want to love madly
Your cancers would eat to the bone Your muscles would bulge underground
They have judgment
Oh yeah
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
When she gets what she wants,
I was in your mattress back in 1982. Daria, I won't be soothed.
As the sky begins to darken and the waves begin to roll
And something in my mind just got away
The land where large fuzzy dice still hang proudly
It's what you choose to do
The air is so hot
She's mad and she'll take her mattress with her
I need to fly away (I'm so sick of you
And Satan is my motor
I don't want to doubt you, know everything about you
Somebody
And then she's right there next to me I need you here with me
I count the many times I've said
Exchanging glances
I'm waiting for these memories to begin If I threw my guitar
But he never seems to notice
Who's fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
