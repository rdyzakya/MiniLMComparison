And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup
ALL SMALL We all are small.
Now look what you did!
I bet with my net

And our fish came down too.

Was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath.
These stockings he grinned are the first things to go!
When I wish to make a wish
Stood puzzling and puzzling: How could it be so?
He picked up the cake
On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Look sir. Look sir. Mr. Knox sir.
its a tweetle beetle puddle battle.
Two things. And I call them
Mr. Brown upside down.
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter

Some have six feet and some have more.
Not on a train! Not in a tree!
Said the cat with a bow.
You will like these two things
Thats a noise grinned the Grinch That I simply MUST hear!

PAT PAT they call him Pat.
When he comes in I put him out.
Think of something to do!
Whod got out of bed for a cup of cold water.

Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant
You never yet met a pet I bet
NIGHT FIGHT We fight all night.
My poor mouth is much too slow sir.
These yellow pets are called the Zeds.
Not with a mouse. Not with a fox.
And the ship and the fish.
This one has a little car.

Said the fish to the cat.
And what happened then? Wellin Whoville they say

But he is out. So have no fear.
Bump! Bump! Bump!
Dont ask us why go ask your mother.
I like to hop all day and night.
STOP You must not hop on Pop.
But that is not all.
It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.
Then he shut up the Things
Eat a snack with Brown and Black.
Then he growled with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming
Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more!
Not in a house.
green eggs and ham!
Hop hop! I hop right back again.
Then our fish said Look! Look!
Lucks duck licks lakes.

She stared at the Grinch and said Santy Claus why????????????
On his head he had a hook.
Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
WHERE IS BROWN? THERE IS BROWN!
