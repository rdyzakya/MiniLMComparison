Slow motion, I'm watching our love
Move along with the truth
I never learned how to swim now If being wrong's a crime
We keep trying to talk about us
The only love I haven't screwed up
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing Go all the way
Not sleeping is one
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Meet somebody, take 'em home
We crave a different kind of buzz
There's nothing more cruel
Uh oh, Uh oh Easy, easy
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Can I kill it with you?
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
You're the only friend I need
But it wasn't my fault
Tripping in the bathroom
Where everything is good [Verse 2:]
The ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder Now the days are getting cooler, and the burning of our limbs
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Losing proposition
The whole world knows but you
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
Do your thing, do it well
I'm tired of traitors
Well guess why? I like that
Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon Hard feelings
This is how we get notorious, oh
At the swingin' party down the line Bring your own lampshade
L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S Break the news, you're walking out
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
We move in the tree streets
Behave abnormally Let's let things come out of the woodwork
All the broken glass sparkling
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
Always changing sides
That I thought was out to get me down
Know you won't remember in the morning
It don't run in our blood
These ribbons wrap me up
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar Those great whites, they have big teeth
Thought you said that you would always be in love
How you'd dance for me
To stop this when we're Up for it
Red and chrome
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm faking glory
I'm psycho high
This will not do 'Cause I was raised up
You're not alone in trying to be Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Head out the window again
Uh oh, Uh oh
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
Nothing ever lasts forever
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? You asked if I was feeling it
Supercut of us So I fall
Or you'll be there when I'm the next one's made
But what I really mean is
And make 'em all dance to it (Go back and tell it) Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you
Don't you tell 'em
(Everything feels right) I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
(I wear the robe like no one could) I'll let you in on something big
I live in a hologram with you
Don't you tell 'em what we do (Ohhh..) Don't tell 'em
Easy, easy
Kiss the feet of a sarlatan
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
So I guess I'll go home
How you wish it would be all the time This dream isn't feeling sweet
Lights are on and they've gone home
Every night I go,
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
It's all gone
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know We were down in the hospital
It feels better biting down Listen to the beats resound
(Talk about it) We told you this was melodrama
There's nothing more I want
Everybody wants to rule the world
So there So all the cups got broke
Yeah Only bad people live to see
White teeth teens are out That slow burn wait while it gets dark,
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
It's clear that someone's gotta go
Little black butterflies deep inside me. What would my mamma do?
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
He saw me hurt this way? Uh oh, Uh oh
But it's just a supercut of us
why, why, why
There's just a supercut In your car, the radio up
So I just try to keep up with them
To just a supercut 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
Get what they want
For the love club There's a humming in the restless summer air
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah All work and no play
Not in the swing of things yet Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I call from underwater
I like your reckoning,
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
When you've outgrown a lover
Dancing with our shoes off
It drives you crazy, getting old
In the ambulance you're laughing
Kinda wanna tape my mouth shut
If being strong is what you want
Dancing with us, us (but what will we do when we're sober?) When you get to my high (limelight, lose my mind)
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
You wanted something that we offered
Now you know it's really gonna blow Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
(Oh how fast the evening passes
But victory's contagious No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
I'll find my own bravado It's a switch flipped
Pull out the heart that keeps you
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
We let our battles choose us And the cry goes out (ha oh)
Our bodies are young and blue
I was in but I want out
Precious friend of mine Will I know when it's finally time
Crying in the taxi
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
So take it down There's nothing I want but money and time
When People are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
He saw me hurt this way?
Dreams of clean teeth
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh All of the things we're taking
'Cause I don't know
It's buzzcut season anyway
It feels better biting down
I want them You're the only friend I need
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Grey Goose
'Cause I kinda miss your life fucked
Can we keep up with the ruse?
All fuckin' with our lover's heads
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We're all alone I know we're not everlasting
I'd like it if you stayed And I like you
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Yeah I guess I should go Hard feelings
I'm serving forever
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays) The men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose
They poke around until they
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I still feel you, now and then
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
Don't you worry bout it might gon' work it out Only is you got me feeling like this oohh why,
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Moved 'round our heads
I hate the headlines and the weather
L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S (look out, lovers)
Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
All the gunfights and the limelights
(Place the call, feel it start)
And you know and you know and you know (One, two) Baby really hurt me
Their likeness set in stone
Islands
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
I guess we're partying So let's let things come out of the woodwork
Have another drink, get lost in us
Looks just like a blood orange
(I wear the robe like no one could)
You're all gonna watch me
It drives you crazy, getting old This dream isn't feeling sweet
But my head's filling fast with the wicked games, up in flames
L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S
