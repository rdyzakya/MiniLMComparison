Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Get Up Won't You G'on Down
Gotta Let That Fool Loose Deep Inside Your Soul
Making for my selfish pride
So this one’s for all the lost children
Caring is sharing
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
[ad-libs]
La vérité pour moi
Close your eyes and drift away
Someone called out my name
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
I’m singing for so very long
Electric Eyes Are Ev'rywhere
Signed in your name against the words of God
Or was it my imagination?
There's no need to dismay
Who's bad
Knowing The Girl
Don't You Know Now Is The Perfect Time
I care about mine
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High 
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey
And ya try to make a way to see, what it is i do,
Stand Up! Stand Up!
You better run, you better do what you can
There'll be so much dancing, singing
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando
Invaded by shadows
Don't you send him, just come yourself
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say 
Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
And bring all your troubles to me. 
Morning glow is long past due
Na Na Na-Na Na Na Na Nah!
She's Driving Me Wild
Whne you're feelin' blue
And This Place Could
Who Can't Write Or Read
To hide your hands
I got to get up
Look who's standing if you please
Love To Run My Fingers
[Spoken]
Beautiful morning
And it make me feel like ah,
You try to get me to lose the man I really am
Shorty really wanna be there for me
'Cause ooh... 
There Ain't No Rules It's Up To You (Ain't No Rules It's All Up To You)
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
Those Special Times
You're not here with me
We can make the new day right
Tu amor es mi suerte
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
If This Town
Oh no...
To Get There
As one for numbered numbers
And nothing would cheer you
(Ooh girl let me keep you warm)
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
A Love So Brand New
(Take A Look At Yourself, And
But never two lovers
And bring all your troubles to me
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Built Upon A Sandy Beach
He wanna motormouth
Because There's Something
Haz que me quiera
[Michael] Na Na Na
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
'Cause you are there, 
Just Wait And See
Nobody should be grievin' this way (oh-oh)
Gonna change the world, Sing it
And One Day You'll Discover
And leave my world so cold
Hold my hand
And every night I'll say a prayer, 
I was lost in a world of strangers
We'd Stare
If you just reach out for me girl
To Sorrow
What I can't recall
The Mirror
Can't afford to waste it 
Got to give some loving
Give me a motion 'cause
Love is here
Love is like a circus and a carnival is beautiful to see
And Don't You Pretend We Didn't
We were together most of the time
Why are they never satisfied with all you give, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah
Don’t be messin’ around hey
What about apathy
Together they gather
Hoo! hoo! hoo!
No Excuses To Make
Cause It Ain't Hard To...
To get the story you need, so you can bury me
I Breakdown When I Cry
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
I need your love in my life
Just won't do, ooh baby
You're living on sunset time
A Rather Nation
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
(there's a sign in the window)
A human presence that you feel is strange
Hee hee!
About You Baby
You kill for the money
Got A Mojo
When You're All Alone
But who knows just what the future brings
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh, Wooh, Wooh)
Got A Feelin'
With Tears In Her Eyes
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby
De madrugada
He wanna hot scrub
And welcome her into my world 
She felt as a youth
(A Big Mistake)
The world could not go on so every night I pray
Because Your Words Just Aren't Enough
We'd Stay On The Phone
What are you gonna do?
The sweetness of your kiss
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Just tell me twice and I will see
Get Your Ticket Right . . .
Yes, happiness
There's something in the walls
But not for the missing
(Better Change!)
Jew me, sue me
People can be so cold 
I've got the month of May
If You Promise You'll
Beggin' I Ain't Lovin' You
Nothing can ever get you down
Talk To Me Woman
Up again I never let you down
Then There Ain't No One Who's Gonna Put You Down
The dreams that we're dreaming
Is truth a game daddy
Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper
You'll Never Tell
Only darkness every day 
My Brothers
Those abortion papers (Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
But together we can be alright (alright).
In The Temple
I Don't Need No Dreams When I'm By Your Side
So You Believe In You
The light from the window
you know you did
I'll Be Your Everything
I bumped into you by the corner store
On the moon
(pah dah dah dah)
That twinkle at night
I Feel Your Fever
(Drop a line) 
She's Got
I don't care a jack, or about what cha' do, 
Full euphoria
Remember
This love I have for you girl it’s incredible
The Girl I Could Not Trust
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Will Reveal A Joyful Face
Et si ca stoppe
Pour la première fois
And on the screen today, we're on display (baby)
Would make life beautiful
As you live, you learn though a torch will burn
You rocked my world, you know you did
Thanks to you I finally got a song, 
Hey.
Your forefathers said but they did not do
I don't know why baby!
Break of dawn, girl you got to understand
And you’re running
Je te dirai tout bas
So goodbye with all my prayers
I Was At The Point 
(Hee hee!)
Your Thoughts Of Me Remain
Reaching Out
He hot willed in the face
I can't straighten it out, girl, yeah
For you are not alone...
You Keep changin' the rules
Look at the lonely lovers
It Ain't Too Much
So listen to my heart
I'd probably be by my lonesome
It blows my mind to know
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
For The Willing
Susie got your number
and what will she say? 
'Til the end of time
Oh
At night pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
Who's to trust when living dangerous
animal, hannibal, cannibal addition
Is where your space is
when your children cried last night?
Mi vida no es vida
I Know She'll Tell You I'm The One For Her
I'll Play The Fool For You
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain 
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...
finally found, come on, girl)
The City's Heart Begins To Beat
Come on and... 
So sad, regret it
We're innocently standing by
So don't be feeling this way
I like the way how you're lovin' me
Somebody please have mercy
(Washed-Out Dream)
They try to tell us we're too young
I got it coming baby
They'll Just Go On And On
So let me keep you warm
And She Says . . .
(You are the lady in my life) In my life
I hold the world sings
We shall have music
Just because you're there, 
Feel my sin
It's been my fate to compensate,
And how many children have to die
Is it scary for you baby 
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray 
You help me understand
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
The band start to play
Every Moment Takes Me To Paradise
C'mon And Groove, And Let The Madness In The Music Get To You
Seems I gotta need one girl
The Dying Head
I could love you better than I used to
When you're alone
Then there's screaming in the dark 
Mask of life, feelin' insane
There'll be no darkness tonight
Pick up and let them walked away
I'm still all alone
We're so gonna loose 
Throw your brother in jail
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Once You Get The Beat Inside Your Feet
With No Clothes On Their Back
And You Know Damn Well
Especially
Take me back where I belong
Where a restless soul is going
I Want You
Just one more step
The painful youth I've had
I am tired of this business
Things always missin'
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"
You're Just A Buffet, You're A Vegetable
It's Time That I Realize
And the prayer that frees the soul
To See It Through
I See The Kids In The Street,
Things look up just having you around
Or someone that you don't forget, no? 
We Must Live Each Day
You can't run away, past the said and done
A mother cries
We can't, we can't
(Rock me with your sweet caress)
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I just couldn't believe it
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
[Verse 3]
Die for it
If you're fixing to go
Keep daring to motivate
I never ran around
When I need just a smile
Now there’s a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
Climb The Highest Mountain
We both knew it wouldn't work
You Better Know Where
Every place I go everything I do
Have an answer now love don't hold me
Oh, everyday is a holiday
What's my life without you girl 
'cause you love me
Inside Of Me
Things I Say
This love will last though years may go
Dare Me
You Know What I Mean
Any Pearl
Preoccupied, she's afraid
In your mind you will find
You Got My Baby Cryin'
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
As he came into the window
Why Don't You Come With
She's headed for the big time, that means
I'm gonna answer your letter
You can cry on my shoulder
(Blood on my side)
Hee Hee!
Words like, "I love you."
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
You give them your all
Sit Us Down
Pull Over Boy And
Remember this
If You Care Enough
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Hurt the sheets
Keep doin' it
'Cause I'm Bothered Everyday
I'm Gonna Make A Change,
So did you come to me 
At That I Ran To The Phone
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
But I want you to be happy
And you’re running just to escape it
I don't wanna go away
Just sign your name on the line baby, I own you 
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
That Man, That Man, That
She put you under
[Rap - Vincent Price:]
And there's nothing I can see
Faces
So tell me is it crazy for you baby 
But instead of tendeness
Don't Try To Tell Me 
C'mon And Groove (Yeah) Let The Madness In The Music Get To You
But if ever things that have to be
[CHORUS OUT]
Through My Joy And My Sorrow
I Gave Her Promises
Teachers on strike, no more school today
What about children dying
Make
I'm gonna be in misery 
Don't Stop
Show You All The Passion Burning In My Heart
Ce que je ressens personne ne comprend
And Now I Wonder Why
Is that scary for you baby 
You got to...
Really Just A Waste Of Time
Ooh just a, just a, 
Gonna change the world, Ooo
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Mingle Mingle Jingle
Control of meHe really thought he really had
And I'll be there, yeah I will 
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
We're Takin' Over
I Feel Some Heat Is On
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
It's almost like dancing and romancing 
Got A Role For Me
Party now
Now it's coming down the stairs 
There's A Magic That Must Be Love
To Give It To You
Too much of that, fuse blown
And A Washed-Out Dream
On fera l'amour
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way
Ain't nothin' like a love desire (ooh)
Here come ol' flat top
You're just a liar
When you're not on top
You Need Some Lovin' (T.L.C.)
We'd Be Together
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near
That it's a thriller, thriller night
You Got The Time)
I've got to be free, baby!
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Everyone came to see
So Keep The Faith, Ow
We Cannot Feel
You Came And You Changed
And I'll Be Workin'
I'm Conditioned By
When it's all gonna end
The Hurt Came Back At Me
I'll always come home
Because
Makes It Makes It Right
I'd like to help you grow
When We Fell In Love
Some, some, some, some, day 
Though we're miles apart
Because of you, oh yeah
Walking the world together
To Your Alibis
This time around yeah...
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! (uh)
This Is Injustice
[VERSE 1]
The girl that now is dead
Or Do To Each Other
If I Can't Give Sweet Love To You
This Girl Was Persuasive
I Will Never Forget What We Had
Lie for it
For Those Who Have Prestige
It's very easy to say
(Never Shows She Cares) . . .
So Even If She's Asking You
So Get On The Floor
She Doesn't Kiss And Hug Me
She Left Me Standing Alone
(Man In The Mirror, Oh Yeah!)
Weary
There have been others
Can’t you see, I don’t wanna walk away
All off in Paris
Called that moon talk
Cause of all the blasphemy
Don't Say To Me
Go! Go! Go! Aaow!
[x2]
In the hood
And everything I own I give
Girl , this time...
I don't think so
"Why have you come from the West?
And Innocent Then
I feel I’m your blue
He got shit baby
What you're about
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
Don't You Wanna Know? My
Tonight
The moment I know she loves me 
I Wanna Rock With You
I Often Wonder If Lovin' You
To Each Other
'Cause Doctor John been here before
De santo no tengo nada
I'm so sad you're leaving
We'll be there to share each lonely road
And She Didn't Leave A Letter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Your business, is my business
You know it's thriller, thriller night
A Possibility Of More To Come
That's one word for heaven
Oh oh Hollywood just making it clearer
The midnite hour is close at hand
I'm Johnny Raven
It's not getting any stronger
I Know She's Mine
Am I scary for you baby 
I've been so cruel to you 
The mother-in-law
For her singing the tune
It's causin' confusion
[Michael] I Said Na Na Na Na Na
Someone touching your face
(Hoo Hoo!)
Don't Hide Our Love
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
I'll Pick You Up In My Car
So unaware of the lonelyness
I woke up yesterday
But too bad, too bad
This won't hurt you
And forever is meant for so very few
All through the night
And Frustrations
Trust in me
Living for one another
Won’t go, without her I’d go crazy
But together we can be alright (alright, yeah)
Like a knife in your soul
Gotta fever in your shoes
'Cause you might see me cry
You know you're scaring me too 
Will fade into the past
Things will go better if you just hold my hand (yeah)
Hello , good times
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
You Got Me Workin' Day And Night (I Don't Understand It)
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
(Give it to me)
I've got to be there so she knows 
But with your pen you torture men
Neglection can kill
And now you do regret it
We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
And The World We
Won't You Rock Across The Room
Now With Michael
Dangerous 
Yourself!
Everyone's Taking Control Of Me
And You Can Go By Feel
The wise old owl, the big black crow 
You tell me I'm wrong
Right)
It's Just Desire
Oh! Oh! Oh . . .Oh . . .
Relax
Knowing I was lost and passed away
You're Just Another Part Of Me . . 
Happy, that's you
Just to tell you once again
Oh girl, I really hurt you 
[Michael] I Said Na Na Na
You don't care
'Cause the power's deep inside my soul
And What You Doin' Right Now
Can't we set him free
The Final Message
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Get hard
Life's long hard climb
Surrounded by gloom
There Ain't No Way That Your Gonna
Got to be there 
Can’t we find some love to take this away
Don't understand it!
In four years catch me with a billon
He's got muddy water
To Me I'm Bothered
So D.J. Spin The Sounds
(He's Johnny Raven)
Then I will tell him
You know what I'm talkin' about
You're living much too fast
Harmonica in my hand I got soulful rhythm in me
You rocked my world (Oh...), you know you did
You're out of time
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same 
Loving You
They've gotta hear it from us
Your Hands
Life is an aggrovator,
Ah take me back
How did love slip away
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
We're so close
Wearing a smile, all of the while
She Love Me, She Love Me,
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Somebody's out to use me
No Matter What It's Gon' Take
Shot an arrow in me!
[fade out]
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
[Instrumental]
From love that I cannot hide
Avoiding ships of fools
You've got a place to go
You are there when the night's in town
He's takin' morphine
Chorus (Michael)
And Get Your Ticket Right
We Can Make It Right
(Speed demon)
Those abortion papers (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
You're not a man
Fight the circumstance,
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
I Played The Fool For You
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
It make me feel like... oooh!
Or more like the stars
That always bothers me
The fantasy you see is like a child again through rainbow colored eyes
A Touch, A Kiss
I need you now
Love, love, yea
Don't take your love 
It's you whose haunting me 
And all the prolems that I caused you
Don't you go no where
I Just Want To Touch You
I’m the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature
(Ooooh . . .)
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free 
When you find that you're always lonely
Uh, Uh, Uh
You think it's okay
You really got a hold on me, yeah
he’s keeping you down like a monster
Just enough to make your juices flow
Maria come on back to me girl 
Situation, segregation
What goes around comes around
With That Man In The Mirror
I'm So Proud To Say
Everywhere, you are there
Should you arrive and it's not there
But nobody came to her soon...
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,
Yet people push bullshit in my face
They don't care about the things you used to say
They Follow The Pattern Of
[Chorus (1)]
Don't be goin' down babe
So beat it, just beat it
You sit around and I watch your face
I had to work baby
How We Used To Talk
Together we can make it, all the way
Love today...
And Walk When Not Able
Oh no, can’t be without my baby
I told you that you sure looked good, now
I’m not a ghost from Hell, but I’ve got a spell on you
Each time my world seems like it's falling down 
Shameone
It's Only Gonna Happen Again
Maria I need you 
I'm Speedin' On The Midway
Must Come Together
Think of me when you see
(Need Me)
Any, any, anywhere you are
Billie Jean Is Always Talkin'
Shake Your Body Won't You G'on Get Down...
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
Girl, I know that this is love
Lift Up Your Mind
Someone's Always Doing Someone More
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
We don't need it...
Will Be Tonight
Somebody killed little Susie
Is the greatest show on earth
Black Jeans And
The law was on her side
If they had a friend like Ben 
Back
But I Hate Sleepin' Alone
I don’t know where we’re going
The way I talk
Girl I won't forget you, 
Look within your heart then ask,
Ain't Nobody's Business
Blood is on the dance floor
Baby yeah...
You've Known Me Long Enough
Into Plowshares
Saying That She's Yours Not Mine
So Give Yourself  A Chance
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
He wear no shoe shine
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself
I Like The Feelin' You're
You Know
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
She should have spied under his skin
You've got a friend, yes you do 
Sweet, like candy to a child
Yeah Shoo-hee
Just a little time is all it takes
I feel their envious looks at me
You'll remember a place
Someone tell me why
You're the one that I adore you
The Girl Is Mine (Mine, Mine, Mine)
In the morning, in the evening
He got feet down through his knees
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate
Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na,
She's doin' morphine
And I've Learned That Love Won't Wait
Dreams of golden glare
But nobody's sitting there
I Said My Baby's At Home
Be in two places at the same time
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
I wanna fall with you again
fortune or fame
(will you tell us, that you're OK)
When We First Met
And when you finally lose your tender touch
(The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me)
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
That makes it happen
Keep it goin'
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Just close your eyes and think of me 
They know my every do's
Will soon be found
You made your words sound so sweet
But there she lies shivering
Susie's got your number
And now she's out to get me
(he came into your apartment)
I'm gonna be 
by and by
You're throwin' stones
Just In Case
Somebody's lacking a hero
I am the moon light, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing
The world is out
The whole system sucks
(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)
Love that will endure
That Man, That Man, That Man
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night) Rock The Night Away 
I wanna touch you baby
Annie, are you OK?
Too bad, oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should
Of No Return
A nightmare, that’s the case
Across The Night-Time
(Go'on now)
'cause I can make it alright 'til the morning (hold my hand)
Speed Demon, You're The
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now
that girl I can't take her 
I broke my radiator,
And baby through the years even when we're old and gray
Suspended between time and space
I come running right over
I'm a killer nigga I ain't jokin'
From Wrong
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
Nobody ever showed her about us (oh, ba-da)
Then you left me all alone
Like a mirror reveals the truth 
So, Annie, are you OK?
the birds in the trees
You put a knife in my back,
It's too much
Biding your time
And A Day We'd Live As One
Some Other Guy Instead Of Me (Ooh)
I'll Never Let You Part
You're the one
Guide you to the light babe
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Say it's fair
The evil of the thriller
Then won't you slap my face..
Every single moment that we spend apart
Look at my face
(You are the lady in my life) Don't you go no where
But I am speechless, speechless 
Yeah, yeah
She's going Hollywood tonight
I am a friend through thick and thin
Yesterday when I felt down I start
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
You really got a hold on me,
She's working two jobs, keeping alive,
If he dies sympathize
Gonna Live Each Day And
Thar was waiting there
I wanna come home again
I Don't Wanna Hear It
I Like Lovin' This Way
Now why
The forest for the trees 
Me conoces bien
[7th Verse]
To Just
"Dear Michael, every time your record's on
Oh No, No No . . .
I Love The Way You Shake That Thing Girl
robbery suspect. The man was
I like the way how you're touchin' me
by and by (By and By)
What lifetime was I in? 
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Going town
We're here to simulate, eliminate
They started going steady and bless my soul 
No one's sleeping(no-one's lovin')
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
That's Why I'm Starting With
She Says There's No Turnin' Back
I Don't Know Whether To Live Or Die
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad
It was the sound of a crescendo
What Will I Do? Uh . . .Ooh . . .
She's So Dangerous
Take life easy, so easy nice and easy
'Stead Of Circumstance
Cause your God is such
Cause you're always there in my dreams
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
See The Nations Turn
And together we can make it all the way
You And For Me
You can cry, you can cry...
And after we all did?
You do it every time
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Monkey Business goin' down
I used to dream
Go underground young men...
You're One Of Us
(I Love You Too-I Want You
Got to give some love
(why did you take, why did you fake it)
Softly While You Sigh
And If I Stop . . .
With A Child's Heart
And I can't believe what's goin' round
‘Cause the pain gets stronger every day
'Cause There Ain't No Sin In Folks All Getting Loud
To show that he cares
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
Dreaming you're singing to me." 
(Rock me with your sweet caress) And I love you baby
Aaow
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around
(Keep on goin')
Y sabes tambien
You know the stranger is you
Think you said this feeling is your life
There Ain't Nobody There But Us
Would lie for you
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
He be waiting with his camera right on focus
She... I dah dah dah dah dah 
I try to find the truth
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
They'll take it like spit
We've Got Streetwalkers
What did these soldiers come here for?
I Need You Night And Day
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)
You know - you know - shameone
I've done all to be done 
(All is grand, all is bright)
You know Susie says its right
one man can claim
To show your stuff
It's Out Of My Hands
While I keep playin' the game
Doors
Tu me rends folle
And I did
Oh come on back to me girl 
For Such Reasons Unexplained
You Can Make It Happen
Did you have to go
Your Love So Complete
Hee, Gonna change the world, Ooo
Que nadie te querra
And how can I stop losing you
Ain't No Mountain That I
I Can't Help But See You
And I'll Smile And Say It Too,
That love is the answer to all that I am
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
Stay here and love me just a while
Maria don't you miss me just a little 
Ain't no good for me babe
Je sais que c'est toi
I'm Asking Him To Change
Too bad too bad about it
In the morning 
This Feeling's So Strong
You turned your back on a love and you can’t get it again.
Don't You
I didn't hold your hand
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)
It Ain't Too Much Stuff
Two different people
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine

There's a tappin in the floor
But that's what makes the world go round
2010 Thriller, there’s nothing iller, it’s killer
[CHORUS 3x]
Blood is on the knife 
Some day my happy arms will hold you
But as soon as love came
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man

[Michael & Paul]
There's Something I Would
(Want that dime)
(Life's long hard climb) 
Oh Maria you sweet little sunflower 
Then I will shake it
So Look The Truth
Thinking now that things won't be the same
Ben, most people would turn you away
You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Why his mother had to die
Share That Beat Of Love
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
If You Cared Enough
You just sit around just talkin' nothing
Tell me where were you
(Anywhere) 
If They Ask Her
In one blink I’ll disappear, and then I’ll come back to haunt you
This Wind Is Blowin' My Mind
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
So I've got to be there 
But all the while you hear the creature creepin'up behind
My heart cries out for your tuch
Someone is following you
Oooh, don't take your love from me 
Somebody's up, somebody's down
No grown-up thoughts
Just let God decide,
Baby, yes I do, yes I do
The government won't pay my taxes
Look what we've done
It Ain't Too Hard For Me 
I Love You Liberian Girl,
Now she started finger popping to the beat
You Can Call Me Honey

Your body starts to shiver
Get That Sound
I’d turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Your butt is mine
I Just Want You To

Then Make A Change)
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
It is just too much for me
Keep doing what you do
A heart attack baby
So I can see your face 
La guerre éclater
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
On a cloudy day

And I don’t know what I’d do, if I can’t be with you
[Carlos Santana:] Thank you, man!
It's all the same baby
(The way you give it to me)
Do What You Want To Do
Won't You Come, It's Emergency
Do it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
You're breaking the news!
Cause everyday at six
You Know It!
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight (oh, yeah)
Lipstick in hand
Je me sens si bien près de toi
'cause I been there before and you've been there before,
Free, free like the wind blow
Kicked in the face baby
(You'll be free, now)
Mine And My Baby's
If you want the one you love to touch
Through My Fear
Holy Mary Mercy me
And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Going know her way
Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go
Lift her with care,
That makes the lonely winter seem long
My mouth might let it be
[Bridge]
Still I Cry Alone At Night
But I Loved It
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
I ought to leave her alone 
If You Take The Chance And Do It
Fear Or Dread
Pretty Young Things, Repeat After Me
Someone in the dark for me!
Personne ne comprend
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
So take off the mask 
What Are We Doin'
All nations sing
On The Phone You And Me
But there's no-one sitting there
Catch me in a bad mood, flippin’ you’ll take a whippin’
Ven que te espera
Love Is A Woman
My joy had turned to pain
'Cause We're The Party People Night And Day
And I know that that's the truth
seems like you'd know by now 
You gave me strength
Into your arms I fell
Can't understand anyone having the blues
All the bad songs of the night
(Hee Hee!)
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
That lights up the sky
I never hit you when you're down
Will me, thrill me
By fighting love tonight, baby?
God forsake it 
And When You Think Of Trust
But after it all
That's with you baby
I'll Be The Freak You Can Taunt
(You Knock Me Off My Feet)
Our love is from the heart
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Don't give up our dreams
What do we get, she runs away
(Ooo, ooo)
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
I Hear Your Voice Now
Y sabas tambien
Hold me, hold me
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
It's Worth The Giving
Insurance?
A Summer's Disregard,
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Get Yourself Together
Maria it's been long so long 
I'm gonna have to put you down
'Cause The Will Has Brought
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
Love me baby
Predictions Fly Of Doom
'Cause we're almost all almost there
(Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
Her dress torn
I found my happiest days, 
(And There's The Choice That
Get Your Ticket Right
It was blood on the dance floor
I'm not satisfied baby
Just, Pull Over Boy
So do surrender
We've Got So Much Corruption
Hit The Lovin' Spot
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
Uh...
Talkin' 'bout my girl
That you give me strong hot fever
You are the sun in the Southern sky, when things are shaded
Don’t know where we’re going
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
He wanna eye ball
Then You Must Be Seein'
Take A Look At Yourself And
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
And spirits dancing 
If I had a penny for everytime
Don't You Ask Me
When I get close to you
Don't Want To Lay Down In A Bed Full Of Lies
I can't believe that is real
My Lonely Days Are Gone
And We'll Paint The Town
I said yeah
His eyes looked like mine
We've got a groovy thing
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme
Keep It In The Closet ...
Better Do It Now Before You Get To Old
But There's A Bigger Problem
Be careful what you say don’t overload
Do anything for news
Then, Won't You Taste It
I don't know 
No hay quien me de
They Eat Off Of You, You're A Vegetable
Midnight rider
Stop pressurin' me
I wanna spend, time to live in
And Ooh Won't You Take Me There
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Ooh My Sugar
Touch Me There
(Hee!)
You can never get me
Yeah, 
She lie there so tenderly
(Oh, no) 
Goodbye you today
What About, What About...
(I see you love me) 
(Always the lady in my life) You're my lady
He one holy roller
All your troubles to me
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)
Everybody do me
Feeling Passion And Lust
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
And Then It Happened
(My Baby Loves Me)
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
You write the words to destroy like it’s a weapon
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right
So I won't slack
My life will never be the same
To tinsel town
You Give Me Fever
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
There
Groove, Let The Madness In The Music Get To You
Now you better go and get yourself some attitude!
Baby it's all I need, it's all I need
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
Don't let it, let it, let it... 
'Bout Baby

Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
You Can Shout Out All You Want To
My Baby Cried
Mind!
A lonely heart 
Anything
Talkin', Squealin', Spyin'
Lay Back And Groove With Mine
I can't believe the things I see
But when you lend my mind
How many victims must there be
My girl
What good would Heaven be
Would die for you
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
She says I am the one
In the face
People Now
In My Heart
I wrote a letter, for the getto of the CIA, 
Singing a song, citing a Bible verse
I’ll be so proud if you let me love ya girl
Oh, girl please don't leave me
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Not not being alone
Word out shockin' all alone
That’s all I pray
What about rain
Reach out to a fantasy
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
You Got World Hunger
As the hounding media in hysteria
And Nothin' Gonna Stop Me
we get to crippin’, its running in the early morn’
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Keep movin' on higher ground
So come on, baby come on
Your love is magical, that's how I feel 
Of conquest and kings on the throne...
Girl, I need you sweet caress, oh
To see your fantasies
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
(Carry)
The force is love power
It's Too High To Get Over (Yeah, Yeah)
(Then You Close Your . . .
The government don't wanna see
Quiero estar junto a ti
I'll remember being with you

Who's Laughin' Baby?
Into The Night-Time
Ooooooh yeah babe, yeah babe
Today!
And I’m singing crying helplessly
At Your Call
Uuuuuuuuuuh
But like a two-edged sword
Breakdown
To one that fits the movie screen
You'll Only Be A Girlfriend Of Mine 
They'd do me for the money
Hour Like
Lady Can't You See That Heaven's Just Begun
My Feet)
In My Violence
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...yeah...ooh)
Now it's back to reality, for Ms. Hollywood
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
It's A Passion In My Soul
You better listen to me, yeah
If you could keep on,
'cause we've got forever
keep on dreaming there’s nowhere to run
Keep The Faith, Baby, Yea
And I'll be there, yes I will 
Je ferme les yeux
This Is The Mission
Music, music and me
You get sentimental, and
Come to me, let me be your one and only (one and only)
You really wanna get me
Or Is It Just A Lie
It's dead and stuffy in the place
Hey I ought to leave 
'Cause There's A Chance For Choices
You Have To Soothe It
So I could blow'em open
Got to be there in the morning 
Somebody's Broken Heart
Money.
Girl don't take your love from me 
You're Everything This World Could Be
Need to feel your hand
The ghost of jealousy
You Got To Groove Just Like You Know You Should
I Like The Groove Of
I used to say "I" and "me"
Are you ready for a real good time
Hot In The Face
And maybe next year
(They just couldn't take it) 
We'd Live A Life Anew
(She's)
I Really Want It
Show Him How You Feel Inside
My friend, my someone in the dark was you
But Her Inner Spirit And Words
(Still You Said Goodbye)
I Fell Trapped Into Her
Home with their fathers,
[Michael]
Twisting her soul
I Love You So
We've Got Drug Addiction

Who have the grateful?
He's one of us baby
Mamita, te tengo la came
(Heal Me And Bathe Me)
A Matter Of Time
(Softly You Say To Me)
Take And Deceive Me
In The Jungle
And you still deal with the fires 
She'll never know la da da dum 
Don't leave me girl 
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
I can't quit now
just to get in
Why You Wanna Trip On Me
You'd do her for the money
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on
Just Keep Your Eyes On The Prize
If I started now in the deep
Painting the 
Your my lady and I love your girl
Everything will be alright, he assures her
She's looking for the hope in the empty promises
(Softly Then Boldly)
Noche de estrellas
So don't you ever complain
No broken bridges
From Their Suspicions
Kill for it
A stranger who'd be my friend
Rock You Into Day (Sunlight)
Free and untamed that's how I've grown
To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
And It's Comin' After You
(I wanna be free)
I need us to carry on
She Likes The Way I Stare
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
What about elephants
To close Susie's eyes...
It was all for God's sake
(You've got a friend in me) 
En mi corazon
Before Your Mind Gets Blown
Eat Yo', Get Yo', Hoo! Aaow!
That's how you make me feel 
By listening to me, myself
All they say, I do
It's slander
And after be your friend
I'm going down baby
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries
Mike's bad, I'm bad
Talk To Me Baby
But with proof as sweet as you, noo
You Got To Be Startin' Somethin'
dah dah dah dah dah, you 
I just wanna touch you
[Chorus x3]
Don't you let go baby
J'ai oublié tout ton passé
Just Good Friends . . .
Lust Can Blind
Girl, i think i love you
Dead or alive
Girl, I Need To Hold You
I hope to make a change now for the better
(You are the lady in my life) Woo
Spark My Nature
Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
the bees envy me
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand 
Is the greatest show on earth (yea e yea)
[P.Y.T.'S] Na Na Na Na
'Cause We Got So Far To Go
We're destined to screw ourselves one blow
We've Got More Problems
Cinderella, when you smile
But this time around I'm taking no s...
When We First Met Girl
And nothing really matter
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
If you just smile...
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
In My Deepest Despair
Shoot the breeze
Come on, come on,
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Alright
To get a message across, that yet you haven’t heard
When someone in the dark reaches out for you
He come groovin' up slowly
Have you seen my Childhood?
Got to reach that driver
What can I say to make you stay 
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it 
With rain and with sunshine
Love Is The Answer
Where did we go wrong
Hear the beating of his heart
Is midnight is so near
I've Seen Her Look Better
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
(Say We're Just Good Friends)
Now you're wearing a badge
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
Movin' Up A Hand
Don't Let It Get In Your Way
You can be sure of one thing, that’s fate
(Won't you write me back, please write me back)

Alone?
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
Still They Hate You, You're A Vegetable
Every Musician's Fan After
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
But it’s been so long now all I do is cry
Heaven Is The Prize
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And she answered "No" to me but
You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl
[Verse 3:]
For You And For Me
You sit behind the mask
And you save my faith off the ground
(I'm So Tired Tired Now)
It tells you never be afraid
life)
Love Is Strong
And whosoever shall be found
You Got To Not Let Yourself . . .
Just give yourself a chance,
you are not alone
So don't you monkey shy with me
What have we done to the world
Close your eyes and count to ten
If They Say -
Where your blood comes from
Though we're far apart
You Really Turn Me On
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you’ve never know
Though It's Plain To See
When will this mystery unfold
But no one can find thee
You and me, makin’ love all the way through another night
(You rocked my world)
It's so good too 
She Trapped Me In Her Heart
That didn't make it
And to me that's really true
I like the way how you're holdin' me
And you're the only one that could take me this far
But The Power That Love Has To Make It Right
No hay felicidad
Anything for money
But Who Is Sorry Now
Everybody litigation
All the news today, they say we're crazy (celebrity)
[Ad-Lib To Fade]
But I say it's just
A Major Love
Her schemes and plans
Now I'm just wondering why you think 
Oh.. it always ends up this way
So tell me am I scary for you baby 
In Ecstasy
That glows in my heart
Brothers they don't give a damn
I hear you walking
Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I Do
Only God could decide
Tell Him (Woo Hoo)
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Did She Find In Someone Else?
They’re watching you fall
[CHORUS 1]
Con tu pasion
And the lonely cry fades in the air
With You? 
Foolish of me, I couldn't see 
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
I Said You Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
I would tell them bring me back to her
Now it's my job to get revenge
'cause you came in time,
'Cause They Got Nowhere
How many people have to cry
Ben, you're always running here and there
So Tonight Gotta Leave That Nine To Five Upon The Shelf
That There Are Some With No
You know I'm bad - you know
I'm giving you
This message to deep to ignore
I love you madly
(Fill you with the sweetest love)
Were Laughing At Me In Town
[Rebbie (spoken)]
So tell me what we're waiting for? (hold my hand)
Now he's left to explain
Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Has Come Of Age
Sunset Driver
You stripped me of my dreams
Hurry, hurry mister postman, take my letter, tell her i love her
Darlin', Let Me Hold You
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby
But first I need your hand
Yeah, ooh
She Waits At Backstage
This particular monster can read minds
Their mistaken jealousy (oh?)
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax
(Choose you babe) 
Your Own
Gonna stay
I always gave you good thing
I don't understand it
People say I'm strange that way
I'll Change The Rules For You
No, Baby
That I'm learning a thing or two
Is reach for the truth
Who will live and who will die?
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
The Girl Was Persuasive
Don't you do it
Just Open The Door
Even sell my soul to the devil
To Try To Stop This
You really got a hold on me, come on
If you can't answer
That You Seduce Every Man
The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine
Maria 'cause honest girl you were the only one 
Oooh, you are there, 
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
All I wanna say is that
Love was taken from a young life
Of the truth in chapters of our minds
Just to tell you once again,
When I'm Not Around
You can never trash me
Go On! Hee! Hee! Aaow!
People say I'm not okay
And if you wanna to see 
Wonder this time where she's gone 
[Spoken Intro:]
But She Never Shows
[3rd Verse (Paul)]
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
He got flat baby
I Am The Dead
Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
She will say I was the man that got away 
Straighten Out Your Life
Farewell my summer love, farewell
They thought they really had control of me
I’m the floor when you fall, and when you scream it’s ‘cause of me
Ever do what you do for me
In the glow of candlelight
Your every lick baby
Love you so much it's not funny
They Follow Each Other On
You're doin' it
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
And I just can't take it
Ooooooh
You are not alone
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind
I Know That You Can Sail Across The Water
Always to please daddy
Susie likes to agitate
I'm gonna have to put you down Yeah
But I Learned Too Late
Gonna Dance Gonna Burn This Disco Out
Before we learn to live as brothers
C'mon, Girl, C'mon Girl
All You Need Is The Will To Want It
Some Things In Life
Baby baby, don't give up
Baby don't make me
Into the truth
And heartache pain
Am I scary for you oh
Ain’t the pictures enough, why do you go through so much
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
So don't you start no stuff with me
And everything I own I give (I want you, girl)
Keep It In The Closet
Shalalala boom boom
Please leave us alone
Who left my heart in pieces
When You Have To Say
Every soldier dies in his glory
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter
Looking Out
Heal the world we live in, save it for our children
In my search to find myself
He dares to be recognized
Don't make a fight
Who's Laughing Baby-Don't
On count of three
And It Doesn't Seem Right
Live Your Life Off The Wall (Live It Off The Wall)
Whatever happens, just don't let go of, my hand.
All you need is love,
Your Mouth Is So Sweet
This Time I'm Trying Not To Go Too Far, Cause
And Tell Me Twice
I found heartache instead
I Touch Her Shoulder
I'd change for you like that
You Know That You Came
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here.
Gonna to fit

Because 
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Gotta Have It My Way
A world of sweet harmony
To make my mother smile
But nobody sitting there 
Say Girl I Need You
(Just Good Friends)
Think about life, I’d like to have my child
You Got To . . .
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
But remember sister or brother
This time around you're making me sick
Sayin' Baby I'm Alright
Ain't no love in this world
You're my life
Keep on with the force don't stop (keep on now)
Each Other
The girl won't break it
I'm telling you
What about the common man
"Ronny, you're so silly."
As Long As We Believe In Love
I hate your kind baby
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?
Music and me
Can you dig it? 
Father's confused, mother despair
Slander
You are the angel glow that lights a star
See, it's not about races
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
That We'd Live Our Life As One
He one Mojo filter
I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)
And soon childhood ends
Gonna Groove Gonna Move Ya
Tschada dada dada daa (Hold on, Hold on)
(Can't afford to waste it) 
No One Can Hurt You Now
You just sit around just talking about it
(Feel you with the sweetest love) Let me be your baby
Sounding heartbeats intimidations
You soul survivor
Is destined for history
Girl don't take your love 
To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
As I, Turn Up The Collar On My
Cos when he's in your arms
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu'
Now The Weekend's Come It's Time For Fun
Don't get mean
Tell me what's goin' down babe
Who's Doin' Me By
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
(Yeah!-Make That Change!)
Their lunacy shade
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Diana!
Love you
She wipes her tears away.
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
Masquerade the heart 
Tell Him What He Needs To Know
She's so true, oh yeah
Stay awhile, oh
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)
And you don't have to read it, read it
This is the end of your life
In love for an instant
You Got To KnowWhen It's Good To Go
And Hug Me
Keep on with the force don't stop (keep on with the power)
(Man In The Mirror-Oh
And We Can Share This Ecstasy
Oh the blood in her hair...
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Baby, don't take your love from me 
He’s dragging you down like a monster
And you're fighting the wars
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground 
My world
Why did you let him get away?
For Now We'll Make A Vow
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
I'll stand not well apart
broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I’m kidding
I Want To Love You (P.Y.T.)
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
A treasure time won't steal away
in her painted on jeans
Jam
You are there
yeah yeah, all the things you are, are mine
Come on take me please
When this old world gets you down 
Sometimes I part it up,
There Was A Time I Used To
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
[Verse 1:]
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
(now baby, oh)
It's Gonna Feel Real Good,
Strange Inhumanity
An' How Love Could Not Be Denied (Oh No)
So Come Together
Though you really wanna fix me
Even the flowers and lollipops
If I was dead broke and smokin'
If you don't stop
Love is as welcome
Givin' Me
Power (ah power) is the force the vow
Give In To The Fire
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
And yet we're not too young to know
I am here to stay
And you discuss your trip
Light up your face with gladness
And there's no peace inside (inside) (hold my hand, oh, yeah).
I need my privacy, I need my privacy
She hides from the color
You're my lady
Not Dangerous
Morning glow is almost here
I'd like to take sometime and get away, then they'll say,
I won't be complanin' (no no)
And shivers in fright
He don't do half what he say
Loving me bring me game
They're All In Line
It's not about love and romance
I wish that love would come today!
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
World A Better Place)
Situation, aggravation
And leave one family oh...
And It's You I'm Choosin'
You're called the "Just Few"
Me
Is Fakin' 'Cause
And causes her mournful cry
Love can turn your mind around like ferris wheels and spinning carosels
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I Can't Deny
Someone in the dark for me
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
Then, If You Want It
Fading In The Twinkling Of An Eye
This time around I'll never get bit
this the bomb, ring the alarm
Will Always Be Dear To Me
that you can get to me with anything 
You Best Just Leave Them Alone
Sans toi c'est un enfer
Because the force,
Gonna Feel Real Good Now!
Notre amour brillera dans ce monde
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
I never thought she'd leave me here forever
I don't like you but I love you
And I am so sad and lonely
And Susie ain't your friend
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme
You're takin' morphine
Girl, Close Your Eyes
Stab me in the back
[L. T. B. rap performance]
Would Have Mercy On Me
To take my time wherever I go
Keep on with the force don't stop (yeah)
Everybody's gone mad
Will You Still Care?
(what you do to me)
You Can Call Me Honey 
Keep the brother on his knees
We're talkin' danger, baby
But who can stand when she's in demand
[Chorus x 2]
Gon' Keep It Sister
Don’t let go, I don’t wanna walk away
Who will dance on the floor in the round
Night creatures call
And you my friend will see
Go With It
Da da da da da la da dum 
You know we'll never part
'Cause I just can't take it
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there
You are a liar
And Fight Till The End
And Hold You
No She Acts Like I'm
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
And call my name out loud 
I will love you more each day
What you're willing do
Tu amor aparece
Life's about a dream
I love you, I love you
Go For What You Want
(Here and there) 
Cause we're almost there
No one understands me
So he can do or else
A hot kiss honey
To Think For Two Years She Was Here
No matter what, you just want to feel it again
It's just a part of it 
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
And together we'll fly
(And You Know You Must
There's nothing wrong
Between a million bucks and you
Your Love's Got Me High
You And Me In Spain
In the middle of a village
Could It Be Really Me,
So unreliable
Keep on reachin, do it for me
To face whatever falls my way
Here I am so all alone
How good to be happy and free
To Cry
Holy Mary mercy me
Gonna Make A Difference
To fly away just like a sparrow (Oh, my, my)
Come On!...
Everywhere you are
Not set, the pace for style
And she was the dancer
[Ad Libs Out]
Right till the end, for you 
Somethin' About You Baby
Will I Do
You're the answer to the prayers I say, 
So There's Really No Time
I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Returning on beams of light
You are disgustin' me
What about death again
[Chant:]
Life Ain't So Bad At All If You Live It Off The Wall
Just when you thought he was done
And the whole world has to answer right now
(It's Johnny Raven)
That you send along, signed with all your love 
Don't You Come Walkin'-
And I told about equality
He brushed himself off
Problem Here
Hold Me, Only You And I Can Make Sweet Love This Way
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you’ve got me nervous yet
Are you OK Annie?
But it's just like my girl 
The Wind, Ya' See
The years go by swiftly
Scared of the moon
me, baby, yeah)
Monster (yea-eah)
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
I'd Rather Leave The Fantasy Of What Might Be
Without You
You don't believe me then
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh
Nation To Nation
You're my princess
Who Am I, To Be Blind?
I Wanna Groove With You
His place in world history
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
'Cause It's Dangerous
Go On Girl!
And Let The Truth Unfurl
It's no dreams
He wanna shake it up shake it down
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
I like the way you move it 
This girl lived in vain
No...
All The World
By Saying Let It Be
[VERSE 3]
Home alone
You should have told her (should have told her)
And you know there's music to my ears
With Two Lovers In A Scene
What about the seas
Smooth Criminal
I Hear Harps,
Si tu te vas
(hee hee hee)
You'll probably never get this letter
Now, Now
So Get On The Floor And Dance With Me 
And it's floating through the room
Is out to kill
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And again, and again, and again...
Stars Shine
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
I'm gonna be
dah dah dah dah dah 
A monster that you can see disappear
And No Message Could Have
Make my heart keep turn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Another nest to try
Want your pot of gold
This Will Be A Love Lasting For All Time
You all have to answer to the one u above
Everybody knows my name
Why you stab me in the back?
For we sing tomorrow's song
It may seem strange I know
If I don't come up, number one
We'd Live A Love So True
Because we love, I know
And It Doesn't Seen Right
A Whisper Of Love
What about all I saw?
Tell me things they all believe, I do
(Speed Demon)
Anywhere You Wanna Go
Dangerous
In the everlasting light that shines
I heard just what you said
Don't Let 'Em Get In Your Way
[Repeat Chorus - Ad-Lib/Fade-Out]
Eternal (ah eternal) love shines in my eyes (ooh)
Uh, oh,...
Too young to really be in love
Maria why d'you keep a-running away 
Will I Do 
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
[KGB interrogator (Russian to English translation):]
And Girl No Matter What Was Said
From word of mouth you're breaking every law
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Through Our Doubts
Love, Love, Love,Love
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
Can't Let Go
Come into the light
You Know-I've Got To Get
Your Heart
I ain't playing
His father grabs his hand
You'll seeeee...
Go on, babe
Root-Do-Do-Do . . .
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'
She Likes The Boys In The
Truth be told the grassy knoll
We've ruined what's pure down from nature below? 
Ouuh, you are there, 
A burning deep down inside
(My girl)
Straighten Out Yourself
Just sit around just talking nothing about it
A revelation
(hee)
Then won't slap my face
And Just Enjoy Yourself
Got Pitts by the door
Come On!
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
[2nd Verse (Paul)]
(Doot-Do-Do-Doo . . .)
He comes to give it again
(Too bad)
(why are you stalking me)
The Planets Are Linin' Up
If you just smile
After the staring, what did you say?
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
You Are My Friend
The song of pain and grief across the land
He's got monkey finger
Are closing in to seal your doom
Got to get your love
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
We never say, "I don't need you"
Do or dare
Fought in a battle, where nobody won
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
I'm a dancin man yeah
Then Make A Change
Streetwalking baby
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
You Really Can't Make Him Hate Her
Means Never Givin' Up On Love
You are there somewhere
Go on, baby
Stray I will
With each passing day
I lost my heart
(You Knock Me Off Of
You Wont Be Laughing Girl
(I wrote ya) 
Of all faith looking new
Shoo-hee
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Woo! Woo! Woo!
Maria hey hey Maria 
Thinkin' that they got it made
You feel I’m real
The world's a better place
"All the injustice"
How great to give love without invitation
Do it do it Let's do it do it
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
How It All Began
[Verse 4]
Be my girl
In the light 
you can drive but you done
Your brother didn't make a nickel
Gone One Night
I like the way how you're kissin' me,
But girl, you know it's true
Every time your lady speaks she speaks of me, threatened
There's Something
Turns your dreams around
Cause your body's talking to me
No matter what, you just want to read it again
We should have started long ago
You hate your race baby
So We Can Rock Forever, On
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Never knew we could be so strong
Did he say to either do it or die?
[ROD SERLING VERSE]
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
Pretending That They're Not
All the lies you have to say I do
Either you're wrong or you're right
Then watch the ones
I Just Lit A Rocket
It was cloudy before but now it's clear
Gonna lock you up
Is That What She Said
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
I want you to remember
But if you wanna be, yeah
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Get On It
Now Who Is Sorry Now
on, what they gave me as my tools,
And Thoughts
Love Me Forevermore
Na Nah)
Laying all my troubles down
On the carousel
I won't be complanin' (ooh ooh)
She said that I don't care
Just Pull Over Boy
We're sharing light brighter than the sun
The time might come around when you’d be moving on
[Chorus 2:]
P-I-T is B-A-D
And my heart sings along 
What a victorious thrill
Good Friends . . .
People laugh when they're feelin sad
Police after being wrongly identified as a
Your night is free what you wanna be
Let me fill you with my dreams
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
And girl you know that I'll be there
I Love The Way You Shake Your Thing
If you want the one you love
I was excited about the way that things could have been
Ma Ma Sa, Ma Ma Coo Sa
You're just preaching the Bible and they still speakin you're a lier 
Dog gone
What would you do?
You might see me cry
Don't be bothered they said
Feel The Heat Feel The Beat Rock You Into Day (Sunlight)
Keep on with the force don't stop (oh my baby)
So Baby, Be Mine
Better Stand Up And Act Like You Wanna Do Right
You stayed my side
Give It Baby
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
But we took our chances
Heaven must be wary 
Smiles coming through my tears
I Said But Unlock The Door,
What about forest trails
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie
That you said was yours and mine...
Yes, She Said It, You Keep Dreaming
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Living a Christian soul
My star secret friend and me
My name is Dapper Dan
It Just Seemed Like Heaven
You'll Only Be A Girlfriend Of Mine
[2nd Verse]
I Don't Understand The Way You Think
I can't take it much longer
Gotta Straighten Up Your Act And Boogie Down
Tell Him What You Do To Me
Why did you let him get her?
But you are not alone
We're Mean Is You
He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
Work On It Brother And You'll Make It Someday
She's Got Just What It Takes
Baby, don't leave me 
Because Your Words 
Yes . . .Just Good Friends
Or let it be...
He really thought
Je supporterai tout
Wishing them well, and wishing them home
You Really Give It Too Me
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
She Came At Me In Sections
Dance Across The Floor
Brother's in curse
He wanna write my obituary
Deep in the night
He out shock in every single way
Como a ella yo
I Don't Want It
Take my hand, don't let go, baby, hold me (hold me)
Es mi vida y
Walking The Line
I was wondering, you know
And The Chance Is Choosin'
Come on back
Does he send letters to the FBI?
And it seemed that everything was on my side
Who Said The Future's In
Waitin' For You
He's got walrus gum-boot
Todo mi amor
To Five
Smile and maybe tomorrow
The City Winks A Sleepless Eye
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
Fashioned so slenderly
When you're down and trubled 
Rock With You, Rock With You Girl (Yeah)
I Don't Care Anyway
On how I feel
Today he's taking twice as much
It doesn't matter how you're holdin' me
I'll make you see
Not There
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'
So Tonight Gotta Leave That Nine To Five Upon The Shelf 
When Lost Will You Find Me?
He wanna time bar
Hide every trace of sadness
Girl you're so together
(Why don't you give me some time)
Joyful Giving
Like it was written in the stars I knew
All of those faces
[4th Verse]
Give me your wings so we can fly!
There Is No Danger
You sue her for the money
[Pitbull:]
People make the world go round...
You can ask my brother
The Wind Ya' Know
Torn apart by creed
(Hoo!)
(will you tell us that you're OK)
Without the soul for getting down
You Got Me Workin' Workin' Day And Night
Cheek To Cheek
Do You    Remember The Time
Now I believe in miracles
Let me love ya for a little while
I didn't understand
Float around
Not from the prizm, take charge like manilla
He's got Ono sideboard
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
She's Probably Worried
My name is Dapper Dan 
Am I scary for you 
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
To Touch A Stranger
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...
(Proud)
(You can cry on my shoulder) 
All alone wishing on stars
Sunny days seem far away
Catch a chicken with a P-Y-T
Apology shallow like the ocean
Gotta, The Peace Of Mind No
I guess you'll say
Tell 'Em That We're Just
I'm Gonna Show Your Boyfriend (Yeah)
Because I’m keeping a place
And The Reason Why She Left Me
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
Like The Loss Of Sunlight
Dancin'-Hee!
Will I be the guy that you put down
(Hold On)
Oh!
I know, know, know, know, know, 
Is He Getting Nearer
Is if there was a girl at all
Is the height of haunting souls 
(Close the door)
I Told My Brother
Why don't you scream and shout it
[Michael Jackson:] Thank you, Carlos!
Girl!
(Change His Ways-Ooh!)
As a sunny sunny day
Ah, On The Floor And Dance
We may not change the world in one day
Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear."
Read the Holy word
I'm sure they'd think again
I Am The Thing That You Need
To lead our hearts astray
Look at me
All Is Going My Way
Respect to believe in your dreams
It's Worth A Try
Don't You Come Walkin'
Paul, I Think I Told You, I'm A Lover Not A Fighter
I'll come a-runnin' 
Such false witnesses
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start
(So hold)
Can't You See . . .?
Can I get how it feels baby
To Go
The task may seem
Shameone, lay on me
Know
Gone Too Soon
A life time, love so guarantee (guarantee)
You're dirty
What about animals
When things will hurt you
Talk On The Phone
It's the price of fame
All The Things We Said Like
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
When you speak the angels all sing
Are you OK, Annie?
Don't you ever make no mistake 
And I can't believe that I can´t tell her no 
Ghosts be hiding everywhere 
Keep dirty
I'm in 
My father always told me,
We'll make it through
Father left home, poor mother died
If you go, I won’t forget you girl
And Never Did I Ask You Questions Why
Oh happy day
'Cause I love such elementary things,
You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did,
You Got Gang Violence
Of You
Sure Appreciate
Where do your loyalties lie?
I had were cold
I reached for the sky
Let tomorrow be your friend
Hee! Hee! Hee! Hoo! Hoo!
Take Away My Money
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
(Starting With Me!)
This is like a fairytale with you
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was 
And how many children must we see
I Know The Girl
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside 
And wishing them home
Know Me At All
(Just Good Friends . . .)
Tout te donner
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh
There you are, I walk alone
Everybody sing...
I Like Livin' This Way
I know it's you honey baby, yeah
We're as close as two friends can be
Told me that you're doin' wrong
And together we can make it all the way, yeah
Well I guess you'll say
Who will live and who will die
It’s just the things I do
Got to be there where love begins 
My cup over runneth with the fullness and grace
After you made me all your own
(Mind)
They could print it around the world today
(Lay back in my tenderness) Stay with me
You Cannot Waste It
(Keep the brother on his knees)
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
'Cause this is love power (ooh)
You can find them when the letter’s bout to fall
If You Make Me A Star
[Chorus x2]
Heaven can wait
Oh yeah
I've got a sweeter song than
Someone's Always Tryin' To Start My Baby Cryin'
But Ya Got Ta Keep The Faith
So unrelying
This Time Is Forever
And when I come to you 
And pins the child lying there
Dah! Chika-Chika-Chika-Ah!
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
OK, I want everybody to clear the area right now!
To Know That I Don't Play
Promise Baby, You'll Love Me
West bound Greyhound
Cinderella, do not go
Ma Ma Se, Ma Ma Sa,
They wanna see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson
With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream
Sister confused, she went alone
Can't Climb Baby
We'll never part,
To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood
Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout
He one spinal cracker
But it's just that I love you
(Don't regret, girl) 
(Lead Me)
I don't need no money, 
It's all absurd
Yeah, even your darkest night 
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
Like a child who's got no home 
Deep in my soul baby
Cannot Lie
And I'm a better man
Make me wanna scream
Within my heart, oh yeah
And nothing gonna stop
Of Her Presence
Life Like You're The Law
Maybe you and I can't do great things
With such collusions don't it make you wanna scream
Hold Me
Just because you're there
But What Is Love Girl
'Cause Al Capone said it
[50 Cent]
Then forever can begin
(Ya Know)
There's a creak behind the door
Don't Come Beggin'
Then I will take it
Need the Midas touch
What you are for me I'll be for you
Now Baby
And you'll give me a chance 
I'll Never Let You Go
We're Bringin' Brighter Days
Cambiaremos al mundo manana
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
[Chorus x2:]
Cinderella, stay awhile
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
...Gon' Keep It Brother
(Fairytales, make-believe and you) 
And A One Man's Soul
Hey, what about yesterday
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
You tried everything, you never thought of before
I start to give it up,
Swift and sudden fall from grace
should have known she was a heartbreaker 
If you give me a hand
(No, You Won't See Her Kiss
Because you lost his love
I'm gonna take you higher
I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable 
(Wooh) (Wooh)
This Is Our Planet
When she says hello to the world 
My every thought is you
I am the one who said that you are free
Tonight’s story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
My Back
[Rap: Shaquille O'Neal]
She Called My House
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
[2nd verse]
I would never know the reason why
(Carry Me There)
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
How could this be
I'm in my (day, alright)
Let's make this a night we won't forget
From one more violent crime
You're my only
Everyone they don't know me
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion 
I just want you here with me Maria 
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
Yeah Yeah! Yeah Yeah!
I know your game
Juste one more step
Will You Come And Take Me
Your just a dog gone!
And some day I'll know that moment divine
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
Like a child so gay and so carefree
Ain't no stop and go
I like the way how you're kissin' me
Maria don't you need me just a little 
Just Hold Me Baby And I'm
(I'll take my time, baby)
She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay,
So she ran into the bedroom
Or let it be
The Way You Make Me Feel
You're Just Another Part Of Me
There Are People Dying
(Naku Penda Piya-Naku Taka
(I love ya) 
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
(Of without compromise, 
You're sellin' out souls but
I'll give you my heart
Don’t you don’t you like it
Though you really wanna get me
If you can, if you can find it
A Better Place
Tomorrow
What about Abraham
I’m the one watching you
There's A Steam Beat
Let sadness see what Happy does
Did you ever stop to notice
Like we did, when we first met
You rocked my world, you know you did (Oh)
What do you want from me?
And they eat your soul like a vegetable
I'll Give You All That I've Got
Some Things Take
Shot me down as cold as ice
My Baby Loves Me
A smooth criminal)
Then you will dare it
Mine And My Baby
Stay awhile
J'aimerais prononcer que toi, que toi
Got rid of the rocks
See That Girl
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
What about all their joy
Tu voz me acaricia
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine
Got to be there
Always give up some more
I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (hold my hand)
Will You Show To Me
Since the day I've been loving you
All thru the night I'll save you from the terrors on the screen,
You're paralyzed
I Love You Baby
Dirty, dirty baby
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
I started talking
Is like the month of may, yeah
Will It Get Inside
You won't live a quiet life
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Her world is crumblin'
I ain't scared of no sheets
A Widow Deeply Scarred,
She wrote "Dear Michael
Stop *?!@#!in' with me
And ain't nothing changed
And I'm So Glad I Found You Girl
But We Both Cannot Have Her
I've never known...
(she wanna be a star)
"I Love You, Liberian Girl"
Keep on with the force don't stop (keep on baby)
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
This happened much too soon
'Cause There's A Chance For Chances
And the whole world has to
You're like the cinema
(We're almost there) 
My Life Ain't Worth Living
Morning glow all of your life
You Look So Beautiful Tonight
Who Don't Wanna Teach
Who's bad...
Peek in the shadow
You so desire
A Fool Who Lives Alone
Don't make it factual, actual
she's a heartbreaker 
Give me a treason 'cause
No Need For Rejection
Is it scary for you baby
All the things I wanna say and
She got your number
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
J'ai besoin de rêver
Comes around, comes around, comes around
She Knows When They Come To Town
Now our separate ways we go
Just Say It And I'll Do
Oh it will
Set me free
Like a rainbow after rain
My heart's getting weak
What about flowering fields
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
'Cause you really can't control me
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
You say it's not a sword
You know, you know, you know - come on
It Seems You Get Your Kicks From Hurting Me
She was there screaming
I ain't scared of your brother
The unknown monster is about to embark
It’s the day, a brand new day, let’s both go outside and play
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
In Her Pocket
I Never Knew But I Was
Because I Forgot The Key,
If you just...
Oh, no
[6th Verse]
Come To The Place
Don't make a fight,
She Said He's Not Coming
Their's a ghostly smell around 
Never Neverland, that’s the place
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
All you have to do is call 
Erase the past
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
Late At Night When The Wind Is Free
You Can't Neglect It
A knock-out queen
Feels like a fire
Maria don't you hear me calling Maria 
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
(This paper) (Hee-Hee)
Tell me what will I do
I’m underneath
They've gotta hear it from me
Oooh!
You've got a friend in me
Are you infected with the same disease
Your Talk, Your Dress
Ooh, girl, you're so together
Love Me Like A Mother
Why, 'lone
All Day Long
Baby for you'se
If You Can Get It
The way I walk
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever
[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]
Her dreams are tumblin' 
Monkey business goin' down
I'll fell breaking 
Fever, temperature's risin' now
Make A Little Space
And a miracle has happened tonight
Nobody ever showed her about us
Da da da da da da da dum 
Every Year, yours are good
You feel that she's the tease
She Always Takes It With A Heart Of Stone
And how many struggles must there be
Just beat it, beat it
Euphoria, Euphoria, Euphoria,Euphoria
Make me fly away...
Please don't close the door to our future
Roots I'll never own
For all the lost children
To know that woman
You are the promised kiss of springtime
He begins to blow 
[2x]
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams
Are you ready for a real good treat
Blood is on the knife
You gonna send your baby straight to me
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
We both found what we were looking for
Or see it on the TV screen
[Janet]
I am your joy, your best of joy
Hey, don't regret girl, 
With The Eyes Of Desire
I got song you enchanted me
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry 
Suddenly the sun shines for a while 
Not to be with you 
The Curtain Comes Down
After Dark..., Do You, Do You, Do You
Everywhere you seem to turn
(The Way You Make Me Feel)
With the words you use
You go through life making fools of others
On my own, I was lonely
(You are the lady in my life)
Bum Rushed The Door
But she doesn't hear a word that he say
There we are as cold as ice
I love you
Over me
What about all the dreams
Todo mi amor eres tu ...
Hot Damn
Sugar Fly With Me
Hit me, kick me
To feel letting my hair blow
She's going Hollywood
Living is all I see
Is that boy still alive? (uh)
Have time to come true
I've moved and make you cry
Keep your head up!
Is It Something I Said
We Can Sing Songs Of
Because now it's onto me
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Don't let go of my hand
And I know my nigga Mike like that
I let you fall into me
Hey hey hey
To Stop That Child From Cryin'
Well, like a woman that's pregnant for ten months
From Miles Around
Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalalalala
Still crying, tell me what should I do.
So I said lets get right on the floor
(There is nothing in your eyes)
I've got sunshine
Before Your Confidence Will Win Out
Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed
You know I really do hate to say it
You say you love me but it's hard to see
(so, Annie, are you OK?)
(Is It Just A Lie)
Put all your trust in me
I am forever, I am forever.
And though you fight to stay alive
You can sing your melody
And The Entire Human Race
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)
And Eat Your Ticket
Oh oh morning glow
She tried to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
Band
You see I never met a girl 
There's a ghoul upon the bed
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)
Before your eyes 
Push it in stick it out
No Message Could Have
(Janet)
[Michael Jackson]
Who Promise
Beat me, bash me
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
She's blonde and she's bisexual
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
She says
When she says, "Hello world!" 
But summer's gotten away from us
Shake My Window
I Need You
Right now
That We're Gonna Raise The Roof Off Soon
An invitation to some
They Don't Understand
Each Time I Do They Kind Of Burn Right Through Me
We are forever, we are forever
And I Took Her For Granted I Was So Cavalier
Just the other night
Everything begins to set us free
She's giving hot tricks to men
Oh girl 
baby I've got what it takes 
Come together babe
I've Got The Feelin'
All alone she's in the ego zone
Be the latest
Oh, oh
When you look up in the air there’s a monster
To Be Trippin' On Me
To Stay
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky 
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
So Won't You Just Let Me Be
(you've been hit by)
Johnny's begging pretty please
Or dime too
Still intrudes the night
You Really Hurt, You Used To
This dude won't last forever 
For higher ground
I Can't Let Her Get Away
Wherever you may be
[Chant]
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
[Fade-Out/Repeat]
L'été finira
How will I make it when it's gone 
And make my mother smile... 
Beating her voice in her doom
They doin' what they used to hate
You gotta touch the one who loves you) 
One day in your life
See the evil one is you
And We're Gonna Ride The Boogie
Don't you break my heart
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
God is jammin' all around
(Leave Me Alone)
And Just Enjoy Yourself 
And The Pain Is Thunder (Yeah, Yeah)
The word is out that you're doing wrong
Give me your wings so we can fly
Somebody said, give up instead on how ya feel, 
They told me you should sing a song
Believe In Yourself
Out On The Floor
Tu me haces sentir
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
See, but everybody wants to read all about it
'Cause I'm On Fire
Gonna give you loving
I like the way how you're lovin' me,
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)
You're always in my heart
I used to glance beyond the stars
He really thought he really had
Oh, ah
Girl I won't forget you
[Bridge (Paul)]
You know
You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come
I'm indestructible,
He,d better stop treating you so bad, 
I mess with good women
If You Can't Hang With The Feeling
Kisses for your loving
Oh, my, he's got his Demerol
Now music, music and me
Just To Make It Right
I've Spent A Lifetime 
should have seen right thriough her 
Tell the angels no, I don’t wanna leave my baby alone
Unthinkable
To know this stranger
Ooh Stop Trippin'
'Cause I Know How
(Hoo! Hoo!)
He got kicked in the back
SpeechlessYour love is magical, that's how I feel 
We'll be present at the birth
(Just one more step) 
You Love To Pretend That You're Good
And you brought me back to the light
He's had his fall
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
You just sit around just talkin' nothin'
Is it me?
I won't convert you
People always told me be careful of what you do
Though I'm Begging
Reality brings forth realizm
[CHORUS 2x]
Miracles unheard of, hold on
I waited patiently
I speak a third language
And I Will Then Say To Thee
Listen, I've got problems of my own
Hee-hee-hee
It Is Friend Of Mine
There's A Chance For Dancin'
I Don't . . .
To see that the circus came today
I Can't Live My Life
My business, is your business
We Stop Existing And
Don't make it factual
Everybody say that time is borrowed,
What will she do to see the world?
Turn it up
How am I to understand
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller
There goes the sunshine
Even the little honey bees
Have you seen my Childhood...
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
And it's enough love for me to stay
Darling, ooooh, oooooooh yes, yes you can girl... 
I'm Gonna Make A Change
I'm living lonely, baby
Inside One Heart Could Find
[Repeat/Fade-Out]
I'm tired of being abused 
And Show The World You Got Pride
And She Says,
Pretty baby
You're aiming just for me
Only the strong survive
(Don't let it get you down, oh no, don't let it) 
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
Oh no
The truth the purity 
Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die
On and on and on it came
My friends come around and now they're gone
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 
[Laughing]
Cause we're almost there darlin'
And She Promised Me In Secret
So why make our lives harder (hold my hand)
She never cut from me
I'm gonna give her all the lovin'
And this house just ain't no home 
When You Feel That Heat
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
So, Annie, are you OK,?
I Just Want To Lay Next To You
Change the world
There's so many things we haven't tried
You Got Many Doctors
Don't Let Nobody Take You Down,Brother
Mysteries Do Remain
So Give Yourself A Chance
Right down to my bones 
Like A Trip To Heaven
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
Fortune And Fame, A Life
Touch Me
He got hair down to his knees
When This Is Over
If it's taking a chance
At Night Till Dawn
I won't be complanin'
So Open The Door
Ooh... In The Park
'Cause You Can
What do you get?
And I wanna make it up to you
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
(She Wants To Give It)
Damn self righteousness
If I had my way girl
dah dah dah dah dah people 
The girl with the tune
Vivir sin tu amor
Did God say that you could decide?
Confusions Contradict
(You are the lady in my life) Let me touch you girl
All my dreams been broken
The sweet loving you've been giving me
Michael, We're Not Going To Fight About This, Okay
That you said we were to gain...
Uuuuuuuuuuh Ahhhhhhhh.
You are there to help me see it trough, 
Girl, When You Dance
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
For someone to feel her despair
But I want her to be mine
Where else numbers two
It's black, it's white
No, if the angels took me from this earth
But I Love You Endlessly
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found 
'Cause All She Does Is Throw It Back To Me
Hard to convince her
Someone like you to call mine
Looking For Someone
From a far corner, out of the dark
We've come to far
Please tell my why
I'm So Confused
This time around I'm taking no s...
Our Love Is Dawning
[1st Verse (Michael)]
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)

This ain't no good for me
Let That Rhythm Get Into You

Doin' it on the highway, gotta have it my way
Something about you

He's got toe jam football
Don't let no one get you down

Too Low To Get Under (Yeah, Yeah)
His Ways
No One Seems To Let Me Be

From Sun Up To Midnight
Are You Ready
You Know That Love Survives
Is that your alibi?
Because He's Sleeping With
But I Say It Ain't Right If I Can't Give Sweet Love To You (Well, Ah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
I wish they would try to
[5th Verse]
(I Can't Be Still You Thrill Me, Baby, Be Mine)
'Cause your love is alright, alright
Stand Up!
it cuts you and it stabs me
Just watch your mouth
Sister's marries to a hood
Lift Your Head Up High
Long as we love each other
But nobody to be found
And the darkness is lighter now
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
You’re fearing me, ‘cause you know I’m a beast
As long as I know you'll be there, girl
I still remember
I was disgusted by all the injustice
Na Nah
I Can See The Signs
I've been around the world getting off the chain
I Gave Her Everything
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
It's Never Gonna Fade
Look at you little girl
It's Gonna Feel Real Good!
Yes, I Believe In Me
And this person or thing is soon to be met
I need you around

Rockin' robin'

Sans toi j'ai froid
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
I know you

You've Got To Stop It.
A Thousand Times And Why
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
You Can't Close Your . . .Your

And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
Getting higher
You know, I was,
Ah ah
I Love You
You can never kill me

And I'm really mad
Some things in life they just don't wanna see
They say that love's a word
Is there a time
If You Can't Feed Your Baby (Yeah, Yeah)
That ain't what it's all about
You're fighting to survive inside a killer, thriller tonight
You're so damn disrespectable
The storm clouds stay away, yeah
Us Holding Hands

That girl I can't take her 
Porque me has dado

So young and so fair
For a love we used to share

Stay away from strangers
The thrill for the money
In broad daylight
And Get Your Feet Back On The Ground
Though you don't need me now
How does it feel
You put a knife in my back
If You Cant Feed Your Baby (Yeah, Yeah)
Let’s not wait, the sun is out, let’s get up and let’s get out
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can (if you just, if you just).
Don't you black or white me
You Kiss Me Then,

I tell you I know it's coming soon
You torn apart, understand me now?

It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,
You turned and you walked
You've got no reason to frown

If I Can't Be With You
Ain't it good to know 
Each time I see a rainbow
Life Ain't So Bad At All
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
Asking me to come
We're almost there darlin'
Gonna, gonna put you down
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
Favourite Winter Coat
And it's true
Feel the vibe cause I can feel in mine
Gonna tell you right
You should have started long ago
Young politicians fight for poverty
She told me she forgiving me
You can cry on my shoulder... 
And tell me you like
Bring her good times 
On My Knees
Demerol
Babe, Hee!
My love is strong now
In our small way
We're Sendin' Out
It's tough for you to get by
she only knows how low that she can go 
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - come on, you know
Nine five shaq represent with the Thrilla
Walkin' Into Darkness
You ever want something 
(Keep doin' it)
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart
In the raw they don't know what you saw
I give you my heart
When you cry part of me's gonna die
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go 
She Gives It To Me
Well, My Life Ain't
No time for castles in space
Why you wanna hit me? 
See what loving has done to me

If you smile
And takin' morphine

Look at my heart, burning is all heartbreak
Don't Try To Fight It
Got to make you mine
She disappeared into the crowd
Warm You In My Arms And Melt Your Fears Away
A hold on me
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
Lay it on me
Your brother's gone and kissed
Just places
Satisfied
And then she wrote: 
No force of nature can break
You're so reliable
that you know you shouldn't have 
Get Your Ticket
No matter where I go or what I do
Have We Lost Love
Will I Do)
I'll be a man the way
Stay with me, I want you to stay with me
In my eleventh hour
Of happy with your feelin’ blue
All The People
I want you to... 
If you stay I'll find a way 
When you're near me
Then you will swear it

Got With Janet
Just you ask, I'll come back
Watching people lose their lives
It's all I need, that's all I need

Don't Let Nobody Take You Down, Brother
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
Oh father, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before
If heartache's what you want
But right now I just feel cold, so cold 
Lift Up Your Head
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
One minute after the end of time
She pulls up the covers
You are the king of the hill
Your Ticket Right
Cuts through the air
We're bad for life
We Have The Truth
(Ooh!)
and I know you hate it, and you can't take it 
I . . .I . . ., Aaow!
To turn around
Big girls ain't supposed to cry, 
Don't understand it
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
My Lonely Days Are Gone-
Even burst the breast
Running Often Through My Mind
But You're No Damn Good For Me 
Be With Mine
What about the days
You Know, Girl
When and how I get down 
Let them all materialise
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew
And you have to say you looked at me

And Angels Sing
Tellin' Lies And Rubbin' Shoulders
Is it really over
You And Your Manipulation
If you ever look behind
Here's what you do baby 
And it told her out tonight
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
Now Baby-Hee!
Should I get down on my knees and pray
Will surely keep the doctor away
A soldier must do
Don't you, don't you let go
A real life traffic stopper

If I Can't Stop!
My head's in a whirl
Give In To Me
I just want you to take me, take me
The ups and downs a carousel
Were As Sharp As 
Exactly What We're Doin' (Yeah)
Je ne veux plus tricher

Every word that you say
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?

Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
The world is the biggest school
See how cryin' has left its trace
Somebody's out
Because She's Mine
We are forever
You never said goodbye
And you're cold inside
I've never done you no wrong
Remember The Times
If you are the one for me
This World Is Heavenly
Then stand here in my shoes

You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Don’t know the worst, she knows a atheist
That burns in my heart
I was wandering in the rain
You can look at them climbing out the bushes
I Try So Hard To Love You
Do You Remember
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
One And 3
Turn each problem into play
Singing a rock and roll hymn
You're taking morphine
No hay quien me de lo
Mind Is Like A Compass
He say one day you will see
[ROD SERLING INTRO]
(Always the lady in my life) All over all over all over
(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl),
All my mama ever did
[Bridge:]
You're Preachin' 'Bout My
Say it again
She Cares
...I really wanted to do
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
J'en tremble rien d'y penser
You're so satisfying
I Gave Her Passion
(He Say) Pull Over Boy And
Come on babe, come on, oh yeah
Ain't Nobody's Business-
She was struck down, it was her doom
(I Guess It's Still You Thrill Me, Baby, Be Mine)
Blazing 'Cross The Evening Sky 
Share My Feelings In The Heat Of Love's Embrace
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
See, if the police don't take it 
So Just Leave Me Alone
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Dang gone it, baby!
Tell Me Will You Hold Me
We Made Our Vows
Like fantastical stories to share
Don't Scream And Shout
You just a rival
Hoo!
Baby come love me 
We'll Work It Out
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when 
[Verse 2:]
Asking me to love you
(and he’s moving in the air)
Because You Know What's True
Y diremos adios a la tristeza
[Michael] Na Na Na Na
that’s a monster, monster, monster
It's A Promise So Untrue
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go
You’ve got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
No no don't mess around with me
Kick me, kike me
while growing, still a child
Lost as a little lam was I, till you came in
She got your baby
[Chorus (2)]
I'm gonna write you back
Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines
Endo smoke got me choked and I'm hopin'
To be over what he had
Causing grief in human relations
You Stand
I am sure of it
To be the stranger 
It's got a lot of power,
Has become my daily need
Hee!
Maria girl you know you were the only one 
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
To blame him if you will
She ran underneath the table
To fly away just like a sparrow
Won't You Stay With Me Until The Mornin' Sun
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come.
I can't take it 
(Heaven must be wary) 
(Love Me And Feed Me)
(Lift Me)
We've got a good thing goin', baby
Dirty Diana
Oho yeah yeah,
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
You are there like the laughter of a child 
Make A Better Place...
The Girl Was Dangerous
Was try to take care of her kids
To erase the past 
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
The Way She Moved
I'll find a way to sail my course
She showed a photo of a baby crying
Let’s pray for all the lost children
She know your game
Like You Understand
Lovely, is the feelin' now
You'll Be There For Me
You Didn't See-Her Eyes On
It's really too soon
Have To See
[VERSE 2]
All I know is
And Don't You Pretend 
Like Ben
Il m'a vraiment tout apporté
She plays a game with such an innocent face 
Left behind everything, for the movie scene
Yeah!)
I don't wanna fly away
Ain't No Stop And Go
Don't Play The Fool For The Rest Of Your Life
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
So get closer (closer now) to my body now
We're gonna change the world
This Is The Truth, Baby
Relax Your Mind
I Pray This Punishment
If I had only reach out
Can't you see that I'm in love 
Exactly what you wanna see
There's sound of the melody
Prentending you're giving them love
I've raised other peoples to watch my back
Today he wants it twice as bad
Do it for me, cause baby
Like A Rainbow
So let love (oh let love) take us through the hours
Sister don’t read, she’ll never know
Though She Acts Like I'm
Love is here to stay...
Now I wake up everyday
This life don't last forever (hold my hand)
When it seems so hard to be the only one
"A man has been brutally beaten to death by
won’t you just let me be
Ooh!
Leaving Susie alone
No more tears, no more pain
It isn’t. It’s the beginning.
And that my daddy had no gun
What about all I've seen?
You're rapin' me off my pride
I was the only one around (the only one around)
I'm so at it
(Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
So children please listen this world is yours
Her direction has a dimelight
I am forever.
You better stop
Take away this never ending sorrow
You're doin' morphine
Friend Of Mine
You made me love you
The Girl Is Mine
I Have To Pray To God
The thing you see
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)
Dead and stuffy in the face
But I can't make you stay
How long can we wait?
You Cannot Wet It
Time And Shame
Over You... Over You (All Night)
Lost my heart
If You Keep The Faith
But You're No Damn Good For Me
When In Your Presence
I'd choose you babe
They use me for the money
Will Get You There
Any Road That You Take
Kicking me down
There's nothing that can't be done
There Was Something Different
Feeling the world standing still
Then The World Will
Father never lies
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
He bag production
She's The Scene
A haunting ghostly treat 
The lies are disgusting
That We See
So don't send no doctor to my door
She kept on walking
[1st Verse]
When Wrong, Will You Scold Me
Ooh, oui, oui
Ooo
You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)
I'll Wait For You
Hey hey hey 
You Know . . .That Man
But oh so sad when it ends
I told my mama how I feel about your power
That you’ll even sell your soul just to get a story sold
I Can't Take This Stuff No More
When you live, in your love
My father always told me
In My Anguish And My Pain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...
Liberian Girl . . .
When you're out of school
(We've got forever, forever)
Don't delay this
I'd like to take you places
In despair we'll be the hope
Right up and leave daddy
Can't you hear them cry
There Are No Secrets
You Got To
Is there in your eyes
All I can (yeah, yeah, hold my hand)
Did She Find Someone Else?
She waits her life away,
Yeah Stop Trippin'
You Have To Rub It
It's gonna to kill me
Couldn’t take nobody loving you the way we were
Call on me
Paint the town so pretty
And This Is Our
(You Gotta Get It Right, While
It asks no questions why (ooh)
Brighter Than Tomorrow
Gotta Hide Your Inhibitions
Take)
Now If They Ask You
You're gonna leave her one too many times
How much I love you
Treacherous, Cunnin', Declinin'
I'm up again I never let you down
Acha-Ooh!
But Here I Go Falling Again
Make)
I'm done in my pain, don't you feel no pain? (No way!)
We can change the world tomorrow
Then Why Do We Keep
Just want your cut from me
You Baby, Ooh!
Maybe it could be my friends
Watching you when you sleep, when you’re in bed
You're Just A Product Of
You got blood lust for me
(if I ain't stop!)
And Still You Said Goodbye
Sayin' You Just Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
Never Trust-First Impressions
(I'll give you my heart)
And We Can Ride The Boogie
Hee! Aaow!
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to
What about the man
I have a wife and two children who love me
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
Girl You Got To Hold Me
If you can't get enough
Mind!)
Worth Living
You Do This To Me
[Intro]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
So undesirable
You Know?
So tell me girl, it's not too late 
I Swear There's Something
[Verse 1]
It's Livin' Here Inside Our Hearts
She works in a restaurant night and day,
I've got the fastest feet around
You say you wouldn't do it
Because I want to be
Got It Ready
And Don't Forget The Faith
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Lo que das tu
(Won't you give me some time)
Tired of the schemes
It's gonna come around
To always do my best
Am I the beast 
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Hell all up in Hollywood
I wanna squeeze ya
It's Time To Come Alive
This time around
This Girl I Could Not Trust
Cuando amanece
The Girl Is Wasting Over
High Heels On
All right
So long, bad times
You've Got To
Don't Waste Your Time
I heard you're packing to leave! 
(Ooh girl let me keep you warm) I wanna give you all
What about killing fields
I'm Headed For The Border
No You Won't See Her Kiss
Before you loose your heart
Ben, the two of us need look no more
The nights are gettin' darker (darker) (hold my hand)
'Cause You're The One For
How can I begin again
(She wrote) 
We've turned kingdoms to dust
I Never Felt So In Love Before
Don't cry
To just be called a part of God
When you return to your hometown
I will show you you're the lady in my life
Now it's coming through the walls 
You make me shine
If we raise our voice as one
Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)
Another drug baby
And I'll be all you'll need
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
There's a card in my hand
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh
Do-Doot-Do, [Etc.]
I Told My Brothers
Like the night follows day
Kicking it loose
Well lord have mercy
(he left the bloodstains on the carpet)
(Aahh)
That's why I've got to be there 
Morning glow is here at last
The more you know you shouldn't have it, 
Look who took you under
Oh with a child's heart
And then one day you get it, 
The way we want them to
We Make)
(Ho!)
(How Can I Get To You ...)
You're Right)
And that old north wind 
Gonna change the world, Hee
Damned Indecision And Cursed Pride
You Cannot Cleave It
The heavens are falling down
That's Because They Don't
Drop As A Honeycomb
And Get Your Self-Respect Back
(are you OK Annie?)
(Always the lady in my life)
They know your every move!
Ways
I love a reason
They've gotta hear it from you baby
I Promise You Now That The Dawn Will Be Different
I Knew Right Then And There
If you show me the cash
Your sitting in your room 
(Change . . .)
(And the whole world has to answer right now
She Touched Me
You got to touch the one you love
I Have To Find My Peace Cuz
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)
You'll Never Make Me Stay
You say it's not a sin
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
Hear Her Voice
A hot buzz baby
I Watched You On The Floor
It's Getting Better All The Time
Coming at ya rather too fast
You just call out my name 
Don't take your love from me 
(Feel you with the sweetest love)
But They Told Me
Tell me what has become of my life
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See, I
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
And Girl I'll Give You All I Got To Give
Just to tell you once again...)
Mama say mama got you in a zig zag
[in background:]
I'm Stoppin' At Nothin'
Break of dawn, I can see it in your eyes
If You Want To Know Why
I like the way how you're touchin' me,
You Gotta Know When It's Good To Go
Just to tell you once again, 
3 And 4's In A Bundle
But things don't always turn out
On The carousel
Has turned from a fantasy
And taking its fearful toll
Ya smilin at me while, ya stealin right before my eyes 
'Cause girl, you came and changed
Ooooh... 
But I'm Only Human
Just Like In The Movies,
Just to love her
Oh, I’ll never let you go, come here girl
Happy, oehoe happy
Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Baby don't leave me 
But now it's very clear
('Round and 'round and around...)
The System
I Know I Am Someone
There's no mountain high I cannot climb 
Chika-Chika
Hand in hand where dreams never end
Eccentrialities 
Take my name and just let me be
That's the time you must keep on trying
It's Just A Feeling
I'm such a swine baby
On the go
I'm Starting With The Man In
Another Part Of Me . .
Take A Look At Yourself, And
If I had a nickel for everytime
The word's got out that you're on the line
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
We're on a mission
We Could Fly So High
Your Eyes Are So Lovely
Till now
That you are not alone
I guess I learned my lesson much to soon
Oh baby you give me butterflies
So if you just hold my hand,
Create A World With
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
(Just to tell you once again)
(Cause we're almost there) 
Susie's got your number 
Can turn us around
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
Take me by the hand
Give It To The Fire
They don't see you as I do
Yeah
Wanting No Break Time
But if you came to see 
I'll start beginning with the ABC's of loving you
She should have spied down his skin
That I've been lookin' for
When knowing in my heart
It's the man of steel organizm, twizm
I
You'll find that life is still worthwhile 
You'll do anything for money...
Mother's preaching Abraham
Who's Laughing Baby, Don't
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
I Think The Whole World
Everybody gone bad
So Tell Me
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
(That Doesn't Mean She
"Do You Love Me"
I Gave Her Time
Wishing our families well
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
But life is still fearful
Hee, Deep down in my body,
Hoo-hoo!
(Holy Mary moly Mary)
Who Is Special In Her Heart
(My Lonely Days Are Gone)
If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I Have The Stuff That You Want
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time
Since I Met Her From The Start
C'est la vie avec toi
Ooh! I Love You Baby, I Want
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
Liberian Girl
baby)
Frame him if you could
So Your Tongue Became A Razor
Will You Be There?
Because It's Just A Matter Of Time
Got To Give It
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face 
What can I do but wait for you?
This one’s for all the lost children
Just Make This Thing Come True
The things that would show that they cared for you
To see you again 
Then Why Don't You Just
Woo!
(She's dirty)
Who's the next for you to resurrect
That the magic slipper's
Before You Make
Stop being without you 
Don't give up
Oh yes I will, yes I will 
Don't need no fortune or fame
And Get Your Mind On Track
I Gotta Really Burn This Road
(Bye, bye) 
There is nothing in your eyes
Pass the way I do
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
Ah we're almost there
She cries inside everytime she feels this way
She'd be sitting here beside me
Some Time
And no one told her why
It happened fast
So paparazzi, get away from me
Love you girl...
So they fake it
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Let gets up and never stops, no
Rearranging Minds
Your Walk,
I don’t want the sun to shine I wanna make love
If the angels come for me I’d tell them no
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
You'd better look back it'll all be gone
...it won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
[Stevie]
Pony rides for a dime
I start try to make it look like I was around
[CHORUS 2]
Not alone, Not alone
And now you're gonna get it
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
I Tried To Hide This Affair
Yes, we're one and the same
Can the heart reveal the proof 
Don't turn around
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know
The moon is the enemy
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
Love will grow through the years
Or Put It In The Furnace
I just feel so good, so good 
But my friend you have seen nothing
Farewell, farewell
You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy
Oh, don't let them 
And with all that I've been through, 
A lifetime Love forever true
Lay your body close to mine
Satin Lace
Let this love lift you up
Baby, I promise (hold my hand) that I'll do all I can (hold my hand)
I Want To Go Too Far
That they made...
Being miserable alone (hold my hand)
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say
If we all cry at the same time tonight
With your fear and sorrow
In all of the time le da da dum (Mumble) 
You Can't Hurt Me
'Cause if you don't stop
Times And Tears For Fears,
You'll seeeee.
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you
We're Gonna Have To Tell Him 
But now there are others who sit in a room
Just not what you seek of me 
Cause what we're searchin' for
I Thought She Had To Have It
I've got so much honey
Don't be callin' down babe
That Aren't So Sure
Jam Jam
So It's One Or The Other
But knowing just why they're scared
Then comes the snow
Love today
If You Call Out Loud
How does it feel (How does it feel)
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
Bang bang, shot dead
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
Hee, We're gonna change the world,
Lift Up Your Head And Show The World You Got Pride
You're A Vegetable, You're A Vegetable
You Hurt My Baby
When You're Always Up To No Good
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold my hand, hold my hand
And she was well aware
Susie like to agitate
A Man Should Be Faithful
The Girl Will Be Mine
And Susie says its right
Why her father had to die
A monster had arrived in the village
It seems you want more
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
Como yo
Uhh!
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,
Why you wanna fix me? 
Places we once shared
Just a little o' your love, every day
That's right
Pretty Young Thing
Groove All Night
Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Doing it right
Like I've Never, Ever Known
In This Place You'll Feel
Your lyin' eyes
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
"Michael, I love you
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
No need to worry no need to fear
Your sitting in your room
What about sunrise
All along I knew you were a phony girl
There'll be no more wars
You are the sun
You're talkin' morphine
A Two-Edged Sword
You'll get by...
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...
Keep on reachin' out for me
She put seven inches in
[Both]
We can't take it
A Vow To Just
(And together we can make it all the way) 
Passion's Insanity
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah
She's Out Of My Hands
You're Everything This World Could Be To Me
Making it wet
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Let me be the one to straighten it out, girl
My happy arms will hold you
shiver a second, now, now, now, now what is it
But if it gets too rough
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Gonna Make That Change . . .
Love Is A Feeling
Gotta Get To You Baby
Everybody Just Get On Down
Got to have some loving
Back In The Spring
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It seems as if we have no voice
Cool My Fire Yearnin'
(Kiss Me And Free Me)
And My Confessions
He could see she was unable
Keep on with the force, don't stop
All we have to do
(Keep doin' it keep doin' it)
I still feel the need for you
I'm speedin' on the midway
So I've Learned That Love's Not Possession
When I come to you
And Care Enough To Bear Me
(Tell Me)
Deep in your soul and let God decide
On the move got fire in your shoes
Doggone Lover!
(Girl)
Don't You Get In My Way
Sensual Disguise
She Just Up And Ran Away
Wish the rain would just let me
A Turtleneck Sweater
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 
It don't matter if you're black or white
One blow to the head is all ya need,
Just remember I will always be around 
Oh brother please have mercy 'Cause I just can't take it
A monster, the worst thing to fear.
[Rap Performed By Heavy D]
Take me back
Your grandma's house was next to mine
That's So Carefree
(Close your eyes)
With seven inches in
Higher, higher, higher, higher
You won't live a quiet life,
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it 
[Paul]
(why did you do it, why did you, why are you stalking me)
That's the new word for today
for the Childhood I've never known...
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
You know I work to hard for this kinda play, 
This Passion Burns
And No Message Could've
Do we give a damn
Like A Castle
For all the money in the world
Smile, even though it's breaking
Yesterday is when I felt down
And Forever We'll Be True
All along I had to talk about it
Somebody's doin' it to
While the world goes spinnin' by
Every child should sing together in harmony
Want To See An Exhibition
The Big Boy Stands
[Rap]
I'll Be Your Night Lovin' Thing
Come Go With Me
('Cause we're almost there) 
To Jam [9x]
Because It's Just
Ain't no love in this world without you
Oh yeah-yeah, you better
I am tired of this devil
I'm Dreaming Of The Street
Just a little bit baby
I Don't Like A Lady
Just because you read it in a magazine
Euphoria never to feel frustration
And show her that she is my girl 
I'm the one to go to her rescue
And If You Really Try
(Rock me with your sweet caress) Lay back with me
MJ for life
Susie ain't your friend
That Makes Me Want
Never letting fate control my soul
Gotta Get The Leadway
When you find that you're always waiting
(Annie, are you OK?)
You'd crucify the Lord
And Your Feet Flat On The Ground
But only the man from next door
I Won't Stop Until
There's a tappin' in the floor
Ah Get On The Floor And Dance
I can hear your prayers
Did God say that they could decide
Keeping your head up to the sky!
My Baby Walked Out The Door
Of What It's About
In sight of me
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Let me touch you with my love
I Just Can't Hold On
Have we lost their trust
Is it me? 
Now yesterday is gone
So every night I say a prayer, 
With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
I held the tears back long as I can
That’s a chance I’ll take
I can't make it without you
You Got Homeless People
There's A Love That
Can’t stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
(Loving We Will Share)
Dance The Night Away
They Say I'm Different
She's from a world
Dirty Diana, No
Now I don't know where we are
But It's Okay
(You're just studying my mind)
Speedin' On The Freeway
The foolish trickery 
Todo mi amor eres tu
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
I'm from a world
My life is so complete
This Time You Won't Seduce Me
For Once In My Life
And She Knows
'cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
What about God?
And The Fool Who
I might tell on you
"I Do,"
The light through the window
Let Our Spirits Never Die
(uuh)
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh I, Oh)
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through
You Got It
There'll Be Problems,
Alone she lays waiting
But You're No Damn Lover
Don't get me
Hee
I am tired of this stuff
(If You Wanna Make The
But I'm home free for no thrills
[3rd verse]
There’ nothing left to do
Your will to self motivate
It's going down baby
So Keep The Faith
One blow to the head is all you need,
Break of dawn
They thought they really could control me
Settling down ain't my nature
You see
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
Tell Me
You made my life brand new
Press play, don’t stop, rotate, too hot
And I Sure Would Like Just To Groove With You
Who ran away
I Wanna Rock (All Night) With You Girl (Sunlight)
Don't shoot to kill
And It Cuts Like A Knife
And Bloodshed On The Street
I need her sharing the world beside me 
Take me back, forgive me
I took my baby on a river boat cruise
You better not shout where you gonna go
They really want to use me
Bring your loving and nothing else
And that's everywhere she goes 
You are the moon
You're the one that I adore
Biding a life, reading the words
Pour te dire amour, toujours, je veux te garder
Morning glow all days long
Am I scary for ya
(She's oh)
Although a tear may be ever so near
You Got To Feel That Heat
Get up on the floor
I see the door simply wide open
[Akon]
You'll see
The more you want it 
I Told You That I Need You
Together We'll Cry
I chase you every step of the way yeah yeah
Let Me Be!
Morning rider
If you ask me to lie
That’s why you got to be threatened by me
How can I begin to say
You really got a hold on me, baby
And I Don't Know Whether To Laugh Or Cry
Takin' Me Higher 
When my restless heart says goodbye
You know he really tried to take me
I can't even breathe
Through your fear and sorrow
Oooh, you are there, somewhere
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby
Do We Know Right
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere
I was alone, there was no love in my life
Helpless Like A Baby
Lovely is the feeling now
Fly Away
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable 
Then you will bear it
I've Got To Make That Change,
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Just to try and see you smile one more time
Smile, though your heart is aching
Shock Tacy
I dont know 
Happy, yeah yeah
I Can Say, Hey . . .Farewell
Nothing here means anything
Drop a line sometime, yeah
Your doggin' around
It Ain't 
I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom
(She's doin' it she's doin' it)
It's black, it's white, woo
Well my only fear
Slaughtered in vain across the land
Thriller here tonight
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
'Til that day you're really mine 
What About Us Girl
You can start again
Or Whatever We Do
Making a toast to the king
I'm humbled in your grace 
He's got Joo Joo eyeball
For A Favor
To make my father proud
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl
When you came to see your grandma in may
Is He Hot On My Tracks
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 
Stand Back A Minute
In The Promise Of Another Tomorrow
You know it - you know it - you know
So Why Did It End?

Jus' Tell 'Em That We're Just
With A Fever, But Nothing He Found
Anytime she goes away 
I Feel You Are All
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it
This happiness to me
You're my daytime my nighttime
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
Be Much

So take off the mask, so I can see your face
Sensation (ah sensation) lovely where we at (ooh)
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone

She's Touchin' Me So To Start
But tell me, ain't your child
Here One Day
Let me be, be the one to straighten it out, girl
Of What My Life's Supposed To Be (Well)
Dying With The Rising Of The Moon
I remember you and I walking though the park at night
Don't stop 'til you get enough
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
What Has Come Of
No hay quien me de lo que das tu
3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
I am the cover of the magazine, what a scene
Got A Hot Foot

I am the one who came when you fell down
Hit The City Lights
In the black
Ne comptent même pas
I Won't Give You Reason To Change Your Mind
Soy joven, lo se
Tschada dada dada daa

Keep flying until
Touch me and I feel on fire
So you call it trust
Just Simply Do The

One blow to the head is all you need
She's Got Position

We care enough
Y pregunto por ti
A smooth criminal
And Secrets So Untold
They'll hurt you and desert you 
Not alone ohh
He's just a bitch baby
You have to show them that you're really not scared
Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson
I was the clown
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real 
Heroine and Marilyn
I can't straighten it out, girl, come on
Tell Me What Will I Do?
I´m steady laughin', while surfacing 
Now The Way That It Stands
We're Bring To You
Ain't double same
Ooh, ooh
Chika-Chika-Chika
Who sings in the daytime at noon
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Once Believed In
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
That you pledge your only son...
I like the way you're lovin me'
Come On Be My Girl-I Wanna
I know ya name and the game is I own you 
KGB was doggin' me

Morning glow, morning glow
With a friend to call my own
Those abortion papers (Hoo!)
If You Only Try
Every day create your history
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever
Oh, girl, you're so together
Release two or three, when  I reach I can go ‘til I hit my peak
It's on my mind
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Uh, uh, uh, baby
So listen up
Back In The Fall
And I made it this time
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, oohh, yeah
For you only
'Cause If It's Aching
But See What Will I Do!
When you're feeling all alone 
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
You know I'm bad - I'm bad - you know it, you know
I've Heard It All Before, Michael
Give It To Me
Birds of a feather will fly together
Girl your smile, ooh
Dirty Diana . . .
And How You're Livin' Each Day
He wanna do something keen to you
She's Out Of My Life
Like The River Jordan
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
In the suite, on the news
Gonna hurt your mind
[Spoken:]
She's So Fine
Then Make That . . .
Hey!
Now that you are here
Now you can't stop me even thought you think 
Your dog's a bitch baby
I'll Be Okay
You said loving you
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
I’m telling you, when you lie under a tomb
We are forever, … keep on, we are forever, … keep on, have to be strong
Make me wanna sing
(Wherever I go)
Recognize Me
Don't want to kiss you but I need you
Friday's brighter
(We are here to change the world)
Tell the things you are to me and
Throw Away My Time
And as the years go by we'll stay as true, 
(Set me free)
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
A mystery so sullen in air
She's Getting To You
Keep on tryin'
I'm on that
Those Sweet Memories
The fool comes slippin'
Of disappointments and confusions
Every Head Turned 
Everybody allegation
Show You All The Magic That A Perfect Love Can
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
Every year, na na na
Than the love I can give
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,
What about the crying man
(Carry Me Boldly)
Je vais t'emmener
You know the lie, you keep it low
(What about it)
Like A Sunset
Loveliness
Don't give up our plans
I close my eyes
Tahitian tanned
We're ravaging the seas
There's a ghost out in the hall 
You suddenly appeared
When all the words keep turning down
and you control your world
Let nothin' in the world darlin'
Help Me Sing It, Ma Ma Se,
'Cause a madman's out tonight
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
How about New York City
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Today
(say you wanna go far)
(Why did you, why did you)
Don't Point Your Finger
(I Will Feel Blessed)
But that's the way you cry girl (Cry girl)
Forevermore
Let Me Take You To The Max
Don't you know?
Monster
Le terre pous trembler
[Michael Jackson:]
They don't really care about
Sister don’t know, where would she go
Look for the rainbow in the sky
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Our love goodbye
Set You Free
I need you by my side
Face The Problems
(It's The Choice That We
It's a turf war on a global scale
In Our Darkest Hour
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
He's awaken, ground is shakin
[8th Verse]
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
You Always Knew Just How To Make Me Cry
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about
And no one ever told me
(blood on the dance floor)
When evening descends
How can you cage a bird
Michael Jackson
I'm just a little country boy
She came and stood right by me
One sweet night I knew I would see
Into my heart
Baby I've got what it takes 
That's where I can be found
and you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable 
Some day you are, are mine
[3rd Verse]
Of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Our love's in motion
You're throwing rocks at me
I might drop dead about what I saw
Just come into my arms
The Self
Then Maybe Somehow We Can Work It Out
We shal have rhyme
It’s the price of fame!
Then a beggar boy called my name
Yesterday
You’re beautiful
And The Dream We Were
Just think of all the lost children
Locked your love away from me
Then It Feels That Always
A Broken Bottle Top
I think I might go insane
Tu eres quien gana
Am I scary for ya baby 
only for me, then spoke with her body 
(Free like the wind)
Gonna take you higher
I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom 
My brothers my brother Na
Sweet Seducing Sighs
Give me a reason 'cause
Just Promise Baby, You'll
An' congregate, illuminate
And tell me you like what you see
I don't know!
And you give me a chance 
He roller coaster
And Nothin' Really Matters
Way in a distant land
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
The future can't hold what your money can't buy
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
All your glory
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
With A Song
Let's dance dance with me 
Everybody's somebody's fool
I Wanna Rock With You (Yeah) (All Night)
And Scream Out To The World
So you go to church
But I can do anything, she's invincible
And Uhh, Little Self-Esteem
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
Dance You Into Day (Sunlight)
You know I'm smooth - I'm Bad - you know it
(Oh)
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
Telling me to love you
Even though I had to let you go
Is Just An Apple
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me
I Found Out Right Away
The Girl Was Bad
Ooh My Honey
There's No Hurt Or Sorrow
for the Childhood
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life
You're doin' wrong
I ain't scare of nobody
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
You ain't done enough for me
This is love for sure

[4th verse]
its goes on and on
No, No, No, She's Mine
Feel So Sorry
You Got School Teachers
Ain't Nobody's Business,
Grows dark and full of clouds 
It's On My Mind
Just Lift Yourself
Do what you wish, be what you are
'Cause I Just Can't Stop
Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,
The Truth Of Lust
We've been together for such a long time now
Another day has gone
Tired of you tellin' the story your way
It Is A Friend Of Mine
Then Tonight Ease The Lovin' Pain
Then Don't Have A Baby (Yeah, Yeah)
If I can follow through
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Ooh
She Said Later
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Oh, what I mean is
Keep on with the force don't stop (don't baby)
Like It's The Last
Give It To Me-Give Me
So they came into the outway
I Love The Way You Shake That Thing (Girl)
You stayed for the ride
To Just 
Faces fill with madness
And nobody's there...
Don't Let Nobody Turn You 'Round Brother
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
And Though I Find Myself Attracted To You
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
Just let God decide
Then Tell Me Just What
You got me scared, girl
For Awhile
Cinderella, I just know
Ain't no clouds sky came out number me, yeah
Blow rockin' robin 
Make The Move
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Born To Amuse, To Inspire, To Delight
But that's your hiding place
In your life 
[Together]
As you go your merry way
What do you say?
If We Try
Dom Sheldon is a cold man 
Standing there with the top of the round
The world's a better place 'cause you came in time,
Keep your head up, tonight!
Do it do it, he can do it, watch him do it
