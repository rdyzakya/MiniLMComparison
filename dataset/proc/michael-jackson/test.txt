Who are you
I wouldn’t wanna go if I can’t see your face, can’t hold you close
Aaow!
For which I have been named
I Tried To Mastermind It
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right 
She Looked Me Deep In The Eyes
Am I amusing you 
Understand
Start to fall
But You're No Damn Lover 
Girl, when the goin' gets mean
I can make you sunshine, make you happy
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
You're nasty
I'll never forget you
This Is My Life And I,
(Look at the lovers) 
Girlfriend
You sit around in the strangest place 
I Could Feel The Aura
She asked the men in blue
So don't be feeling no pain boy!
Too Much
I know, I know, 
I Love The Way You Shake That Thing Girl Especially 
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
J'en perd ma fierté
I see you coming in and off
He wanna fly high nigh high
Viva por ti
I gotta really burn this road
'Cause I've been looking around
Tired of injustice
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I'm bad - you know it
Father always told me,
You can feel his disease
And Yet My Heart Is Saying Come And Do Me
Don't tell me you agree with me
Don't take your love, no no no no no
And treasure the sums
[CHORUS 3]
He's tried
Playing it right
How lucky we are to be me and you
In your heart to forgive me
The whole world smiles with you
They just couldn't take it
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
And they have not a clue
Woe Unto Thee
Melodie, you're my symphony
But I Was Living In Vain
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along
A love that's true because of you
Get the boy and make him wait
She changed her name
My pocket were full and now my money's gone
Right Away Won't You Baby
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
Everybody dog food
Maria after all you were the only one 
So They Called Her Mouth A Motor
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)
(Doh)
Cause everyday I watch you
And see the world with your heart
You Got Me Workin' Day And Night
If you give it with guilt
She's Saying That's Ok
It's here inside 
Oh your smile
And She Promised Me Forever
la da da da da da da dum 
Step right up its circus time and get your moneys worth of love today
Moving round ha ha
See now why
Well they say the sky's the limit
But baby, you're not there
And Her Mouth Was
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
Baby, don't take your love from me
Can you feel it in the air 
Ya, tellin' me that ya comin to a compramise 
Gonna Burn This Disco Out
I Call Your Name . . .
Situation, speculation
Home, Not A Nickel To Loan
You feel love so deep
I Didn't Call On The Phone To
She never thought la da da dum 
And Don't Think Maybe (Yeah, Yeah)

So Baby, Be Mine, Baby, Be Mine
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me
You're saluting the flag
For Now We'll Make
Your country trusts you
C'mon Boy
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Who do you love?

She was there just sitting at the table
As the headline stories of
[1st verse]
Their Needs
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
The foulest stench is in the air
Whatever We Say
But Everytime I Did It
In the devil's game
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool
Because we care we love enough to share
Sister say she love him some
'Cause I love such elementary things...
Then Make That . . .)
I am here with you
You know, you know, you know it - come on
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
I'll Show My Brotha
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
Scream in my face then pushed you back
Farewell, my summer love, farewell
I like the way you shake it [x2]
He's got early warning
You make the sun shine
What about the holy land
You Better Take Advice
To Buy You Things To Keep
Can’t you see that you will always be
Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl

First I Cooled Like A Fan
Whispers At Morning

The way that you made me feel
living your live as Heaven
Message To You
Your warning me 
And I can hear her calling me.
She Got It Ready
Bringing Sparkles To Your Eyes
Tschada dada dada daa (That’s why I want to be free)
Bad news, bad news! 
('Cause When You Close Your
We've got rainbows yet to find 
Here I am baby come and take me
What about nature's worth
And take your soul if you let them 
Through all your lies and silly games 
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
All the song to me
Darkness falls across the land
No place too far for us
Ah But There's No Cure
I Long To Get By
I thought I heard you cry
As you got through life remember this rule
Oh baby you keep a-running away 
Everything we're lookin' for
I don't even wanna say it
Look who just walked in the place
And Splendidly Bright
Don't Come Beggin' Me
I Told My Brother How To Do The Thing Right
Is it scary for you 
Cheater...
(Lay Your Head Lowly)
Come On
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe
I'll never be alone
What about all the things
When she was taught that that's not clean
The Mirror,
Go On Girl!-Hee Hee!
No one wants to be defeated
We Can Touch The Sky And Light The Darkest Day
I'm So Humble
Don't take your love
Than We'll Ever Need
I don't understand it!
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!
You know baby
Cause They Got No Place
'Cause I keep kidding around
There’s imagination I bet you've never been there before
all the things you are, got to be mine
All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
All the girls have bringhten now
Just Aren't Enough
Susie says its right
(But that's the way you cry)
And you know, wherever I am 
Lay back in my tenderness
And we'll find them all in time 
Tales of what somebody told
Hey Baby Do What You Please
Hey
Too bad, forget it
The flowers will grow
Roll it
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . . . 
Baby the back
If You Live It Off The Wall
Don't let it get you down, oh no
Girl you've given him all you had
Tell It To The Preacher
And We'll Keep You Movin', That's For Sure
On A Cloudy Afternoon
(Take You Anywhere)
Hello tomorrow
I've Been Here Times Before
Baby I’ll stay, Heaven can wait
[Siedah]
Love and understanding is what you need
This could be a better place
I'll plant you a garden
Keep on with the force don't stop (don't stop baby)
What about heart?
In time I knew that love would bring
This time around yeah
The Love You Bring
And she, knows they got this to be 
Don't Let Nobody Take You Down
Give me a notion 'cause
You’re trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
Slippin' from mine? 
Te quiero y sola
You're doggin' me [repeat 7x]
Oh I'll Be Workin' From Nine
Get Me Out
And Hug Me)
My Very Soul
I don’t want nobody else to hold you
Just call my name, and I'll be there
Leave Me Alone
Give It When I Want It
The night's on you
I know his mother never taught himright anyway
I’d like to have my child (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
You've been so true 
But they are gunning for the money
Eat Your Ticket
You've Got To Move! Come
I Guess The Lady
Happy days will drown the pain
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
Go On Girl! Aaow!
Ooh!! 
Pretending Not To See
Love Came And Possessed You
Keep on reachin'
There's a ghostly smell around
Had a hold on me
He wanna give hot jump shot
It Ain't
They'd kill for the money
Into each life some rain falls
Like A Pleasure Trip
If I had a chance to choose
Oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should
She Told Me That I'm Her Forever Lover, You Know, Don't You Remember
Since you taught me by sharing your life
Look at my words, what do they say?
You've got a friend 
And you turned the key
In the lost and found of my heart...
The Reason That I Live
Too young to understand
I have to tell you
Just leave us alone, leave us alone
(Man In The Mirror)
That makes the world go round
I Don't Care What You Talkin'
For No Favors
Love is all we need
I Gave Her Money
Keep The Boogie Alright
Does It Lead You Home
The Life You Save Could Be
Près du feu de bois
I can taste it
But they say the sky's the limit
If you remember my name, 
You'll do anything for money
Aaow!-Hoo Hoo!
We were not to young at all
The fires deep in his eyes
I'm trying to get through
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
Kind Of Love
and when you bury me underneath all your pain 
[CHORUS]
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
But You Got To Keep The Faith Gon'
I hurt my backbone baby,
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me
Change!
How To Do The Thing Right
Prepared that are a shame
(Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh) 
Winds of change are set to blow
When I wasn't strong
I couldn't believe it
You know I always will love you, I am forever
Da de de da de da da dum 
Then There Ain't No Room For You This Part Of Town
The World Keeps Changing    
You keep me so upset
Like A Comet
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah
Want To See You For Always
Hoo Hoo!
Oh baby, baby
Hey Baby Do What You Want
For The Living
You must be out of your mind
Dreams don't last forever 
Et danser tout l'hiver
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee 
If I Let Her Get Away
Just wait 'til I get through...
Lovin' You Will Be So Right
[Chorus x 3]
I Asked My Neighbor
For Me There's No Tomorrow
Hold you in his arm 'til
Look who got slapped in the face

Make you mine
I only want to show you
Rise and do it again
And I won't give up the fight
and stop talkin' aboout you 
He wanna lay you down
The Baby Boom
In the scheme of life
And now all I have is memories.
It’s a chance I’ll take, maybe I’ll stay
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
Let Us Down
Come on back to me Maria 
Never did
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life
Got a hold on me
And A Paisley Cut Top
Every time I wanna say it
I don't want ya 
[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
(Won't you write me back?, please write me back) 
You'll remember the love you found here
I've seen the bright get duller
Faith is found in the winds
And soon I'll be there to brighten up 
The break is on me then what do you got
And You Can Say The Words
Don’t get so confused
It’s got you bouncing off the wall
(that he struck you a crescendo Annie)
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
I don't want ya
So Baby, Be My Girl (All The Time)

Makin' Funky Tracks

So Baby, Be Mine (Baby You Gotta Be Mine)
I just wanna touch and kiss
You Got To Keep The Faith
Within Myself
You know where you've been
I saw your face and nothing else
She Looked Right Through You
Woman To Man
That's Why I Want You To
And everything I own I give ('Cause you rocked my
Then you better prove you're right
Honey, Come Set Me Free
And Though I'm Trying Not To Look In Your Eyes
Yeah yeah yeah
There's a rocking in the chair
and start being without you 
With the biggest smiles
You broke my heart into half
By The Time This Hit The Street
There's A Chance For Groovin'
[Repeat To Fade]
And then someday they may recall
It's not warm when she's away 
One Thing In Life
There'll Be No More Mountains For Us To Climb
With Not Enough To Eat
Baby I need you
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
That's Much More In Demand
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear
I'm living lonely
Refrain
It's so insane
You Got A Way Of Making Me
To make it up to you 
And when all calls
No Matter How It Starts It Ends The Same
Gonna Say Things To Ya
Écoute-moi mon amour
Taking you away from here
I guess you'd say
“Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine.”
She say this face that you see
(he’s like an animal)
No need to worry
Y cuando no estas
Go on, baby!
I'm Asking Him To Change His
Answer right now
But we still can change some things today... 
Oh No . . .
For every day to start
And girl, I'll never get enough
She's Composition
I Really Love It
Luchando
I might still be touching you
Got Fire In My Pocket
Make you just wanna scream
(Show Me You Care)
I tried to keep my sanity
Stop it
And when you come back that
When Morning Awakes Me
I’m everything you need, so tell me what’s the deal
Things come and they come and then they go
Je me sens si bien de t'aimer
Stranger in Moscow
My life began when Happy smiled
He came into her apartment
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Control of me
A love that I cannot hide
Beat me, hate me
Let's harmonize all around the world
Assassinate and mutilate
See, don't you do it baby
You Know How I Feel
(Before You Make)
Don't You Talk To Me
A man and a woman's youngest son
There Are Ways
What about all the peace
I was afraid of life and you came in time
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
That's The Man
Oh hear my plea for sympathy 
Once all alone
Smoother Than Oil
I Hear Your Voice So
Conceived In
So when the going gets rough
Then you will hell him
(Hold Me)
Then she looked at me
Why you stab me in the back? 
If I'm Always Out Of Sight (Ooh)
Oho yeah, oho yeah, oho yeah
And Party On Right Through The Night (All Right)
Since you seduced her
Ain't it good to know
I don't listen to a word they say
But my friend you have seen nothin'
For forty days and forty nights
You closed the door to your heart, girl
Am I scary for you baby
A word we've only heard
No there’s a lesson to learn, respect’s not given, it’s earned
She Said I'm All Yours
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Oh, for God's sake
(do think twice.)
And sweep this whole land through
Hoo! hoo!
We shall have each other
Anything now
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
She's Got The Look ...
Talmud Song
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)
Leave Me Alone-Stop It!
So what does it mean
I'm so excited how you
Not Enough To Eat
Tell me what has become of my rights
Is What A Man's Supposed To Do
With you?
A Strange Woman
You Say That Workin'
And she's always gone too long 
(just like an animal)
(left bloodstains on the carpet)
She's Got The Breaks
That's right, I want to be
fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin’
And will the sun ever shine
In My Trials
(I want to be free)
I won't resent you
All right...
Baby I love you
Till Dawn, Two Or Three
(Fairytales, make-believe and you)
(She's holy Mary moly Mary)
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
I can live, I can breathe
(Lay back in my tenderness) Lay back with me
I really get it when you're
With this smile upon my face
I Felt Taken By Lust's
"I Do"
Deep in my soul
Ooh, The World
Give It To The Feeling
You Just Want To Give It
When she's around me 
Baby I want you
Will Shine Again In Grace
As jacked as it sounds
If you know it's a lie
Ho...oh...
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
(Ah)
('Cause There's A Time When
Four Walls Won't Hold Me Tonight
I don't wanna see you in mysery, so come on, baby come on
Back to where I should have always stayed
He innocently questioned why
And give you all the love I have inside
Of popcorn and candy
You Got Strange Diseases
If the angels came for me I’d tell them no
You gave me hope when all hope is lost
Just Stop Doggin' Me Around
You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing 
The crying Earth the weeping shores?
She's Mine, She's Mine
'Cause
Tell me girl, it's not to late 
As I turned on the TV this evening
I Am The Damned
Here abandoned in my fame
Don't let it happen to me and you
Or He May Never Let You Go
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
We're Gonna Rock The Night Away
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
Just like you
It's up to me and I'm still alive
There's a creak beneath the floor 
Money...
(it was your doom, Annie!)
I'd choose you babe, yeah
My World
Somebody's out to get me
(Take my time wherever I go)
There Ain't No Way To Stop You Movin' Good
So Come And Go With Me
You sit around in the strangest place
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
With No Food To Eat
He want your vote just to remain TA.
Everyday I sit and ask myself
Across The Morning
Won't be no romancing
All my fairytales are coming true
Performed before your very eyes 
She innocently questioned why
Girl when my life got stormy
I Found Peace
She called me to her room
Everyday is a holiday
People make the world go 'round
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
(Always the lady in my life) I love you I love you I need you I want you, baby
Someone's Always Tryin' To Keep My Baby Cryin'
You saw he didn't run
Ah! Chika-Chika-Ah!
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Grab a song and come along
When the sky above you 
Execute The Plan
I got it coming and it's ecstacy
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant 
[RAP ]
Melodie, you're my everything
I don't want you but I need you
Theirs a goul beneath the bed 
Heartbreak enemy despise
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
Be God's Glow
(Wooh)
(Hee-Hee Hee-Hee).
I Can't Help But Love You
MJ number 1, it’s goes on and on
What Are The Possibilities
There's something you ought to know
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
[Background]
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
Heal The World
And my heart would then be whole
The cake and the crumbs
Just show your face
oo you sexy
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it - you know it
Make That Change.
And soon you'll hear me 
Then Tell Me, Just What
Stories buried and untold
When things would hurt you
To the music got to love that filled my mind
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side 
(Don't let it get you down) 
Dirty Diana, Nah
Why you wanna get me?

[P.Y.T.'S] Na Na Na

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
You Cannot Burn It
Flying high like a man on a trapeze
With a child's heart
I need your love
(That's Why)
So tell me is it scary for you baby
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night

And the sound of your voice

And everything I own I give (To rock my world)

The world keep on spinning does the future know? 
Tender Lovin' Care

Just because you know I love you so much

I Swear I'm Keepin' You
He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Got to be there, got to be there

So pray for all the lost children
Got to make somebody
Then Let Me Take A Bite

Trading In The Passion For That Taste Of Pain
Maybe you didn't know that baby
(pah dah dah dah dah)
I Can't Let
There's No More I Can Say
Make Your Move
You Got Grown People
What do you think of that
All the blood we've shed before
In The Park, On The Beach
Home with me
Knockin' at your door 
Especially 
A fall down the stairs
We need each other,
Baby
She Wants To Give It
You think there's nothing wrong
Don't let it get you down
You really want it

I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my

You can never break me
Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'
You'll remember one day . . . 
That rides on the night
Like a child, but pardon me...
Like music, music and me
And You Will See
She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
But Till That Day I Said You've Got To Keep The Faith!
Join The Party
To Get Your Dreams Up Off The Ground
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
False Prophets Cry Of Doom

Don't you ever call!
I'm in love with a beautiful girl 
Stop Trippin'
To a circus girl
I Don't Need It
Stop It!
She said to keep your mind on dancing
For no mere mortal can resist
Keep on, keep on
Skin head, dead head
Come to me, let me be your one and only (hold my hand)
I Am The Agony Inside
More Precious Than
Faraway hot island
Just walked away
No Fear
She Said I Have To Go Home
Though your love is not for me
(Goin' on now)
It doesn't have to be that bad
I can’t explain, I’m all alone
(then you ran into the bedroom)
It's going on baby
I need her sharing her world beside me 
Oh yes, I did forget something didn’t I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.
I'm a get down dancin man
Seems That The World's
I Took My Baby To The Doctor
Don't you wrong or right me
We're gonna change the world, girl
Kick in the back baby
What about babies
Am I invisible because you ignore me?
My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
Keep The Faith
And then think of my blues!
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
But That Don't Mean That I Don't Know Where We Are
Who ran away.
all hell, run tell, the King has risen
She Knows I'm Watching
You can cry on my shoulder 
She knew no one cared...
Determined To Be

Or Whatever We Do To
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
Je me sens fiévreux

Just to pursue her movie star dreams
And when things fall apart

Empty words are not enough
Dirty Diana!

Just To Check Yourself Out
And hold you in my arms
Starts to glimmer when you know
Girl, if you take your love away from me 
Cuando no estas

Trepidation, speculation
But in your presence I am lost for words 
Make A Better World...
If I could change in a second
It seems to me
Keep your head together 
She never cut baby
I've got all the riches baby
But I Was Too Blind To See
Don’t you, don’t you like it
In The Back Of My Mind
You Must Understand
(Then Tell Me, Just What
'Cause You're The One For Me
Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson
To win the fame baby
To One Town
Takin' Me Higher
no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here 
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Yes you do, you're doggin' me [repeat 3x]
It was Sunday, what a black day
Happy Tears
Their Swords
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight
I love a notion
'Cause I'm Real Tired You See
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
Someone is taking a life, hold on
With you? 
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
Your burdens I will bear
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Pull Over Boy
You're a parasite in black and white
I promess you that...
Yesterday you had his trust
The Way She Came Into The Place
I'll Shake You There
Burnt despite our pleas
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine
But the kid is not my son
We Could Really Get There
To Make A Better Place...
What about love?
Tonight is your night but this is what you loose
You'll remember me somehow
Is my mind I can hear
Hustlin', Stealin', Lyin'
So let love take us through the hours
(Message To You)
(Lord have mercy)
Just Take It Slow
If you're dealing with God
Take It Like You Want It
You Can Be A Winner
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
You are the breathless hush of evening
He wanna turn the key
There's a ghost down in the hall
Ooooooh [x10]
No Fortune
But after the snow
But if Roosevelt was livin'
(I give you my heart)
[Ad lib fade]
Then we'll add up the pleasures
What about all I pray
Or just confusing you 
Doesn't Love Me-Ooo)
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
Deseos de vivir,
Although I know we've drifted far
Is Still Making Up Her Mind
Keep nasty
(My girl, my girl) 
That you've got a friend 
I'm so lonely I'm so blue 
I've Got To Be On Time
And No Shoes For Their Feet
Though She Acts Like I'm Not
If you show me the man
And you need some love and care 
Float Across The Sky, High
Ugh!
You Are All The Future That I Desire
If You Only Let Your Feelings Through
How Can You Live Girl
So Make A Better World
Everybody wants to read all about it
(yee-aah, why are stalking me)
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind
(Abortion paper)
You know me
Que yo no puedo
Gon' Keep It Brother
Exactly what you gonna see 
God is jammin' on the run
Get your tickets right away
Heart)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Start Living
I can't even see!
Police Brutality
Kept My Love For Her Locked Deep Inside
I read the paper
Livin' Crazy That's The Only Way
Waiting for you to find me
We Can Dim The Lights
Like stranger in Moscow
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Well, After Loving Me, She Said She Couldn't Love Another
The long and winding road
Little children laughing
If I can show you baby
Of greed and lust
In This Bliss
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"
Don't Come Lovin' Me
The funk of forty thousand years
I can make you feel so right
You can look at them coming out the walls
(aah) (pah dah dah)
Now We're Just A Web Of Mystery
(it was your doom)
I Love You More Than He
I Wouldn't Help It, No
Another Part Of Me
Living the way that you choose
So Take Your Weight Off Of Me
Take my hand, don't let go, baby, hold me (yeah)
Would get embarrassed for every time
He’s an animal
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
I'll Take You There
And don't like what you find
All The Time
Web Of Sin
Could never hope to top
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
And show her that she's my girl 
Sayin' that you got it good
All Night... All Night
Just love me 'til you don't know how (ooh)
God I Need You
Tu voz me llama
The word is out
world)
Scratch My Shoulder
Gonna Make It Right . . .
You By My Side
And when you're gone she'll know
Shoot to kill
Shiny And Sparkly
Como la brisa
Born to be wild
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
When your spirit's on the ground 
(I Will Be There)
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
[P.Y.T.'S] Na Na Na Na Na
Baby Loves Me
Then dial a star
And It Will Be Soothing
Look At Yourself
When all the things you are, are mine
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold my hand, hold my hand.
I haven't left you alone
That Is Just Beyond Your Reach
But The Power's In Believing
I thought the grass was green on the other side
I Don't Build Your Hopes To Be Let Down
It's Aching, Make It Feel Alright
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
On my thought yeah yeah
I know it's you and me
But I have not the words here to explain 
la da da da la da da dum 
This is for all the lost children
Y me hace feliz
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
Just Promise Me
(Save Me)
No no no no, no no no no
It's time for us to make a choice
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
When Nobody Else Is Talkin'
Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme
(There's A Time When You're
Life is just a thing you don’t
Slam dunk ha ha ha
Each Time The Wind Blows
Give me all your loving
Tears fall like rain
Please don't disappear
(Like Ben) 
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
Everything we said and all we done now
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
Set Me Free
Deep down in my soul, Baby
The feeling of terror
And You Changed My World,
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
(You are the lady in my life) doo doo doo
We're almost there
Down by surpriseI bet he missioned with the CIA
I Wanna Rock - Rock The Night Away
And He Says So Endlessly
Morphine!
I believe you and I
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
But I’m keep singing
We're talkin' danger
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
(Your smile is scary)
He say "I know you, you know me"
Girlfriend You Better Tell Your Boyfriend (Yeah)
Shake Your Body Won't You G'on Get Down
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
In Each Other's Eyes
Like You've Never Seen
I pray to leave my body,
Keep on with the force don't stop (love power)
(What about us)
Promise me we'll always be
Confess! To steal the great achievements of the people, the accomplishments of the workers..."
Beggin' Back Mama
Better off being together (hold my hand)
It's beautiful to watch love begin
You Doggone Lover, Hee . . .
Hurry, hurry mister postman, take my letter tell her i love her
(Lay back in my tenderness) You're my lady, baby
Oooh
Day that you'll come back to me
My father never lies, baby
And bring all your troubles to me, yeah babe, yes you can now
It Only Cares For
Let us walk down the park, makin’ love ‘til it’s dark
Say That I'm Alright
Cheater... 
Yeah Yeah
Scandal
Time After Time I Gave You All Of My Money
Though you're gone star far away
I've Been A Victim Of A Selfish
(Hoo, Hoo, Hoo)
And you are there, 
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
Your talk is cheap
Took Me By Surprise
Here Comes The Man
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
(Free like the wind babe)
Monkey see, monkey do
By word of mouth you are on the news
Love that's sweet and pure
Those abortion papers
If you're on that lonely night 
When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
Gonna Dance 'Til We Burn This Disco Out
[Chorus 2x]
I'm on my way back to you
We Can Change All The World
(Ha!)
To tell you how I feel 
It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
Knowing how much you loved me
[2nd Verse (Patti Austin)]
Go face the worries of the day
Then the smell of sweet perfume
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
It's not my thing trying to get back
Don't you go
Baby Be My Girl
Like A Perfect Flower
Life Ain't So Bad At All (Live Life Off The Wall)
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
You make me sick baby
You Know . . .
I Need To Find The Truth
Too-My Love)
And I’m singing to keep from feelin’ blue
You Can't Abuse It
Then I will fake it
'Cause you're not there
I got rhythm and a whole lot of soul
there’s a monster
I've been dreaming of meeting the picture
Doin' It On The Highway
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
[Michael (sample)]
I Don't Believe It
So just let it be
(Why do you keep stalking me)
Sayin' that she got it good
And It's Okay
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
Que das tu
Or Paris, France
All is grand, all is bright
That Got Away
That’s why you’ve got to be threatened by me
Better Freak Across The Floor
her only goal is just to take control 
But she left me for another man
