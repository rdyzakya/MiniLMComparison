Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
(It's warmin' up) can you feel it, baby?
Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda.
where I am
No matter what you do
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ...
Gonna dance the night away Love just don't come easy
To keep you from walkin' out the door. 'Cause there'll be no sunlight
Once in a million times
Our precious jewel has returned
Guess I've always been this way All these roads steer me wrong
Shawty Left The Scene Oh! Before Then We Got Seperated
What else could go wrong
My body's a 100 degrees
Never been afraid to roll the dice
Every day's a new day in love with you
[ Lyrics from:
Contigo es donde
bout your body, body, body
I told myself I wasn't gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry, no no)
Just hold on I promise you
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind
Oh everywhere I go they be like (ooh, so player ooh) Now, now, now watch me break it down like (uh)
Cause tonight it's you and me
Walkin' with that troublesome guy" But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
leave the past behind me, today my life begins
Nooo Noooo
Girl when you smile
Uh Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops
Oh-oh-oh-oh
My mommy told me to give them a call.
Find out what we're made of
Funny how time flies when you're in love
Feels like I'm on fire (fire) Ohhh, ohhh
Don't believe me just watch (come on) Don't believe me just watch uh Don't believe me just watch uh
So leave a message at the tone
Told me she was a squirter
I just hope I sing bad.
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
So far, this long distance is killing me There's only so many songs that I can sing
But you don't look like you're scared
Well here I am, baby, here I am, baby
'Cause at the end of the night it is her I'll be holding I love you so
I see myself I'm looking at the Mirror on the wall, here we are again
My friends ask me if I wanna play ball.
That I hold close to see your face again With you is where I'd rather be
Right is your ticket to ride
Oh, I still dream of simple life
But you don't have to ask You know I wait for you
And once you cross the line
Cause a girl like you will come around like
That's right We out here drippin' in finesse
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
driving me insane! Chorus:
Well I learned just a little too late
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And I'm on the outside
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
This can't be how our story ends
Shut that shit down on sight
'Cause this ain't Wonderland
Girl no need to be nervous,
No no no I just want to work you baby
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
I'm trying to make her see,
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
Just let your fire set me free Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
So let's ride, we can get freaky tonight
Why do I make it hard Oh, taking roads that lead me no where,
We don't have it anymore. There's no religion that could save me
But I'm no Frankenstein
You know I'd do anything for ya I would go through all this pain
When you find the perfect love
Oh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl Versace on the floor
I don't want it to stop, no
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything Nothing at all
Talking to the moon Oh I'm feeling like I'm famous
Don't leave even one drop
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
Just the way you are And when you smile
We'll be alright Hello
So wrong So wrong
Me gustaría que estuvieras aquí conmigo
She's got me losing my head,
That somebody could come along and just
Or is it these dancing juice?
oh but i it's just the mail again (the mail again)
(Oooh)
Oh, girl
And put your hands up, up ,up
And I'm like a cup
And now i'm feeling lost
But you just gotta decide
All I have is this picture in a frame
Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
You know it, you know it Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
I should return my card
Honey you're my golden star
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
Que ella no sabe realmente
Stop (stop)
But I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong,
If you're ready, like I'm ready Cause it's a beautiful night,
Buy your own drinks on your own grind
Así que ...
And now were livin the dream
Underneath the chandelier
I'll be the first to say welcome back
Now I know you didn't get your hair done so you could just sit down and just sit still
Just don't know
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
Leave some morphine at my door
So I'd do it all over again Oh, who ever thought a day gone
Got kiss myself, I'm so pretty I'm too hot (hot damn)
Removed all my doubt So believe that for you
Got nothin' to lose
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) yeah, yeah, come on let's
oh no no
I watch the whole room change
(Looking Like A Star Girl)
And I can beat her drums
And I'm running outta things
It's gotta be with you and no one else.
Waiting on the other side We would live forever
That's why I always turn around Here I am again, doing things I said that I wouldn't do
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows You've been livin this way so long
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Never had real love before
If you ever need to smile again girl, take my card Razzle-dazzle, never gon' stop
Let me feel your body now Girl you're the only thing that I see
Let me feel your body
Oh, yeah, you know who you are
For when I'm a billionaire
Every time you're standing next to me
Only when you're lonely, lonely
El único que sabe
Baby here we are again, ooh I can see it in your eyes, you want a good time
It's late in the evening.. evening
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
pero estamos atrapados en esto
the voices, the voices, the voices
But you think that you're on your way
Just the way you are When I see your face
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Hey, hey, hey
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wonder
Blame it on my confidence
But when will I learn to just put you first I come to you now when I need you
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
I'm all about you
Ooh!
I saw something worth my future
I'll be ok tomorrow. Here comes Junior Gong, I'm flying high like Superman
And held your hand
Watch her drop it like (Down, down, down) hey,
Stylin', whilen, livin' it up in the city
I'm losing control of myself this time.
Now my baby is dancing
oh just gotta get through the day
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got, got, got) Oh it's not complicated so this won't take a while
'Cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
Can you feel what I feel?
Every time I love ya... How do I end up in the same old place
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
You know right now I can't be home
Above us all the stars are watchin'
'Cause every night
Take her right from me
When we are
So used to feelin pain
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl I unzip the back to watch it fall
Today my life begins... Everyday I wake up next to an angel
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like You say you want a good time
We're looking for something dumb to do
Y dile a ella todos los días, que sólo va de la mano
Y me estoy quedando sin cosas que hacer
Bad bitches and ya ugly ass friends (haha)
What you tryna do Cool jewelry shining so bright
There's that smile I'm looking for
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
All the eesha's waitin' on me
That place we went the last time, the last time, oh Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
oh, oh, oh (oh oh oh oh oh oh) Look at her shinin'
I'd do all over again for you
Just like the clouds
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire I'll be playing basketball with the President
I was your man and you were my girl
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,
Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once
'Cause you know how I like it use a dirty little lover
And there you were to sweep me away
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
Your head down to your heels
You know you look even better than the way you did now before
Is to press it Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
I could wait a whole life time
My attention, oh, yes, you just took it
When will I learn to just put you first I, I come to you now when I need you
And right there is where I wanna stay Cause your heart takes me to paradise
Feel that you should be concerned.
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
I get lost in the words I say
Standin' on the table sippin' ace of spades
Hey Oh it's not complicated so this won't take a while
Lemmi tell y'all a lil' something
I'll be the first to say
Dancing in the nude.. nude.. nude ohhh
Lift off and say goodbye
Break it down Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
I see your soul through your window pain
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheeps clothing
I'll be spending time with you
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
'Cause once we get going, we rolling, we'll cha-cha 'til the morning
I know I can make it, today my life begins Life's too short to have regrets
So far Can you hear me crying?
You've passed away as mere coincidence
That's why these boys be like (aye baby, aye baby)
Only when you're lonely I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Don't believe me just watch (come on) Don't believe me just watch uh Don't believe me just watch
Yeah, you, you, you
Inglewood's finest shoes (whoop, whoop)
'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money

What y'all trying to do? (What y'all trying to do?)
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,

It's unfair, she's out there Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
When I was your man Tonight
That's why I always turn around for you, you you, youuu. You, you you, youuu.
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire

So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Tears running from your eyes
Oh no, my God, I'll do it
(the voices in my head)
She can't help it
That much I know, yes I know All these roads steer me wrong
Girl no need to be nervous, no, no, no,
Ain't nobody that can love me, like you love me.
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful
Damn I look just like my fuckin' dad
Everything twenty-four karats
We're feeling freaky (oh) I want you in my bedroom,
Wanna tell her
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello

If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
Just watch her dance in the mirror.. dance

Slide with your boy to the bar
Give it to me motherfucker Oh look what you doing, look what you done
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real So just turn down the lights (down the lights)
Come on girl serve me the dish The lights in the club are turning you on
To every girl that I meet here, this is what I'll say, Run run runaway, runaway baby

Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
You just think of yourself and never me at all

And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
You know the moments are right
See you when you cry yourself to sleep

Cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
I know girl, when you look at me
Shots of patron
No no no, don't give up (Repeat x2)
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows Chorus:
Everyday's the same back to the train (uh) next stop Brooklyn
You're the only thing worth holding on to No matter how far
All I went through led me to you
Noo-Whoa Whoa Whoa
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
It seems like every other night you pick a fight, fight.
Where Did She go
Let me feel your body Just press your body,
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Aunque estoy lejos
When we are called to help our friends in need You can count on me like one two three
Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand
Oh yeah yeah
Just the way you are Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say When I see your face
Now tell me who's the fairest
Somewhere far away
Start believing my own lies
The neighbour's gonna make the call
I put you on and now you're feelin' right (straight up)
Yo no quiero ser,
'Cause how could I ever leave
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
Pretty lady
Just take me the long way home
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Just back it up on me girl, right now, right now I got your body rockin' side to side (straight up)
Every morning I watch her from behind
More beautiful than words could say
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) ah, ah, ah, ah
Do it tonight
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose.
and you're out there on your own
Feels like I'm on fire
Sayin' "There goes my little girl
But you won't do the same If my body was on fire
Ooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Ive Been Looking For Her All Night Im Looking For The Girl
I think I want to marry you Is it the look in your eyes?
But how this turned out
he taught me to say the words I can
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Feeling like I run this whole block.
So I ain't got a thing to lose.
I'll get right back to you" Damn, damn, damn I'm calling, calling, calling, calling all my lovelies
Hey, hey, hey, oh Before we leave
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Cause I gotta be up at 6
Light it up, that's smoke at mirrors
Who cares baby
Girl, to tell you the truth
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
Esta distancia me está matando Hay tantas canciones
(Don't you give up)
But swimming in your water is something spiritual (spiritual) uh!
The only one that knows
If you let me treasure you oh oooooh Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
Y es tan difícil
It took us a lifetime to find each other
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood
Then pat, pat, pat 'til it's flat I'll say it again
So you better make the best of it I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Take me to a place where I don't care,
But I still drive them all night long, all night long All you young wild girls
But you won't need it anymore

You put them on and you feel great,
Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo:
And close the door (close the door)
Hoo ooh ooh
And I tell her everyday Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
Wish I didn't have to go
I' ma give you more (more) more (more) more (more) Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
Girl, I, I choo-oose you Chunky

I know you could make my wish come true
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it Look at me when I'm talkin' to you
saying she'll come back this time is it strange that i talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are Treasure, that is what you are
But would that be selfish
Cause you make feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Esta distancia me está matando Es tan difícil
Don't speak boy just listen
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
I even look good in the broken mirror
Ooh, you never do the same

Floor Floor It's a beautiful night ,
voices in my head
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
So why don't we just play pretend
So come and join us if you dare-dare
¿Y qué va a tomar
Spend the rest of my days here
Said you got it if you want it, take my wallet if you want it, now Jump in the Cadillac
But every time she ask me do I look okay?
Que tengo muy cerca para ver tu cara todos los días Contigo es donde
Tryin' to get to you
no puedo estar en casa
But ain't nobody gonna save us now (oooh)
But at the end of the day
But keep the five, twenties tens and bens completely separate
You can be my fleeka
Every time's a new way, every time I love ya...
Yeah, you, baby (baby, baby) I spent all my money on a big old fancy car
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Estoy tratando de hacerle ver,
if she dared me, i do it
You're all I have At night when the stars
Do you notice me,
It's you that I'm missin'
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
When I was your man
Oh welcome back I say welcome, welcome, welcome
And since you're the only one that matters
Oh no, look at what you started, baby
Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver,
It's always been you
(When we are) We're so far, this long distance is killing me
If you see her tell her I'm coming
No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo,
But she's dancing with another man Although it hurts
¿Puedes oírme llorar?
That Girl That Girl Where Did She go
Want me to make her cum
Let you have your way
I shoot her in my veins
Oh Verse:
Guess that's what I waited for Never believed that things

Que yo estoy tratando de encontrar una manera,
to never say i can't
Hey BP, looks like I did take 'em to mars this time So why are we talkin' to each other again Man, look at you, been walking in here looking all pretty and angry and mean and good

So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops. 'Cause my job got me going nowhere,
Anything you want
Alright but don't change your mind, don't you change it, oh no Oh yeah you called me today, drove all this way
Waiting on the other side If they say life's a dream
Oh, I want you to know I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe And then here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye (Oh, don't you give up)
You don't know how I feel
I know we all have a similar dream
And I'm running out of ways to break through
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
The way you press your body on me
So you still can't see Everyday same old things
Spend the rest of my days here Cause you make feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
Dunking on his delegates
Julio, get the stretch
To keep you by my side
Oh Hey, hey, hey
Can't get her off my brain, my brain, my brain
It can be better than this
Knowing that you're all I want
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Now we're both turning red
Hey girls
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like I wanna be a billionaire so f***in' bad
Telling everyone
Everything's been so nice
'Cause '68 cents ain't gonna pay the rent,
Cause baby girl your heat's (your heat's)
Oh, I can't wait no more Oooh [Chorus:]
In hopes you're on
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong
Yeah, I'm so glad I found you
You're probably the finest thing that I ever seen
I can't pretend
That she don't really know
I'ma come and give you some love
Then rubs on her lotion.. lotion
This one for them hood girls
For these bright-eyed hunnies
Even though the day went so wrong
Don't feel like picking up my phone
Never wanna put my heart on the line, uh!
Let Me See You Throw Your hands Up
Oooh I know i'm probably much too late
So don't you take your body from me
for me it was my old man
Throw my hand in my pants
You can make a sinner change his ways, uh!
(Ooh) With you is where I'd rather be
Oh (oh) Oh (oh oh) Keep crawling up touchin' ya', kissin' ya', lovin' ya'
because of my dad I now know my son better
Can I preach (uh oh) can I preach (uh oh)
And you don't need a man to know who you are
But I want you to know
What you got a man? I don't see you with him
Turn up the old Victrola
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
A sad and lonely thing
When you undid my seatbelt
Now I'm left here brokenhearted, baby
Stand up, but then you fall, don't think you can skate at all.
I need to know right now
Ohhhh
Just leave your problems on the shelf-shelf
You only want me when you're lonely
'Til the birds start calling my name
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen Oh every time I close my eyes
But you're the first girl I met Baby girl you're shining like a star
Tell her she the one, she the one for life
I'll always come back to you, come back to you Oh I got a bottle full of liquor with a cocaine
Lou vuitton pumps to match the hand bag
That you give to me
And listen to my heart
If you want it, girl, come and get it
Cause now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely Oh, nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
Let yourself go freely and I'll
And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If only a moment, if only a day A place where you feel safe and warm
Don't matter which way you go
Wish we were more than friends She knows better but
Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más.
it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
voices in my head it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
You better, you better, you better Run run runaway, runaway baby
If I Gotta Almost Search The Whole Club
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
yo prefiero estar
What's on your mind
Everyday I will
Girl I'm doing
'Cause you're amazing
There's nothing more I can say
And you don't know why Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name
She only go to the church where dollars fall
This is me and my liquor store blues. I'll take one shot for my pain,
I wonder we we'll ever meet again
And I know I do the same, be callin' you out your name,
(oh-oh) burning up
Twenty four karat magic in the air
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
And I always will be true
Cause once again shes gone
If I knew one day you would come
Fresh out the mall in our brand new fits
But she don't know
only have one life to live
Girl you know you're perfect from
Her brain just got a doctrine
oh oh oh oh oh I would go through all this pain
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
this is her i just know (i just know)
Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
Spend your money like money ain't shit (whoop, whoop)
Oh how could I be so lucky
Tell me what do I do And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
While she's wrapped in her towel.. towel
Who sits alone
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Girls, what y'all trying to do? (Do)
Sometimes you drive me crazy, but I love ya, baby
Baby, that's what you do
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby Jump in the Cadillac
She wont return my calls
I can't wait no longer
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Lady and I know
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
I see that guilt beneath the shame
but his words were always there to help i wouldn't be
Known to give the color red the blues Oh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (keep up)
Your eyes saying please me but your lips care to ask
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So why you contemplatin', playa hatin'
Just take me the long way home Your telling me aint no rush to stay there's no delay oh oh
Ooh! I've been working hard so long
Take a look in that mirror (take a look)
(When we are) We're so far this long distance is killing me

Girl won't you listen?
I wanna be a billionaire so f***in' bad Oh every time I close my eyes
It doesn't take a lot to read the writings on the wall
I didn't notice what time it was
You wouldn't do the same
Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me
I'll sing a song
Lobster tail for dinner
Aint no rush so can you slow down
And I tell her everyday. Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
i get dressed, i put on a smile
She's taking her time
Cause when she gets naked
Oh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games
i just know or am i imagining things
I think I wanna marry you. Just say I do,
Im Looking For The Girl
It matters how this ends
She's still comfortable
The way you are
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life With everything happening today
Whiskey coming through my pores,
Me estás volviendo loco! Estribillo:
Show her how to lay it back
Dance in the mirror Hay tantas canciones
I spy with my little eye
Juicy and Louis Vuitton
And once again I'm moving on And I just wanna hate her, I hate her, I hate her
No she don't go where preachers preach
You'll put your hands out in the air, you'll catch that ball, yes this I swear Don't give up, keep on going.

So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything After all the things you put me through, ooh still I come right back

If you sexy then flaunt it
I see the pain hidden in your pride

It was you and me against the world Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
I know I can make it, today my life begins I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
We'll be alright Throw our hands in the air

It hits your belly, your chin and toes.
She better run The good lord better bless your soul

While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night
(Oohh x2) i gotta find my way out of this hell, you got me into,

But I think she feels I'm already lost. Maybe I'm trying too hard
She goes by the name where your stacks at
Girl show me, you got to you got to show me
Then kiss your lips
We got dinner reservations.. reservations
And shoot her in my veins
Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby

I wonder if we'll ever meet again
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on Cause I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
someone's talking back
But I still look good though
Uh, ah yeah Well let me think, let me think, ah what should I do?

If you let me treasure you

No need to worry darlin'

Come on now
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
And nobody at the party droppin' it low like the way that you do
Talking to the moon I know you're somewhere out there
She better run Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
But I'm coming home soon, coming home soon
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
Oh Strut through the club yeah they know we so paid

Cause you know that only you girl

Sayin (Ladies is pimps too) (3x)
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah Oh, oh
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain I'll never be your mother's favorite
We don't care so we say I' ma need to
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it
Slide with your boy to the car
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Drop (drop)
For too long, for too long Oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you sure look good to me
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it, Chorus:
No, I won't blame you
Called a police and a fireman
Cause my heart breaks a little
That Girl That Girl I Mustve Seen Her Beauty At The Bar
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see,
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
My love is like a gunshot
Sorry, I can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number
Feels like I'm on fire Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
But i guess i wasn't wrong
I see the love in disguise
Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?
oh oh when I was just a little boy
(fine, so fine)
se sienten como horas
Singing to the city lights,
We out here drippin' in finesse
My temperature is higher
To realize what we used to have,
It was fun girl Don't say no, no, no, no-no
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
I love you Mom, you always be my favorite girl.
You know I'll say When I see your face
Thirty-seven, twenty-seven, forty-two, ooh
Girl you make me so hot (hot)
No, I wouldn't have done
No you won't need it no more
I want to be your woman
Throw some perm on your attitude
Only when you're lonely
Saturday night and we in the spot
'Cause I know we can work it out
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn Ooh-ooh-ooh Girl, I bet your momma named you goodlookin'
Who could ask for more
Cause I loved you, loved you, loved you

Everything is alright, everything is alright Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight

I just wish my mom . she is best favorite girl
That place we went the last time, the last time I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
She Could Make A Blind Man See
And I'm gonna give it to you Cool jewelry shining so bright
She Was Gone Before I Could Say Shit
To picture the only one you wanna love
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart
no I won't forget a thing
Que alguien podría venir y apenas
she wanted someone that's perfect
We're dancin' all alone
She better sleep with one eye open
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Wake up with no jammies (nope)
In Spike Lee joint I'm Gator, I'm Gator, I'm Gator
I'll be ok tomorrow. Now greetings to the world! You best believe! Oh (oh) Oh (oh) Ohhhh
The only one that holds me down
So take a breath leave me and
But every morning sunrise it says
Waiting on the other side It's better if you don't understand
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
That's the way it has to be
