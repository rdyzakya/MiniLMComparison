Never wanna do this again
Para la celestial ...
The only thing I need from you girl Is to press your body,
On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life
But it don't sound the same
Don't give up, don't ever stop,
vuelvo a casa pronto. Todo lo que tengo es esta foto en un marco
If you let me treasure you You are my treasure, you are my treasure
And I've learnt how to leave it where it is
You got me sayin', "damn girl, break it down for me" Take it nice and slow, let me watch while you turn around
Oh, baby, please, let's leave the past behind us So that we can go where love will find us
I won't say a word...
So fill me up Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
(Just to put a smile on you)
Oh come on girl Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow
They agree you shine like gold [Verse 2]
We've found the perfect love
That I hold close to see your face everyday With you is where I'd rather be
Or is it the dancing juice?
Take us to that special place
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Let this be the way we remember us
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
It's like your body strikes a match I' ma need to
Her laugh her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
If you getting naughty, baby here's my phone
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
My players pass has been revoked and now they think I'm soft
That place we went the last time, the last time Tu-ru-tu don't you never look back
You told me that they can understand the man I am
Oh, look what you making me do Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby
How could a day be so long? Never believe that things
All I need from you Is to press your body,
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
You can't change your mind
I pray it's never too late So tell me, why, why can't we try and start again?
Straight up and down Now greetings to the world! Standing at this liquor store,
I'm born again every time you spend the night Cause your sex takes me to paradise
It's 3AM and I'm rushing out the door to see you
You better run, (you better run)
Uptown funk you up (say what?)
No one will know
But they don't know what I know 'Cause when the sun goes down
(ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah)
To build some kind of ladder to the sky Trying to find some way to see
Our song on the radio
But show me show me show me tonight, yeah oh oh oh (x3)
Siente esto debe ser.
and you can't see a thing
Long turn on a dusty road
Ooh, I know exactly what is on your mind
(Oh, tell me)
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
I'm too hot (hot damn)
And I don't care who's knocking on the door
A rocket couldn't reach it
Or is it this dancing juice?
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
You're the only thing worth holding on to
My body's a 100 degrees (ohhhh)
And you're screaming give it to me baby
No one knows me like you do
Don't believe me just watch
Touching me so gently
I know you feel the same
Just take me the long way home Wish I could stay all night
Haha
And tied it with her tongue
Cause she never seemed satisfied
Until you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
y las horas se sienten como días
Very day's a new day, every time I love ya
So let's go, so let's go (we got the club like) (hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) and all the girls sayin'
We both know what we're all about.
Can I move on I'll get out of my own way,
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
Don't it feel so good to be us, ay?
What you want is what I got
We'll be alright It feels like, ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time,
Before I put my spell on you
I know there is no tomorrow
There's no reason to hide
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
Could turn out so lovely Everyday I wake up next to an angel
Don't fight the feeling, invite the feeling Just put your pinky rings up to the moon
You want me closer to you
A little bit bigger now
Let it fill you up Dim all the lights sweet darling
Yeah I'm a monster
Head to toe so player
To try and apologize for my mistakes
Go with it, go with it, go with it
So gone, so gone, so gone
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got)
Girl, you gotta relax (ooh)
Don't believe me just watch come on! Don't believe me just watch uh Don't believe me just watch uh
You tell me all day that you're lonely
She Made Her Body Go Down
I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire
You and me baby we'll be fuckin' it like gorillas
For too long, for too long Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
he'd carry me
And in case you didn't hear me I work (hard for this money, money) Checks in the mail everyday
I tried to play piano but my feet cant reach the floor
A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta.
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy I'm too hot (hot damn)
Look all around shes gone My homie say I'm trippin
right before he passed
Do it fast, do it slow,
I have to do what you told.
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
I'm talking to the moon
A chance to come in from the war
How do I expect to get there
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes Then show me, you got to you got to show me
Wanna get up on it It's a special thing that we be doing
Going ninety five in our brand new whips
(yeah) We'll be alright (uh-huh, ha-ha) We are young, we run free
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
it's like i'm dreamin that walls are closing in on me,
It's tearing me apart I know you wish you could see me
So just say alright (alright) If you ain't here to party take your ass back home
You got a booty like woah, wait a minute!
I wondered if I'd ever heal again Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
And everybody that's around they know that I'm not myself when you gone
If that'll make it right 'Cause there'll be no sunlight
But I was wrong, cause only with you
Nothing at all Easy come easy go, that's just how you live
Girl,I'm losing my head,
Not a place I'd rather be
Everywhere I go they be like (ooh, so player ooh)
You're everything I see in my dreams
Nothing at all
Us girls we get it in, money just like them
Just the way you are Yeah ¿Qué estás loco?
You're as straight as they come
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
Trying To Get To Her Before Shes SoberS Up
I can't wait when till the next time I see you (uh) home home Take me the long way home
But I caught the next train
But show me show me show me tonight, yeah
I think my baby's gone
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh you're a sexy lady

Girl I can't live without my heart
And you won't know what it's like
Alright! Come on baby, I love you
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, uh!
Bitch say my name you know who I am
Esta distancia me está matando Ahora los minutos
When I had the chance
Jackson, Mississippi
And it's killing me
Now lean with it (lean), throw a lil' sheen in it (sheen)
But she's dancing with another man My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Oh I love you more today than yesterday
Just the way you are Yeah Oh, i was perfect
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
It's unfair, she's out there
Come on here and show me why you got the whole club starin' at you
Just (press it, press it) My favorite place is that space between your legs and your hips
But girl you make me nervous,
(All the way)
but his words were always there to help I wouldn't be
Yeah I've gone mad
When our friends talk about you
Oh, and now you know
The fire trucks are on their way (oh their way, oh!)
Yeah your heart takes me to paradise
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) the whole world sayin'
Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
If she loved me, She'd stop me But noo
but I just choose to write a new single.
A girl like you should never look so blue
Got our friends, got the night
Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Never wanna put my heart on the line
Girl, you gotta relax
You know it, you know it Now slow it down for me baby
It all just sounds like (oooooh)
So stubborn, thinking I know what is right
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
We keep our purse full of cream
I'm not trying to leave you know
oh and the only thing he asked
Twenty four karat, twenty four karat magic
I love you Mom, you always be my favorite girl. I love you Mom, you are my favorite girl.
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on We out here drippin' in finesse
Green farm flat bush checking every corner shop
For too long, for too long
if my father didn't tell me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she doesn't see what I see
Oooh
You got it if you want it, got, got it if you want it
(Little did I know)
I swear the world better prepare
the voices in my head (the voices in my head)
And I don't see nobody else
But I don't miss a show
It's all right we got you
para sacarte de mi mente
It matters how this ends 'Cause what if I never love again? Oh, oh I, I was a city boy
Oh Yes I said it
(yo, yo, yeah, d-don't it?) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Throwing that thing from left, right, side-to-side
(every time you're standing next to me)
You know it, you know it Fellas grab your ladies if your lady fine

Estás tan lejos ¿Puedes oírme llorar?
Ladies grab your fellas and let's do this right

pero vuelvo a casa pronto
A different city every night oh right
But life proves me wrong every time Taking roads that lead me no where,
And I see that I was wrong
I lost her in the cold
Waiting, all day, but now you wanna call me
all around me i can feel a change (ohh) I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
You'll be begging me, please please please
Come on, dim all the lights Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
little party, party, party So good,
My neighbors think I'm crazy
Write you letters just to prove
Spend the rest of my days here 'Cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven
If I knew one day you would come Now, baby, now, baby, now, baby
You're gonna get there just keep on grooving
Ladies holla if you feel me Chorus:

Wait wait wait for you oh See you down there everyday
Esta distancia me está matando.

Red Nike high tops listening to hip-hop
Loosen them shoulders up
They agree you shine like gold
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's our first time Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Money money money make her smile Im Looking For The Girl

Ooh and it hunts me every time I close my eyes
Well Okay

That's why I always turn around Baby, before you say, say,
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
Can't I just stay here

And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had s***

If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
she watched me try
Get drunk, toast it up, we don't give a fuck We are young, we run free
And her dance to perfection.. perfection
Oh every time I close my eyes I see my name in shining lights
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
I'm a fool that played her game Hey, Natalie, she ran away with all my money
That's why I wanna hate her, I hate her, I hate her

Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
I'd do it all over again, do it all over again

So I'd do it all over again for you I missed the first train stood out

All you young wild girls
Hey baby
Well try and try and try some more, and soon you're skating across the floor. Don't give up, keep on moving.

In the corner of an empty home

We fuss, fight, and scream,
But I can't do anything
