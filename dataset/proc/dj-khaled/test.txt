So it's only right
Okay one car, two shoes
Lamborghini got a S, Sierra Leone baguettes
I'm thankin' the Lord 'cause I'm blessed
Niggas talking down on the crown
Let's put in ice on your watch and designer on your body
Oh my God! She hit me up all day, give no response
She love the way, she love the way
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'mma take you away
Put an end to the world like Mayans
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Manderlek brida manebki rlek
I'mma go
I know them big racks won't fold, yeah
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores
Yeah, I had the girls sick
I was young
('Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I) Thank you so much for coming in my life Me and daughter taking over
Until the day we through
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
Yea, Birdman in a Benz wit' the duffel stuffed
Fly as 57 passenges
Got my B-A-B-Y in the two-seat
Baby, okay, okay though Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie no
I wake up to get my cake up I'm out to grind
They threw me in the game
I got my eyes open tough luck for ya'll
Put em up This the biggest street anthem in the hood right now
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
You got enough to eat
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
In a all black Impala
You niggas on the bench
Throw that ass back, bouquet
Hoppin' out dat Chevy on 28's, I'm dodgin' power lines
God bless you all, I only talk special talk
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Eh yup, that'd be the day you wanna kill a nigga
If anybody got a problem I just tell 'em to get on their grind
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
I stay down from day one so I say fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas (Let's go)
Patek drippin', Hublot drippin'
I done iced out my charms
So if you want it
Got the Mansion on the island
That's a bullet hole, it is not a tumor
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary
Didi didi didi di hazine di ouah
One hit, one breath away
It's important to stay strong
I feel it in the air and i'm order for them [Chorus:]
We worked hard, and now they call us bosses And I done seen so many people slow down
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
I stay down from day one so I say fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Too many times and bitch I ain't got time How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
Hustle like I still pay rent man
And every nigga in the squad gon' keep it 100
You risk it err'day and night [Chorus]
Diamonds, look like they glowing
Makin' money ain't shit to me
If you've been working hard
You gon' have me flying in and out of town
DJ Khaled! A divine leader
You made me drown in it, oh touche, baby
How I woulda make it through ooh
Bag alert, major bag alert, yeah (bag)
Swear you haters couldn't see me if I glowed in the dark
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
And your pussy on agua
So wear ya vest's and I'm still gon' stunt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Ride out, 'cause I'm runnin' the South
Well here's a sip of aquafina
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
I put some ice on my arms (woo!)
Haters got nothing on me
I'm on my way-ay-ay-ay DJ Khaled! I wanna say thank you for the time and the love you share
I got stank up in my swisher, my bitch pussy smell like roses
It's like f*** life
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
The murder rate going up nigga, I done ran this check up nigga
Can you see it?
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Flip em and we bust em, then we ship 'em off
If you ungrateful then you ain't great
stacks and then countin' em
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
Buy her everything and I got proof
I'm on
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
We throw our money round here, but y'all can Welcome to my hood
Ball Greezy gettin' money like ya 'posed to

If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
Me and my daddy taking over
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!
Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happens to
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw The illest nigga know this, the king has spoken
This that fuck you in the air, no service dick
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Resort to violent reactions, that's childish
I think that she's a strip
It's mine forever we grind together
Carbon one-five
DJ Khaled It's just the way it is, oh
A wise speaker, a woman pleaser
I'mma treat you like the fetty
I even taught her how to turn to pot
Got my bands up, thanks to the transporter
Ace Hood got these rap niggas petro
Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind? You know, you know, you know, you know
You need to wake up and realize It was all a dream yeah homey I am on my job

Down to die for my survival

Yea I'm knocking on the banks door
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit
When I'm around they both get poppin'
'Cause I
Hold up my bust down I'm proving a point
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
Major Key, special cloth I go on and on
Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
My chariot is McLaren
Why complain on easy streets?
Open up the bank bitch, bring em large
Talkin' 'bout you (nobody knows) The season has returned
Better get out the way, you ain't ever seen real gorilla
And yeah I rep my city, bitch
Like it's no other option
Pull up and spread my wings
O-V-O sound man I'm proud of my niggas,
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Better make a smile when you see that bitch pull up (pull up) Money don't make me happy (Make me happy)
I know you got some fight in you, oh
My youngins and we
We fed up (we the best)
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous
Girl you make a mess
You're a icon, you're a legend
Niggas be copying the swag alert
Touchin', kissin', and lickin'
(Give me all of you or all of me)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
We are alive Power, paper, palace is so high
And you drink for a reason
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
I got my foot in the door but still hustlin' for more
The winner I represent the ghetto across the world
I got the dopest flow and they seen it
How I measure my woman
I'm talkin' Norieaga, nigga, the real Norieaga
That's the sound of the police in my hood Bitch I'm on probation, so my nerves bad
And then she Take it to the head
From the bottom to the top only Lord knows Man I'm so blessed (I'm so blessed)
WOOOO CHORUS SEAN PAUL VERSE SEAN PAUL: Become in love dem ott gurls
Used to make the wrong choices along the way
I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards
And you can't take that away from me (Its Ricky Ross)
Slowin' me down
When I try to think, it just race
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody but you
You mesmerized by the flying sky
When I get like this I can't be around you
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Parking lot look like a film, yeah
Get around town in a private Lear

When they told me, "Don't matter, boss won"
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through I'm what it is i'm Macdola hype with a game to back
Look like such a winner
It's all different hustle (straight up)
Yeah leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leaving
And climb up your chest, nigga, motherfuck your vest, nigga
Had to dodge a few obstacles, dodge a few rounds
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
If it wasn't for your love

And the niggas that's next to me it's all the niggas that stress with me
Still put in the work that I needed
I'm big like Diddy damn it, I'm wit' it
I had to ice out my arms (ice)
My money is longer, but my weed is stronger
Some of 'em did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
