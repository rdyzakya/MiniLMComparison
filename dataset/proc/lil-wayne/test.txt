Running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune

Shake and bake ricky bobby
On the road to redemption go on and use a few stairs
But I tried to talk to him but then a nigga had to
Big wheels make it look a lil bulky
Got cribs cars bikes dykes Believe that daddy
Handle it like a standard

Lord Im ballin like a hot boy hot boy hot boy hot boy free that Hot Boy
But I dont trust dudes like a prenup
Straight frowns no daps strapped three times
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees

And I dont play with them at all so I dont say its a game
Im like a linebacker dont run it by me
Hey yeah

You say Im bad you probably right
And Im in it like Bennett hoe arent I cool
