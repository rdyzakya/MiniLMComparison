And you didn't even get no taste
Tempted to work When I walk in your shoes
Baby come here, don't have no fear
No tears for us (no tears for us)
I never saw you, I only heard of you
It's been a long day Recently my head
Darling I need you
In the night, in the night
I think I love you The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
In a phrase how i feel Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
There's nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
In the studio I will finally burn
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
But right now I got stuff to do Try to put me in a room, distraction less
I should take in college now
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy He said 'the respect I made you earn -
Says that love is blind
So he tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her, 'cause of what's inside her it never dies
With ten thousand people watching
But I'm not always forward thinkin'
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
Now I can't work like this with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
The sky above ablaze He walks away
Remember when we were together
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem
I cheated myself
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
Jazz 'n blues (jazz and blues).
Otherwise mines a different way
I'm staying busy
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
When you smoke all my weed man
I feel the way your soul does there Darling they empathize
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Tonight you're mine, completely
But every moment we could snatch
'Cause the music is a gift
But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
To my monogram
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You've got the degree in philosophy
I've had in mind Looking everywhere
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
You should thank your lucky stars
You can try to stop me now
And you dressed like a star
I miss him most of all when it got late
With your big empty purse
Bill and coo when they love?
He really knows how to cry
Never miss a night
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
Wheres my morel parallel
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And I do I don't catch your drift and I don't catch your plan
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
In all the world, it's true
When there's so many bigger things at hand?
Sleep too late
That I could fall back into bed Chorus:
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good I never wanted you to be my man
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
I would be behind him
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams You were a rich girl, and only having fun
But my
Wheres my morel parallel Creative energy abused
Masculine he spins a spell
And you get yours Once is enough to make me attack
I won't go, go, go Well sometimes I go out by myself
I needed it as much as you did Now its not hard to understand
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you I know your image of me is what I hope to be
But what's inside her never dies Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
My tears dry on their own I don't understand
Cant help
I know that I could shut you down again
Is to be a footballers wife.
Time to think it through
Just take it
Bye, bye now
Even if I stop wanting you,
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
And we'll have everything
So tell me why you think that's a crime I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Always be good
So if I got it I will spend it all,
I gotta know you now and then I gotta know you now
I'll take you out shoppin',
B boy, be my baby (won't you be my baby)
Justice done
That's what you say-a,
You gots to call the green man
I told ya I was troubled
My tears dry on their own Whoa, he walks away
Still we're often told
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
I cannot forget
You don't like players,
Why we just speak at night
With your Gucci bag crew
You know what all my faces mean
When I clock black hair blue eyes
He said, I just think you're depressed
I'm sitting on the royal flush
And for your own sake
Wheres my morel parallel Nobody stands in between me and my man it's me and Mr Jones
All I need is for my man to live up to his role,
Because we are best friends right? My heart is sad and lonely
There must have been but I don't care
But I had a taste of you
Its a necessity just like it was before
A certain lad
Yeah (me and Mr. Jones) (me and Mr. Jones) There's a saying old
Will you still love me tomorrow I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
And old midnight knows it too When some quarrel we had needs mending
See it from a different view
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
And never known what love's about
When your shit works
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
And that's you whole claim to fame
You always want to talk it through, I'm okay
I sleep alone the sun comes up
But that part never goes right In the morning you're vexed
'Round midnight
They don't do nothing for ya,
And when Frank Sinatra sings
Lookin' for a man,
So I sing the standard shit
But you won't get the chance Half time
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Just friends?
We may never meet again
Her soul is taken
And this isn't yet the day I can't help you if you won't help yourself
But you were in the shower when I got there
No he wasn't you
That you always get dumped
Always have to comfort you every day,
But I should care and I do (brief instrumental interlude) I should care but it just doesn't get me
When you are at a age now well life turns around
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule Maybe we could talk 'bout things
Some kind of laid back feeling
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
It's always dangerous
Well my body's been a mess
Oh, how I need
And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets,
I said, "no, no, no"
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
I gotta know you now and then Oh, I'm not ruling you out
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Not an excuse oh
My tears dry on their own I wish I could sing no regrets
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah I gotta know you now
I'll be what you make me, my darling Oh baby, you make me feel so good
There's danger of me losing all my happiness.
But I heard love is blind Tonight you're mine, completely
It ain't recharged as such
Jazz 'n blues. Standin' too deep at the bar today,
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Can we be alone? When will we get
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
And hope that your dreams will come true And then while I'm away
Haven't found him yet
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Mister Magic
And my thighs ache again Last night tips into my mind
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone
I should care, I should go without sleeping
I'll never let myself forget you
You know that I'm no good
And when I'm done I'm gonna do it again
I'll be some next man's other woman soon, I shouldn't play myself again,
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him)
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Just friends? It's never safe for us
There's no one more important to me
There is nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
'Cause I've been drinking
Consider the change Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Tell me
Now take it
You should have known from the jump
It depends on what I've been drinkin' Cause everything I do or say
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay? I've forgotten all of young love's joy
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place How do I find words that do not condescend
But you're one of a kind
And now..my mind..is workin' overtime
And your lucky its ladies night. With your big empty purse,
Jazz 'n blues. Tall and tanned and young and lovely
Wheres my morel parallel I can't wait to get away from you
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Act like we can rekindle that flame
And you know my friends So maybe you will get my number
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
Huggin' up the big monkey man It's your lie, it's your lie
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
But then I count my sheep well
You did too much E
Someone to watch over me When will we get
You'll follow your heart I know
And I'm so tired
And now little rich girl, I wrote this song
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men, He walks away,
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
You love blow, and I love puff
So far removed from all that we went through
Just can't live my life without you
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
I think he'd wear me well
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
Who'll watch over me Although he may
Each man she passes
And it's stronger than all else
So he tries to pacify her
In demand by all the ladies
And you always give me stress free point of view
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be And although my pride's not easily disturbed
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
And when there's no place for you to turn
And are you shopping anywhere,
You need your nerve to hide your ego, don't come with that
So I'm holding my hand in his
And sleep can only cure, yeah
And it overpowers me
Than what I feel for you If my man was fighting
It looks like the ending
Tomorrow I'll miss you
To my heart
That's what you say-a
Someone to watch over me Won't you tell him please
But every moment we could snatch,
Take the box
The only time I hold your hand
You was born wide
Huggin' up the big monkey man Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I just wanna rip your body over mine
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
In this blue shade,
In the studio, I would finally burn
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I could cut you down again
So long, so long, so loooooooooong Mmm yeah
Soaked in soul
I can't even cry Relationship doesn't remain
That you always get dumped,
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
(What do you want) To hold your head above the sea
But the show is so unprepared now My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Every time his shoulders flex
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Now everywhere I got and I always stare
Every week it gets worse,
Oh, oh, no Cant help
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee yeah yeah
Layin' me out to rest
Gone to find her big blue jay
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
And in this grey, in this blue shade
I'd rather have myself and smoke my homegrown
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Play with fire till your fingers burn
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
Not be the man some
I've acted out my love in stages
How you feel inside
Like a queen with her king
And I wake up alone If I was my heart
If you were like all other men
And my tears dry
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
You say I always get my own way
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
History repeats itself, it fails to die
So hang up for your trying cards, please (he's my baby) Love-sick calls, that's what I get
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
With his same old safe bet
But the guilt will kill you
And I go back to black You should be stronger than me
Valerie
I wouldn't care if brave would give me some more
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
I've got no reason to smile Judy and johnny just walked through that door
Pour myself over him
Hand me your Stella and fly
My deep shade,
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
I said, no, no, no
Than what you bring to me
We wait for the blow Put it in writing
I go back to
Pick you up after school Mister Magic, take a token
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
By the next time I'm in town I can't help, it need to stop it
I don't have a key for downstairs
With strength he didn't know
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
'Cause you got there for free
We only communicate when we need to fight
My guitar to London town
Take the box Take the box I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I always have to comfort you every day
I just, oh, I just need a friend
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
Love is a fate resigned
Who's playing Saturday? What kind of fuckery are you?
So when will you learn
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall. I cross my fingers at the cash machine,
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red And now I feel so small discovering you knew
Love is a losing game
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
Let me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
But I should care and I do And I do I would die before I divorce you
I stay up, clean the house
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
Is to love love love him
With your Gucci bag crew,
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
But I could swear that we were through
Five story fire as you came
You shrug, and it's the worst
And let your arrow flow.
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
So with your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
There's so much that I could never say to your face
I cannot play my self again
Come and put our two hearts together
I know I could
And this regret I had to get accustomed to,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
When will we get
And I look across the water
All the while you will see my songs of praise
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. You don't like ballers,
And the way you like to dress
The way the shirt hangs off his back
Cause Im the shit I earn I cant look for my sins
Really I finally talk
Like your forgetting all the good shit
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
I'm longin' to see
Thought you had so many lessons to learn'
To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans. Chorus: (x2)
She understands me after eighteen years
There's music all around me
And added to that Im sick of having to seek some peace
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight I'm confused and quizzical
Someone to watch over me I'm a little lamb
Mister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear
I reach over for you
That would make me strong and brave
Although I've been here before Amy Amy Amy
You know I'm yours for just the taking
You should be stronger than me They tried to make me go to rehab
Have everyone think I'm on the mend And it's not just my pride
And it's okay,
I'll go back to black We only said goodbye with words
I drift off I fantasize Amy Amy Amy
But you end up with one-night-stands
They don't do nothing for ya
He takes the day but I'm grown,
Everything falls into place
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go The man said, "why do you think you here?
Let the angels sing
But I know we don't come in a shot glass They tried to make me go to rehab
Or them big baller
Cupid help me if you will So Cupid, draw back your bow.
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Without you I'm misery
Can't tell who he's lookin' to 'Cause you all look the same
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
when I could sleep instead
So next time that they row She throws it out
Separate sex with emotion
My one and only baby (Oh, oh, oh, oh) It was winnin' time, you know what they say
The jack of hearts is my jackpot Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
I knew I hadn't met my match,
Stop making a fool out of me
(Yeah I'm so young)
Don't overreact ' I pretended he was you
Then go home and catch the chips you got
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy He said "the respect I made you earn
'Side from Sammy, you're my best black Jew
Did you think about us, did you miss your baby?
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
I stand before him (before him, I)
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy Today my bird flew away
Our day will come (our day will come, our day will come) Our dreams have magic because we'll always stay in love this way
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And I'm so tired I cant even cry I don't know you anymore
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
But when you need more than company
He could be your whole life
And get a release from this awful misery What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
And I know you you're so frustrated
And you still don't see me like you ought to do Maybe we could talk 'bout things
I always get what I want
Yes it's fools gold Every day I see you
That he was meant just for me, oh oh oh oh To know know know him
'Cause you jeans are too tight
Don't you know you supposed to be the man,
When we were at our height
The lights are on, but no one's home
From the picture my mind drew
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy, You should be stronger than me,
But I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
My blue shade
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
Why're you so upset?
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Swing back and forth
Some natural vibe
Feel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you
So I don't wanna tell you anything
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
And I'll understand if you go So
And because I can only take a full time man so much
No greater love
It goes to the last girl he hit [Chorus] So take the gold you find
I'm tighter than airport security team When you smoke all my weed man
When everybody's sleeping
Tell you what, my advance is comin' through,
When there's so many better things at hand,
My train of thought spins right off track Amy Amy Amy
Pull yourself together, do it soon
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Think love and wear a smile Our dreams have magic because we'll always stay in love this way
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And this regret I got accustomed to
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
I don't know why I got so attached,
But you end up with one-nights-stands. He could be your whole life,
Your just to hard to ignore
And I'm out of my mind Let our love take wing some midnight
'Cause your dream in life
With your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
I drip for him tonight
All my lyrics go unused
And I wake up alone
It's been a long long long day
He swims in my eyes by the bed
I ain't got seventy days
I don't know why I got so attached
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
Straight shook up beside him
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
I just wan get physical
Strangely enough, I sleep well
We're like how we were again
Knowin' when that is
Recognize my every sound
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved Simple sweet guitar
'Cause what's inside her never dies Even if she's content in his warmth
It's fools gold
He thinks, What's she running from? Now, how can he have her heart
Cause you're pushing thirty,
Just friends, just friends? Just friends Tell your boyfriend next time he around
Ooh, all my loving, all my loving, I will send to you Her name is Cherry, we've just met
Build your dreams to the stars above
That you got a man but I gots to burn
But it really gets bad 'round midnight Memories always start 'round midnight
'Cause you're pushing thirty
Starlight before she took flight
I might let you make it up to me, who's playing Saturday What kind of fuckery are you? Besides from some of you being my best black Joe
And I'm so tired I can't even cry All I can ever be to you,
I think you'd wear me well
But we are best friends...right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
Oh what a birthday surprise
And no emotional debt
If you got past one night
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
And this you can fix. Cupid, draw back your bow.
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be Although my pride, yeah, is not easily disturbed
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
But I said, no, no, no
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
My tears dry For you I was the flame
Now you don't want me in the flat
A different way from where I'm going
Now if there's a cloud up above us
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Where is the shepherd
Cause you got there for free,
Not in the morning
But we are best friends right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
And I'm so tired I cant even cry Mr Ultra sensitive
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Whoa, oh
Don't do nothing for ya.
Yeah I can get mine and you get yours Our day will come (our day will come)
Your priority, it must be heard
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I'll never love you like her
But I couldn't let it be
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
Get on without my guy
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
Love is a losing hand Though I battled blind
Four white Russians a JD and Coke, Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.
Nothing, no
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Your shadow covers me
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Huggin' up the big monkey man Now I know that, now I understand
'Cause as we kissed goodbye, the sun sets
How much more torture would you have put me through?
Burn the tip to get you through Mister Magic, take a token
It pacifies my ache Half time
My brother Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Yes, I been black
B boy, be my baby (be my baby now)
I would finally burn
I can't believe you played yourself like this Who loves one thing but come Brixton
La la la la la la la
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today
Moon spilling in
Even if I stop wanting you
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
What kind of fuckery are we? Nowadays you don't mean dick to me
There's nothing he won't try
But I never hated myself for my age so much yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
Oh, what a mess we made
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside We only said goodbye with words
His eyes were like yours
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
It's not enough
(All the time is all you got)
Can't tell who he's lookin' to. Cause you all look the same,
I will when I have so much sun CHORUS:
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
When she bore you before me
Met somebody
Kept his dick wet
But that part never goes right. In the morning you're vexed,
We're like two stars in the sky You are my rainy day, sunshine
Masculin you spin a spell
And I'm diggin' myself into a hole
We'll share the joy (we'll share the joy)
When it got stole?
It's plain to see
All my loving, darling I'll be true Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
So won't you please [Chorus x2] Make a name for myself in different ways
Don't be too upset
A good place to use a lovin' state of mind
He's just to hard to ignore
Such a funny thing but every time your near me
You don't like ballers
And Cherry is her name And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And less I could have one more chance to prove, dear My life a wreck you're making
That only lovers see He walks away
But will my heart be broken
And when it's over I'ma pull you closer
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips I'm confused and quizzical
'Fore it gets worse
I can't help but dance
Be slight nobody can be that wise I can't help you if you won't help yourself
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
Can't believe you played me out like that (ah) No, you ain't worth guest list
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally Mister Magic, take a token
And Ava flies in paradise With dread I woke in my bed
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
My tears dry on their own, So we are history,
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
I love you so (love you so)
But Judy left the same time
And I go back to
Frank's in there and I don't care
You never know what he'll do next, he's my baby My rainy days, my sunshine
No sweeter song
There's enough resentment in the air
I can't believe you played me out like that No you ain't worth guest lists plus one of all them girls you kissed
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him
It's not a good fit
B, I would have died too
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Till the chips were down
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed You don't like players
There'd be no fun,
So I got me a new best friend
I refuse to let him go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
But leave me alone for a while
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
In my bed, my bed, my bed I never thought my memory
Our day will come Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Want the same thing where we lay
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
Sung for my Ava every night Ava was the morning, now she's gone
My tears dry She sits home and dreams
Oh, whoa, oh He can only hold her for so long
Straight to my lovers heart, for me. I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress.
Memories mar my mind
You are like nothing that I ever knew I've been so many places in my life and time
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home,
Yours is a familiar face
('Cause you so smart)
So what do you expect from me
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Even if she's contenting his wants, she is played with urgency
This, me, yeah, baby, and the rest They tried to make me go to rehab
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller. You're more than a fan,
My tears dry on their own, I don't understand,
Now, how can he have a heart? When it got stole
Bill and coo, when they love?
And your priority, it must be heard Build your dreams to the stars above
For me it ain't real
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
And wasting her time
I don't hear everything I'm told He won't change her life
You give your soul so sweetly
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
But she will be waiting years for her wedding [Chorus]
How blind here he be?
We only said goodbye with words
And that's you whole claim to fame. Never miss a night,
Not fuck my self in the head with stupid men He walks away
So sorry if I turn my head
In the studio I would finally burn
Oh, Cupid.
James Moody would you come on hit me,
Once it was so right,
Everything is slowing down
If my man was fighting
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me To know know know him
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
He can't lose with me in tow
I'd have liked to
I still wonder about the things you do Mr Destiny lying infinitely, nobody stands in between me and my man
So won't you please [Chorus] Put two in the air if you feel like me
If you got past one night,
'Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
We could've never had it all
The melody it feeds my soul
Didn't think you get my number down as such
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Keep your Nikes on, you know how we do
Just friends? And, no, I'm not ashamed
To shooting pains up in my head
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Not even in the evening
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep So I should care, I should let it upset me
And carry you even though you're bigger
My heat in the cold of Winter
My hands were made for you
And wondering why it's me you're (ogling) I tell you I mean it
Oh, just let it ride
My blood running cold
My deep shade
You can't keep lying to yourself like this
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
And you dressed like a star,
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
All because we're in love Lullaby, lullaby Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Will you still love me tomorrow
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Never lasts me long (long),
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
(You won't help yourself)
My education is dragging, dragging
To just do this shit together
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed When you walk in the bar
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey,
The second I stop, the sleep catches up
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good Got back together with my man last night
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty
My frustration is released but nothing let em know
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast I cheated myself
Mister Magic
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
We resonate on different flames
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I'ma catch the train, guess I'm headin' your way
From the side he pulls my hair. Amy Amy Amy
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
I can't even remember his name
I said, I got no idea.
And the men notice you
So I'll call you cause that's OK We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
He takes the day, but I'm grown
I ain't got the time
Are you pretending
Oooooh, yeah [Chorus x2:]
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
And I know as my heart beats
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You're more than a fan
But he looked like you; I guess he looked like you
Love is a losing hand
And thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did)
No she doesn't see
So when the beat kicks in
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
My alibi for taking your guy
And so although I always look I know that I cant touch
I left my coat behind I can't help it, need to stop it
Always hear, when you sigh,
'Cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her
We were alone and I was singing this song for you Understand once he was a family man
When old midnight comes around Let our love take wing some midnight
Late - ely my energy's just drained away
It's too much to take
I cant help but bring it up, no
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
There's a winning secret to both
Straight to my lovers heart, hold me Now if your arrow makes his love strong for me.
Valerie Why don't come over Valerie? Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
There's no nightlife
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I wake up and de-stress
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
Why'd you always put me in control
'Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
And take a bad beat to ooh to boat oh!
I swear I'm gonna love him 'til eternity.
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Huggin' up the big monkey man La la la la la la la
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
And you love me Our day will come (our day will come)
You can blow now if you want to, I'm through Nobody stands in between me and my man
Huggin' up the big monkey man I never saw you, I only heard of you
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
Nobody but me.
Met somebody,
I go back to We only said goodbye with words
A restless mind so much Chorus:
Underwhere peeks at the top
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
I thought I didn't love you when I did
In that new promised land Maybe there we can find
There too many fools sold
I gotta know you now and then My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
What kind of fuckery is this? You made me Mr Slick Ricky
Rockin' your F me pumps. And the men notice you,
Though I can talk it through
Out to be
When you?re home at night
Of as handsome
It's my responsibility
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
My tears dry on their own He walks away,
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Your neighbors were screaming
Straight to my lovers heart, for me Yeah, Cupid.
There'd be no fun
I walk past his desk in heels
Now I know that, now I understand
You might think I've gone too far
The man that he longs to be Now, how can he have her heart
Someone to watch over me
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
I'll battle till this bitter finale
You go back to her
Consider the change My lyrics revealing
I love a man who doesn't know I exist.
Because I need emotion with my physical release Cant help
River of no return
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good It's like he was designed with me in mind
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
A perspective pushes through,
I'm really feeling in the mood for love So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
Women drink him in, swimming in his green eyes
Our mother
And in your way
That you turn away romance
He's onto the next,
You came out in front and I was hiding
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, whoa, whoa If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
Tempted to work Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Let our love be safe and sound
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
Thinking of you in the final throes
I never wanted you, many times when I tried to set you right, it's just too hard
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
You would cry too if it's happened to you
Love is a losing hand Self-professed profound
I'll let you know where you should stop
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
(Keep you high and dry)
My tears dry on their own He walks away
For this lost lamb? There's a somebody
'Cause we'll never be the way we were (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
Lately I've forgotten who I am
She looks straight ahead not at he Tall and tanned and young and lovely
Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah. Chorus:
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh And now I feel so small discovering you knew
The sky above,
And your old tricks no longer work
Why do I stress the man
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
And no emotional debts,
Just to see that smile
Huggin' up the big monkey man There is no greater love
For your returning
You decide what's wrong with me
He smiles
I can't believe it
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do Mr. Destiny, nine and fourteen
Unfamiliar surroundings
When he comes to me
Me and my head high
Everyone knows your name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
And I wake up alone Tonight you're mine, completely
I go back to us I love you much
Take the box Oh, lullaby by birdland that's what i
Waiting for you in the hotel at night,
And spent the night getting cane Without girls like you
And the thing that wakes me
Why was he holding her hand
But who you dying for?
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
And animal agression is my downfall
And now my mind is workin' overtime
That when she passes
I cant help, no, no
So subconsciously on purpose
We had to hit a wall
I'm all for you body and soul
Straight to my lovers heart for me.
It's been a loooong day
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
The sun goes down
As you were I gotta know you now
Searching kisses
But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you,
But she doesn't see
Won't you come on over
Tempted to work Distraction less
Knows what I want, then he'll fetch
Handle finance wrong (wrong),
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair
But to walk away, I have no capacity He walks away
A nightingale no longer singing Its something I know you can't do
That silent sense of content
When my heart is still with you
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear It's always gone within two days.
Make your mark for your friends to see
I tell you what you want to hear
So this is inevitable withdrawal,
He's onto the next
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
The tune tears me apart
Won't you be my king? (won't you be my king?) 'Cause I know you care, I'll dirty dance for you
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Just friends, just friends? When will we get
It's been a looooooooooooooong day
Come let us visit out there
You don't owe nothing to me
Without girls like you
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I'm not use to this,no no, I observe, I don't chase
She just stopped singing Ava was the morning, now she's gone
I'll bring joy to him oh oh
I never wanted you to be my man but I really couldn't control myself I can't wait to get away from you
'Cause we'll never be the way we were She can't always be there just to hold you down
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
Such a long day, ...ay, ay mmm
I knew I hadn't met my match
Its not that we grew apart
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Birds surround her sweet sound
Than what I feel for you
Every week it gets worse
And now the final frame
And when she passes
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure And anyway we're still so young
Once it was so right
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
My weakness from the other sex
And laughed at by the gods
Humbled by the bass
I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
He's the big affair
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath You're just a little boy underneath that hat
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar Wish I could say it breaks my heart
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
So just lately
Mm mm, Cupid. When you walk in the bar,
This little dream might fade away
You're out of my arms
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
How can he tell her he loves her
All my loving, darling I'll be true
And you didn't even get no taste. Don't be too upset,
'Cause this ache in my chest
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
But when you need someone to love
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came What do you expect?
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Just so right for me
You think everything is handed to you free
Is to be a footballer's wife You don't like players
And I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too.
Than what you sing, sing to me You're the sweetest thing
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
Follow my lead
Huggin' up the big monkey man
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans
One leg resting on the chair
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
Yet you know that I'm no good Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair! 'cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy,
My head is spinning My girl tried to stop me
Tell you baby, you huggin' up the big monkey man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones I can see you ahead of me
Someday he'll see
Reciting, my stomach standing still
Tempted to work Put me in a room, distraction less
Mister Magic, of my love
Late - ely, my energy's just drained away
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
We had to hit a wall,
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb, yeah
It's been a long day
And now just take the box
Why'd you always put me in control?
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
It's just till these tears have dried They tried to make me go to rehab
I always used to let you say But now I like to think out loud
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
I just don't know you
At least your breasts cost more than hers. So you did Miami,
Consider the change
But my friend, but my friend I don't know you anymore
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
I dunno how to turn you down And you're so thick and my patience thin
A beautiful thing taking you away
There's no nightlife,
I could be crying and you don't care
'cept for a dream or two
I gotta show you now and them
And now I reached a point where I dont care anymore
Messed each other up you know
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You might be twenty-five but in my mind
It's hard to conceive it
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too I hate my alcoholic logic
Your still clinging to that notion Every thing is slowing down
She's so vacant
My tears dry on their own, I wish I could say no regrets,
Why do I stress a man,
And surprisingly you hate me too
If you come between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away,
And life is like a pipe
We both know what it is Now-a-days we talk too much
Will you still love me tomorrow There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
I'll write home every day
"Seek and ye shall find"
But that don't make your place safe
While I love her every sound
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
Five hours
It's for security
Tell you baby, you huggin' up the big monkey man I never saw you, I only heard of you
Goes Aaah! Oh but he watches so sadly
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
I said "You don't know what love is get a grip
Or just a moment's pleasure
Is the thought that to deny?
I should just be my own best friend,
Responsibility comes down to you
And I'll send all my loving to you I'll pretend that I'm kissing
Love is a losing game Played out by the band
All because we're in love I should care, I should go around weeping
I'd rather be restless
And it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see, He walks away,
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
If she don't first
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
Only man I ever think
Makes it hard for you to stay
Always wanna talk it through- I'm ok,
If they call you a skank
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Or ask them when I'm ached down
It's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery is this?
Masculine you spin a spell
Got so sick of crying
So this is inevitable withdrawal
And now my head's hurting
Like you did in the beginning
I didn't let him hold my hand
Never lasts me long,
(Everything is everything)
Your runnin' with some different crowd
And your attitude become a bore
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band For me it ain't real
At least I'm not drinking
I died a hundred times
Stuck it in my boxing glove
She is plagued with urgency
'Till johnny's dancing with me
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know I don't ever want to drink again
And it swallows me whole
And I must put that check in the bank Try to put me in a room, distraction less
'Cause anyone who will see us
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
He carries the key Won't you tell him please
So you think you're cleverer than me
But already she knows me better than you
And Ava flies in paradise It begins to tell 'round midnight
I should just be my own best friend
Everyone knows your name,
Is a love I can be sure of
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
He would just give his heart gladly But each day when she walks to the sea
I know between the both of us, his heart we can steal.
You been here 7 years longer than me
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
You know that I'm no good I cheated myself
And I will stand beside you
I spend my days in longin'
More than I could stand
Amy Amy Amy
You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch
The man she misses
He's not all he seems
All those men just go home to their wives Don't be mad at me
Cause like the news everyday you get pressed. You don't like players,
Just take it, take it
Go on and let in rain
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You can't sit down right
And now...my mind....is workin' overtime
Nobody stands in between me and my man
Why haven't you seen it
Someone who cares feels so freaky
All my loving, all my loving
As I write this on the train
But that just hurts When will we get
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
There'll be none of him no more
All those men just go home to their wives. Don't be mad at me,
Follow my father, his extravagant ways.
So I always keep a bottle near
And I've been thinking
I justify attraction by your hands, your lips, your hair
But somehow you missed the plane
By the time I'm out the door
When we were at our high,
She calls herself his wife
Handle finance wrong,
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Cause you jeans are too tight,
As I check my balance I kiss the screen.
