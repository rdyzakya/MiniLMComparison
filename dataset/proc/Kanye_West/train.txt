And Im a big tipper I dont need to be trippin
She had the maid outfit its all on her apron
Only problem is Im rich
And the lights even brighter baby stand next to my fire
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
To figure out RnB to get all of that
Stop your cryin baby

No sins as long as theres permission
Lookin at my closet wondering if its all about clothes
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Yall niggas stole the soul yall niggas all some clones
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
I thought I had a sign a Seal like Heidi Klum

So everybody know he love white people
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang

In this white man world we the ones chosen
They say Im crazy but thats the best thing goin for me
I know I know I shouldnt even bother
Wakin up on your sofa
From the bottom so the tops
I asked the nurse Did you do the research
Gnarly

Fly across the earth put things in reverse
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Funny how Im flyer than them all
Eating good vegetarian with the brown rice
Hundred dollar bill look at you look at you
Now lets go take em back to the plan
All that cocaine on the table you cant snort that
We believe in God but do God believe in us

Early morning cartoon shit black
You hope that he get what he deserves word
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
Im aware Im a wolf
He asked me about my Maybach think he had the same
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And from that point I never blow her off
But far as handlin all that ass I think you gon need some help
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
But then I blessed them with that Polo
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
Now if I fuck this model
They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella
Turn the corners in a foreign car
So basically you and your girl over
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
So to hell with all that rubbish
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
But they wasnt satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
You an actor you should be on Broadway nigga
Starting all that stunting is gonna ruin you
Niggas dont take shots at us that is only obvious
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell

Theres been an accident like GEICO
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
Chasing yall dreams and what youve got planned
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
If I lay you down on the mattress
I resurrected my gold Jesus of Nazareth
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Im aware Im a king
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
Im trippin this drink got me saying a lot
But watch who you bring home
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight

When I fight and you fight we dont fight fair
Let me help you with a plan

Puffing on a blunt until the B got me body

And spit refreshingly
When the pastor asked me why Im flashy

You wanna stay but you cant stay no more

Remember that last time in Mexico
To a restaurant upper echelon
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
I dont know whats better getting laid or getting paid
Something wrong I hold my head

Why everything that feel so good gotta be so wrong
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
Thats why Id rather spit something that got a purp
Hold up yeah born in Word
Whos there

Haters back down gotta be that steel
So I can be like Slick Rick and rule ya

We claim other people kids on our income tax
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Feeling on her ass feeling so upper class
We were never meant to be baby we just happened
When I go to work she gotta call it in
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
Im an asshole You niggas got jokes
You see I always loved that sense of humor
And Im still actin calm denamuhh
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Tell me whats next Alien sex
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
And they gon hate it and Im his favorite
And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
These niggas asswater get the Drano
Keep him away huh Something might happen
Nah man mad people was fronting
And at the airport they check all through my bag
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
One thing I gotta call out boy take a look at Fall Out Boy
A girlll run her mouth only out of spite
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
So you walk around like you dont know me
We picking up right where we left
Lifestyles of the broke and famous
Arlenis Sosa Selita Ebanks
And just imagine how my girl feel
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
You dont see that we hurt But still
That drunk and hot girl
These niggas read the pimp manual but I designed it
What the what the fuck right now
Truest girls get half naked every spring
He said I gave you a big dick so go extra hard
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
Wait could this be considered our first date
Everybody know I got it if you want it then get at it
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Nah nah nah
And I dont know if Ill be back again
But he just cant seem to get Kanye fresh
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
But they just not you
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
For that Jesus piece man Ive been saved nigga
And I know that the government administer AIDS
They say Im crazy but Im about to go dumb again
God sent me a message said Im too aggressive
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Every time magazines try to taint my name
No goodbyes
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
Everything we dreamed of
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
The smokescreens
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Some people call that the art of war you know
She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
My style so cold I could skate myself
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
I believe you like a fat trainer takin a bite or somethin
I unzip things and pull out big things
Seven oclock thats primetime
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
Woke up and felt the vibe whoo
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Except hes really putting it down
I done did shit on logical
Enter the kingdom black
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
We never gonna die
Ill fuck your Hampton spouse
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
Keep it on the roll only God knows
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
Yeah then me and wifey make a movie
Thought youd be different bout it
And yep Im still the future of the Chi
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And Im beasting off the Riesling
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
But in the end its still so lonely
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey Yo
Im Kanye not Kayne
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
People you never got a chance to say bye to
To Colette to get the new shit that Paris sell
He was with me when I was only imagining
Shits deeper than The Sleepers
You remind me of my old chick
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Hey chick what these doctors know anyway
But you shine so much they dont seem famous
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
And get her high
Outta the box reach for it through the threshold
With the top off lookin for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracee Rosss
But Im so bad
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
I just remembered that my limelight extrabright
stCentury schizoid man
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
King like TI but in the Chi Larry
Up late night like she on patrol
Fuck can she fuck right now
Its am and were just starting again
Im killin these niggas cant front nigga
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Roll up the doja Henny and CocaCola
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
You think you free but you a slave to the funds baby
Just cause he a nerd and you dont know what a condom is
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
But you play it off and say How is work baby
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
The next generation will be the real victims
I cant fault em really
When you go to sleep What do you think bout
Get they first car and then IRS show up
How I made the world bounce like
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Smooze amongst the Whos Whos

Cause we cant get along no resolution

You should be honored by my lateness
Sorry Im in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
They say because of the fame and stardom
I dreamt of Pac he asked me Are you still down
Bang bang bang bang bang

Though a freshman still the West man
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin

Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Before the limelight stole ya

Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
That hit the spot til she ask

One time for a nigga really gettin it
Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
When you never fuck with the lights on
Damn these niggas got me
Imma feel like an asshole
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
All that frontin for the audience
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more

Where restless niggas might snatch your necklace
And she respond YESSSIR
And this life too crazy to think logically
Kanye the best in the game now we got that that thing clear

Last week I was in my other other Benz

Billboard pop star neighborhood block star

Now you got your own money you dont need nobody else
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something

Shes coming over so I guess that means Im her drugs
Tell her everything gon be fine but I be lyin

Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
I gotta say whats up to Tony Williams
Last month I helped her with the car payment
One more hit and I can own ya
Like Jay keep Beyonce
Okay okay okay okay okay okay That part
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
I remember Rochelle aint wanna fuck me with the polo
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
When they taste level aint at my waist level
Only problem is I see they all want a ring ring
Now everybody is movin they body
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
Blame it on the pigment we living no limits
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Until that dayo she take the monorail
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
Why I made that bitch famous God damn
Sibling rivalry only I could see
Yo Kwe she dont believe me please pick up the line

And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
As soon as I did all the Bullshit was deaded
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you meet me in person what do you feel like

But yall cant hold me down like restraint
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
When I get on my Steve Jobs somebody gon get fired
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
Maybe its cause she into Leos and I was into trios
Told you four times dont test me hoe

Hard with all these girls just testing me
Just remember I made you like my Nike Air
We get racially profiled
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
Cars money girls and the clothes

Get arrested guess until he get the message
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
I know I seen you before but dont know where I seen ya
You know just what we want

Same as the legend was told
You mean Talib Lyrics sticks to your rib
Her allure is more couture tailormade
Peekin through the keyhole the door locked by myself
Reluctantly because most of this press dont fuck wit me
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
All that talkin I feed off of keep it up
All of which is legal in Amsterdam
Sorry Mr West theres no good classes and thats what yo ass get
The best living or dead hands down huh

Some rhyme with a name some rhyme nameless
Oh I see when they think a nigga is stupid rich
Ill be there in five minutes go head ride with it
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
Whatever comes first Im prepared for the worst
But still supported me when I did the opposite
I mean you demoralizing bitches with your style
I done played the underdog my whole career
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
Tyrone its been a year with no phone
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Who knew who knew

Theres a lot of stars in here aint it
Twisted love story True Romance

Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
But when Ali turn up and be Ali you cant ever change that nigga back to Cassius

My life is like a childs illusions become reality
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
And I bottled it up
So I can stay out of reach they used to say Youse a producer

But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
Yeah tonight I see some super freaky hoes
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Before you ask

So when you talk bout you know who I dont know who you talking bout
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
I was pretty before the dough but now Im just the man
New version of Pete Rock
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot

I know a lot of people mad cause they aint with you

Shes got a lover so the lies and the lust is a rush
The prettiest people do the ugliest things

When I park my Range Rover
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I mean Ill be your con man Ill be your damn liar
But first you gon remember how to forget
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian
And you pray to God she dont grow breasts too soon
Anything you heard happened yo it probably did
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Oragy or are we speaking metaphorically
Thats when you die hard
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club

Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
It wouldnt make me now feel so sick just because
Sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if
Come through ya block and air people
What Im dealing with is too real for me to comment on
That night that night that night
Feelin on a girls ass with a troubled past
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
Anything you mightve
Immature adult insecure asshole
Fucking with my clique
Living life like theres no damn rules
I couldnt tell you if Halles really real
So everybody else dont have to know
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
And Ive done fucked up so bad that I cant go home
And I just want my credit
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
Now drunk textin
Ooh girl your breath is harsh
Primetime basking in the lime
The good life it feel like Atlanta
Im so clean and them they got rabies
Yeahhh had to take it to another realm
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Im just saying how I feel man
Top MCs you gotta rewind me
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
They favorite Cent song Questions
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
And I dont even wanna hear bout what niggas might do
She find pictures in my email
You want a boss or an RB nigga with a six pack
Music and iPhone cameras
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
Without some Ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
Hopping out the van screams from the fans
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Chased the good life my whole life long
The best way that you know he best way that you know how
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
When I pulled up to the light
And I swear she a riot folks
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
This for my fam
Lookin out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Talked it then he lived it spit it then he shit it
Walkin livin breathin god you know my past well
And anything that happen is for a reason
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Ima just ride out with these
When you first stop caring about your appearance
Meanwhile she out doing the same thing now
She lookin for her daddy call me Big Poppa
The good life lets go on a living spree
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
You know what maybe youre right aight
Im finna take yall back to them better times
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool 
So I did what they aint expect from him
Grab your hand white dress you gon hop in too
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it
Now Im looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
You lose you lose
Im just always right
Pour a little champagne cranberry vodka
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
But Im not trying to cause commotion
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
Itll send her body into a seizure
Shy and all
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen
Man the drama is so enticing
I cant deny it Im a straight rider
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
If you aint with us you in our way nigga
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
And if I see Biggie tonight I loved every minute
I see its Dolce Gabbana
Piss in your grave piss in your grave
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Roll some think Ill roll some
This is the making of a masterpiece
Man the flow so cold chicken soup wont help
So they ask me why you call it Late Registration Ye
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
A lot of people say thats where Ye is
See Ive abducted you
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
We like the promised land of the OGs
But unless they use a strapon then they not dykes
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
We got something that we both gon like
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
Everybody lying on who I bang
And at this rate we gon both die broke
To all my second string bitches try and get a baby
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Why your team pissed like urine
About my vision
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Ask the city what they got for us
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Homie this shit is basic welcome to Graduation
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
These the last hours but superman late
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
But I cant take another minute of it at all
Armor All flow cause it never get rusty
Show me where they at
Its a hundred girls tryna get down down down
And I told you to wait
Dinner with Anna Wintour racing with Anja Rubik
So we can finally fly off into NASA
Sophisticated ignorance write my curses in cursive

Now who to blame you to blame me to blame

Yall finna see some dead people
Jessica Gomes yall I would damage her
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
But hey admittin is the first step
On the field Im overreckless on my Odell Beckham
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
While Im flying with a flow that is
Uhm well cutie I like your bougie booty
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
When you stop the programs for after school

And that American Apparel girl in just tights
He figured hed take work
And you was screamin that you love me
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
I got dogs thatll chew a fucking hole through the wall
Im about to hit the Ye button
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
Said he couldnt rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
I sold my soul to the devil
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
We never had nothin handed took nothin for granted
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
So go ahead and just pose

All my homies GDs but I am Lord
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me
And Im feelin it right now cause its the time when my heart got shot down

And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
She asked Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
Only Michael Richardson only much blacker
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up

Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
And I dont know about you now
Big pimpin like Jigga man

Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem

Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
Before I lose half of what I own
And the way I flew

Lets take em back to the club
More power to you more power to you my lovely one
Get it thats so impossible to get it Its impossible

Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
Especially if you ball
Times of the essence I need you to be spontaneous
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
Though the jewelrys Egyptian know the hungers Ethiopian
Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
Sunglasses and Advil

So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax

Back of my mind He could change your life
Dope as a mother fuckin acid trip
After I fuck the manager up
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
Its a war going on outside we aint safe from
My New York nigga said he heard it at sons house
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
To know that now its over
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
One hand up hold onto heaven
So when Im on vacay I need to kick back
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
Merry Christmas to all and all a good night

When I rock the stadium
Seven times in a row I could go the whole week
Im living three dreams Biggie Smalls Dr King
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
First I spin around and vomit then I shit up on it
Every time I see the news man it bring me home
Something strange is happenin

And Imma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
And a white man get paid off of all of that
In your milky way way
Let me see what we have tonight Im high as a satellite
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
Know you I know youve been goin through it your whole life
You get to flirtin play her just perfect
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert Yes Tell Howard Cosell
You really want to know about a day in that shit
At home supermodel myspaces
Everybody gon say something
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I know that Jesus died for us
Off and I took a recess
The beats slow til you listen to my pace
Pray for me
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
Shit these last years been a haze like Issac
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie
I know its past visiting hours
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
Rock Forever but just turned thirty
Hundred degrees drop the roof so the coupe dont melt
Get Olga Kurylenko tell her Im very single
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
When we tried our first molly
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more
Ey Hey yo Poppin willy shit
I must got a angel cause look how death missed his ass
Aye yo this mutherfuckas jammin Im on it its an anthem
A million out the door Im about to go H¬¨‚àëA¬¨‚àëM
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
If you call out my name then you know they gon go
But its am and we bout to go up again
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont worry about what we cant control
Tryin my luck I hit her with the text say
And pray that all of their pain be champagne
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
My dogg said you aint a freak so you gotta prove my man wrong
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
Your bitch got a bitch your spouse got another spouse
Really Doe got a different type of plastic on him
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
I aint ever been scurred
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
I aint tryin to hound you
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
Tryin to show yo legs off you aint Amerie
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
I dont give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
Tarantino Da Vinci getting Benjies get half off of Fendi
The Phillip Lim remind them that its Fashion Week
Nobody can tell me where Im headin
But I still talk that CAAASH cause a lot wags want to hear it
Jesus walks for them
To become the higher me
DC PG or ATL
Yall dont want no prob from me
Let it fall let it crash burn slow

Right now shed be okay But since she
The head still good though the head still good though
Okay look up now they done stoled yo streetness
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Ive been down this road too many times before
To bein the President look theres hope man

Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
But I feel I could convert her
And Im feeling like Mike at his Baddest
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Thats real love mmhmm ahhnah
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
She aint really bad she a photo thot
You should just go and throw a cape on
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
My outfit so disrespectful
Gone for eternity
She a pledge AKA she was pink and green

Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
You shortminded niggas thoughts is Napoleon

They be drug testin yo ass and then they pray you dont pass
They call me Edward Scissorhands cause Im trying to cut

All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid

Now ask yourself this question umm
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Real nigga back in the house again
And them ghetto bitches hollin How you do that
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
And if you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault
In the third grade
Heard Yeezy was racist well I guess thats on one basis
I feel like its still niggas that owe me checks
On I let my nightmares go
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
And Imma come and fix you up like the handyman
You know some other shit I hate wwwhat
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain

Of this mothafuckin dinner table
