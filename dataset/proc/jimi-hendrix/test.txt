Ah, drink up baby Been ridin' broomsticks since she was fifteen
Manic depression is catchin' my soul Woman so weary, the sweet cause in vain

Everything goin' to be alright
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually There was a young girl, who's heart was a frown

I heard you shot your old lady down
You better give it right
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea And then she spread her wings high over me

You'd better believe
But who in your measly little world
I got my wings to fly Yeah!
Yellow, red, and black of this

Reachin' up but not quite touching the promised land
His soul it has to roam
The magic carpet waits for you so don't you be late
I'll be with you when the stars start falling. I've been waiting so long
Floatin', hey, hey !
The days of ice

'Cause I'm a million miles away
Maybe tomorrow, I just can't tell you baby, but, uh
Find yourself first
Oh yeah
Well it's too bad
And that's the reason why she had to part
Come to face reality (it sounds like he says "fake reality") Forget about the past, baby
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam
"buddy miles is goin' to do something he wrote called 'them changes'." Well my mind is goin' through them changes

'Cause I'm a voodoo child
Girl, I'm fightin' this war for the children and you
CAN YOU SEE? ME BABY
Fishin' after me
Well, I just can't say

In the sunshine of your love. I'm with you my love,
The sky was filled with a thousand stars

You say your mum ain't home,
She had me had me had me cryin'
Stay up and straight ahead
(It's the eagle's wing, baby, what did I say?)
I ain't been home to see my baby
But sometimes I get a ha
I don't need to run over you
Morning sign sounds just like a lock
So lonely
If you look around you, you will see a few minds being blown
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
A woman, she claimed his name
Forever forever Oh say can you see it's really such a mess
Now this pastime gets everybody honest and straight
So I hope you save your love, baby
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep,
With the living and the dead...
A never to grow old. A there you were under the tree of song
A never to grow old. Golden rose, the color of the dream I had
Fly on my sweet, sweet angel
Hey ! hey !
Lonely Will I live tomorrow?
And they also said it's impossible
I'll give it right back to you one of these days
YOU CAN SEE IN THE FUTURE OF A THOUSAND YEARS CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Oh I don't mind, I don't mind uh ( Well all right... )
Lord, she gave me lovin both night and day

Stone crazy baby Solo Repeat first verse "lady's and gentlemen, the Jimi Hendrix experience." "I see that we meet again hmmm. yeah well, well, well. dig,
Yeah, they're talking about getting together, yeah
But uh since my baby left me he ain't sang a tune all day
Well, I have Let me prove it to you... Trumpets and violins I can hear in distance
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this:
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child
Talkin' about the clothes I wear
Yes he used to sing for his supper, babe
And now he stands outside
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad
And then your tool
and the sea is straight ahead, straight up ahead Well it's too bad that our friends, can't be with us today
(Yeah! What did I say now)
Let me stand next to your fire Manic depression is touching my soul
Princes kept the view
The name of the rising sun The story is written
You say you just want me to take you for a ride You're just like crosstown traffic
Make ev'ry body as happy as can be
That's my drink, man, that's my drink, alright...
Valleys of Neptune is rising, rising, rising Mercury liquid and emeralds shining
And of course this is why
i'm sitting up here." damn ooh "those people are lookin' at me too man"
I can dig it baby
So when they landed,
I know what I want but I just don't know
Or am I going blind ?
Rollin' down the highway
I'm sailing on a bluebird's mission
tears burnin' me in my soul
And I'm tryin' to get on the other side of town I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
You've got me floatin'
Well I picked them up, brushed them off,
Pass it on, pass it on to the young and old You got to tell the children the truth
to salute the last moment ever on dry land
