Flying
While he sings them of wars and wine
Since I heard that face to face
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
You and me, we're like America and Russia
Oh I'm like a black crow flying
Honey, tell them you've got germs
Acid, booze, and ass
Like a cactus tree
He aches and he learns to live
Red taillights on his hide
And nothing more than sayin' "i'm alive."
Hm hm hm, hm
For loving the freedom
He was thinking for himself
Water
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Milk of the Madonna
Shadows stretching
On your white-washed claim that
First he bought a '57 Biscayne
And I saw that ragged soul take flight
Amelia, it was just a false alarm Maybe I've never really loved
For worlds they can't share
The steeples lean
And wind in my hair
And their search for love that sticks around You've had lots of lovely women
When it strums the galaxy
Below my window
Oh come in, come in
The dance halls and cafes
Coward, slinking down the hall
And still feel so alone
In those days they put him in an
Sweet bird of time and change
He was walking along the road
Far from the overload Back at the bar
Kids with the jitters in their legs
He sees the cars as sets of waves
But I saw some crazy scenes
For what is this rough beast
The greed is the unraveling it's the unraveling
Hat tipped off to ladies
And you love your lovin'
Keeping away my blues He's my sunshine in the morning
Come in from the cold When I thought life had some meaning
The lights down there, that's where we'll land
I let him take me for a ride
Each new day is a kiss
Going cafe to cabaret
Like a wheel of fortune
No I won't cry for dreams that couldn't be
I well up with affection
From win and lose and still somehow
Do you really smile
And I might have stayed on with him there
Circled with compromise
Will you take me as I am?
The lights go down
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
Back to the garden Then can I walk beside you
He said I'd be better dead than live
His mother had the frailty
Shaking into town
From too much choice
The love's still flowing
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
I sat up all the night and watched thee
You're darn right
Went to a party down a red dirt road
I'd be nothing Love-never looks for love-
The time to watch the beast the best
On a yellow skateboard
Love is touching souls
And bully winds came around pushed them face down in the snow
Oh honey you turn me on I'm a radio
They say they're learning
It says "Pork Pie Hat Bar"
The spirit talks in spectrums
I catch my fool and my child
And the hissing of summer lawns
'Cause you lost your heart I went looking for a cause
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Tethered to a ringing telephone
Then she points a pistol through the door
And you couldn't see a city
Down the Champs Elysees
Or far from the barker's cry
Drinking up the band's beers
And worrying about the past
And the hands that cast wishes
And as, the smoke was clearing he said
Through stand-in boys and extra players
And the stars paid a light bill
I wanna fun, I wanna shine like the sun
Now today he's got a a quarter
But he left in time
Arm and arm went black and white
Soft voice whispers, "This can all be right
And a lampshade crown
"In France they kiss on Main Street"
I was raised on robbery We had a little money once
He still lives with his family
My darling dime store thief
Pale miners in their lantern rays
And he loved me so naughty
In this hitcher
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Life's too short, the whole thing's gotten
I've been traveling so long
Someone's hi-fi drumming Jelly Roll
While she's so busy being free I pulled up behind a Cadillac
You just picked up a hitcher
Looking for the key to set me free
Night ride home
They will lose her if they follow
To talk of castles in the sun Still I'll take a chance and see
Didn't it feel good
Smash our empty glasses down
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
That sunk like a stone
In morning, Morgantown Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Of the white lines on the free, free way It's coming on Christmas
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Black diamond earrings
Some by their own fathers
I'll show you my best recipe
We took a taxi to your mother's home
It stays pretty green
Charging, chanting down the jungle line There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
That nobody sits in
The critic!
The band tears down
I found someone to love today There's a sorrow in his eyes
He's a dancer in the dark
That don't seem to cease Look out the left the captain said
I knew I was a genius
Oh, and the tragedies in the nurseries
If your head says forget it
But the day she hits
That never blooms, come any spring
You can trick one off the corner
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
And you know there may be more
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail
Is we won't sell,
They said, How long can you hang around?
They just go underground
Looking and longing on the sly
But I in my leather and lace
God of delight
Gin's what I'm drinking
She says let me sit down
And we were walking down Main Street
There'll be sorrow Child with a child pretending
Thinking back down the roads to then
But till you get there yourself you never really know
She get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown
And a country road come off the wall
Government gave us three thousand dollars
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind I wish I had more sense of humor
There's always somebody calling you down I do my best
Love has no evil in mind If I had the gift of prophecy-
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel There's no comprehending
Just until my skin turns brown
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
A window full of colored rings
Under neon signs
Just gives you the blues
Because it rejoices in the truth
They're full of moon
Little, green, he's a non-comformer Just a little green
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Be your own best friend tonight
And a circus
Chasing dreams
We want the land!
If there's no good reception for me
Strung out on another man
the home of the brave and the free
Bashing in veins for peace
Or this baggage overload
Are happy and loud
Back to the garden By the time we got to Woodstock
And the song that he was playing
Fire and ice If your heart is on the floor
You spoke the fur and feather tongues,
And you both apologize
But clouds got in my way I've looked at clouds from both sides now
And the boards
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling Downtown
In the sticky middle of the night
Hear the hissing of summer lawns He put up a barbed wire fence
Crown and anchor me
Rocks pity me
It's been dirty for dirty
Or gliding like a swallow
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars
Saying, laughing and crying
Night ride home Although I speak in tongues
Sitting on my groceries
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey
Stretching on the forest floor
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain
See the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow
I'm in trouble 'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
Was just to come in from the cold (Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
As we rock between the sheets
And me in my frightened silence
Now the warriors of winter they gave a cold triumphant shout
There's a sun show every second Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
When the meadow grass was turning brown And summertime was falling down and winter was closing in
Lakota!
Love is gone
In this vigorous anonymity
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
I'm going to make a lot of money
The center cannot hold
He says "We walked on the moon
Don't get riled
Queen of Queens
Dragon shining with all values known
When I refused to ride
She could see the valley barbecues
Behind my bolt locked door
The best lack conviction
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have
At least better than I used to do A woman I knew just drowned herself
When you don't even try A strange boy is weaving
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?
He had those same eyes - just like yours
In the barrooms, poor drunk bastard falls
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
And put me at the top of your danger list
"You can't deny me
Orders from the king and queen Songs to aging children come
Fading in everyone's hand Give me some time
Still I'd be on my feet
I just get off up aways
And songs from the hit parade
All I really really want our love to do
Not a golden Prince who's come
And her blood-red fingernails Out of the fire and still smoldering
Get out of town. Well you came to new york city with a calendar full of gold
Waltzing on a ballroom girl You know it never has been easy
But lost in the moment
Cause you've just seen your lover
On a night ride home
And a family and a farm
But she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go
With the hole in her stocking Didn't it feel good
Wanna make you feel all free
Amelia, it was just a false alarm The drone of flying engines
In a blue sky I took a ferry to the highway
Keeping the sadness at bay
Keep your cool
We love our lovin' But not like we love our freedom
More about the war
I get so weak
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
Rock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory
Don't let up the sorrow
Like some surrealist
And a blood dimmed tide
You're under the thumb of the maid
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Night, night and day
I'm a wild wood flower Waving for you
Devil of cruelty
Uh come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
They've got a lot of style
It was plane to train my twin
i Still be on my feet Oh I am a lonely painter
Have names they must call me
And struggle in the darkness
But I said dear doctor
I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
In love with you Are you going to let me go there by myself
And hunger is human
When love makes a fool of me After the rush when you come back down
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
This 4th of July
Are all the mornings still to live
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and
Snake kite flying on a string." I come from open prairie
Up on your feathers laughing Golden in time
I fell into a dream
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
Who dives to the waters
And the rest you memorize
But he kept my camera to sell
I'm a runaway from the record biz
(Boring!)
You imitate the best
And we've got to get ourselves
That very good friend of mine
So you write him a letter, say, "her eyes are blue"
Remember this
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And I sketched your face on it twice Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
But you know I'll try to be there for you
Flirting and flirting Hurting too
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Take your time, it won't be long now
I am howling in the dark
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And all are fat and none are thin
All we can say with one whole heart
And I'm sending you out
You know it's the same release I told you when I met you
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
Buy your dreams a dollar down
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
You be polite."
And she's so busy being free There's a lady in the city
I'm a country station
In the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
They toss around your latest golden egg
And winter's closing in
Wondering who was there to hear
And humans are hungry
Through columbines and wizardry
But they seem so much confetti
Or lying there not talking
I'm headed to the church
I've witnessed thirty years We're only particles of change I know, I know
And I'll pad your purse-
And they charged all the people
You've finally got it made
So you ask the truck driver
Of picture-post-card-charms
From up and down, and still somehow
Turn this crazy bird around
If I didn't have love
And the wrath has finally taken form
Below my window Three waitresses all wearing
Up the charts
Eagles in the sky
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
But not like you love your freedom Help me
"Grow up!" I cried
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning I was driving across the burning desert
Concealed behind their rosaries
Skin white by skin golden
That's why I got into the vodka one night
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes and sometimes
She pulls the shade it's just another
Red dogs in debt to you I am Lakota!
And the streets are full of strangers
Little kids packin' guns to school
I've looked at love that way But now it's just another show
I'll ply the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin
You've got no one
They rain and snow on everyone
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
And it undoes all the joy that could be
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads In a highway service station
Behind our eyes
I may have been only three
Night ride home Round the curve
Anima rising
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
Don't it leave you on the empty side
Leave someone a letter
Subterranean by your own design
Hostage smile on presidents
When you're walking
And all I ever wanted
There's a lot of people asking for my time
While she was somewhere being free There's a man who's sent a letter
Under your dark glasses
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday
Others just come to harm
I've got beach tar on my feet
Reeling falcons Surely some revelation is at hand
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Cinematic lovers sway
I found someone to love today
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief
I made my baby say goodbye It's coming on Christmas
So this is how I hide the hurt
Not the early one
And trouble leaves too slow
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
The last laugh on you
We were sitting there talking
Love's a repetitious danger
Like fireworks in the sky
Underdog position
Put up a parking lot Rows and flows of angel hair
All for something lacy
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
They're trying to be a good friend of mine
That you're a wizard at three?
You loved the most
Sex kills All these jack-offs at the office
Bad news comes knocking
To Barangrill" Well some say it's in service
Massive mess we're in
Don't go yet
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
None of the crazy you get
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Call me at the station
And some saw red
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here. Oh, but California
The idiomatic logic
From her window sill
Sure it's stricken from your uniform
Crows and ravens whistling
With a blue bedspread
I don't want Nobody comin' over to my table
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles
Is keeping right alongside
Part of you pours out of me
I can't go back there anymore
So much could not be expressed
Let those rock 'n roll choir boys
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And I wound up fixing dinner
We had hope
I will bring you incense owls by night
For them and Boston Jim
(Fight to the light, fight to the light)
In living every day. I've looked at life from both sides now
And I made some value judgments
To lay down an impression
It's an old romance-the Boho dance
If you're driving into town
I get the urge for going but I never seem to go
For a slave to liberty
All of us woe-begotten-daughters
With the transistor going
I'm your biggest fan
Talking about zombies
And a taxi to a train
I just let things slide The station master's shuffling cards
And woke up vanishing Sweet bird you are
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas
Push your papers
A little passion
Above our nation
With an angel's love
You lay down your sneaking round the town, honey
And you want to stay still
And then I looked at myself here
Then her eye paint's running down
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
To say "I love you" right out loud
You're hoping it's near Folly
He hangs it up above the jungle line The jungle line, the jungle line
I could drink a case of you darling
She is another canyon lady Estrella circus girl
Does it really matter
He lies and he cheats
Perfumed rhapsodies to me Songs to aging children come
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe
Upon her small white bed
Stoking the star maker machinery
And the worst are full of passion
You settle for less than fascination
Bearing beads from California
I'm just living on nerves and feelings
That you can wish upon,
And I'm taming the tiger
(You were only being kind)
Come down to smoke and ash
I felt unfettered and alive
Wild and dear
Gleam
And metal skin and ivory birds
Now parched ribs of sand at his side What a strange, strange boy
Young love was kissing under bridges
Old friends seem indifferent
The eagle for clarity
And temptresses like me
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Take her breath away Out in the wind in crinolines
You know, he put me at ease
Love is gone Everything comes and goes
In a cellar full of antique dolls
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
To be out of my mind
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
I could make our circuitry explode
I got on a plane to Spain
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
The thumb and the satchel
Thinking how I'll feel when I find
It prowls like hookers and thieves
And looking down on everything
I'm going to camp out on the land
It sounded like applause
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
No child to raise
And for people who have slices of you
And crave that day like crazy Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
You must have brought that on
As the radio blared so bland
You called your mother-she was very tanned
Beware of the power of moons
And pitiless as the sun
Who's strong, and somewhat sincere"
And I took these two grey rooms up here
Who's bound to love you
Or stick to some straighter line Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
Aging children, I am one Does the moon play only silver
End of summer
Really hate to see you come falling down
A dream that you tell no one but the gray sea
In love again
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Kept in satin boxes are
Among all the women
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Really hate to see you falling down
And everywhere there was song and celebration
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
Colored stop and go lights flashing
With the clouds and the stars to read
Moon pity me
In the streaming stains
"Daddy, let's get some girls
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Oh all they ever wanted
Come down from the tourist sights
And it's moving its slow thighs
Where some have found their paradise
By the Sea of Galilee Surely some revelation is at hand
Through scattered ruby cloud fires
Given in the night to dark dreams
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
All I wanna make you feel free Born with the moon in Cancer
And tearful at the falling of a star
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory
When you smile?
We'll wink at total strangers passing in
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Watching your hairline recede, my vain darling
I wanna make you feel better, I wanna
That she was out of line
Until I see you again" Who has seen the sun
Do you hear the whimpering waters
On your mark red ribbon runner
Or another lover or your sister
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair
Still the magic echoes in the sand Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy
Women with that teased up kind of hair
Can set up trembling in my bones I know, no one's going to show me everything
To be a lady of the canyon Trina takes her paints and her threads
Oh charity! These bloodless brides of Jesus
With a pink hotel, a boutique
Or be hung in a tree
For the way men looked at me
Surely it's the second coming
Don't it always seem to go
You gave up all the golden factories
Or take off out of here
Like some lame bulb
We were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter
Then she's crying on someone's knee
Still veils this reckless fool here Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink
A girl was in bloom
To buy myself a mandolin
Come in, come in
The lines are open Trina wears her wampum beads
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway Coyote's in the coffee shop
From a wealthy family
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
And feather canyons everywhere
And he tells me all his troubles
Lay down the reeking ore!
When you walk by Below my window
He don't let up the sorrow
On a giant Ferris wheel Up in the neon sky
When I get back to town Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Or just another silly girl
I heard the screen door slam
Everywhere you touch the earth, she's sore
If they just couldn't understand
Now she rallies her defenses
Oh all I ever wanted
Out of a stony sleep
The ceremony sinks
Have a fascination for me A camera pans the cocktail hour
I looked out the window
Just the strong doing what they can
Or some ideals we fight
Don't they hear the melodies
It must be the start of the latest style
Please come in (come in, come in, come in)
You're a cold person too
No matter which route home we take
Never be unkind
When I was working cheap
She's got a rose in her teeth
Cellars and chittlins' When Lester took him a wife
He talks to mother earth to father sky
Really not my home
Some girl's going to see that dress
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes
Can't drum you out of my mind
Caught in the devil's bargain
Take me as I am Help me
Through a parasol of leaves
Fire and ice Don't get jealous
In a self-important voice
Constantly in the darkness
I dreamed of 747's
They don't know you
Then we both get so blue I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
But didn't I see a neon sign
You laugh, he said you think you're immune, go look at your eyes
He cooked good omelets and stews
My fingernails are filthy
California, I'm coming home Oh it gets so lonely
Up there's a heaven
Everything's first class
I don't think so, but I'm
She comes from a school of southern charm
And I knew that he thought
Muscular with gods and sungold
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
The merchants roll their awnings down
Isham jones and gene willaden (1942) So here's to you
A wooden bird with painted wings
There is your song from me Sitting in a park in Paris, France
We are stardust
I thought and I understood as a child-
It was just the arbutus rustling
You dance with the lady
She fills her drawing book with line
While the boarders were snoring
And you think she knows something
I'm frightened by the devil
Of the water weeds
And that can get to be a cold cold war
Where right or wrong
On your contempt for mine
No color no contrast A diamond dog
Just a little green
Innocence is drowned
I could skate away on
The sidewalk is a history book
Things fall apart
In the War of Independence
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
See how that feeling comes and goes
I wish I had a river
But all I really want right now
At your garden gate
And so far from satisfaction Dora says, "Have children!"
Does your smile's covert complicity
In taxi horns and brakes
Richard, you haven't really changed, I said
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
He drank and womanized
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks I can keep my cool at poker
He can think her there beside him
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year- [Chorus] Who has seen the wind
Not the northern one
Out of reach out of cry Out of the city
And the next thing I know
You know it was white lace I was chasing
I wanna renew you again and again
I feel renewed
And you're lying in some room
Fidgeting and bullied
He got the urge for going and I had to let him go
The peacock is afraid to parade
You got the lovin' that I like, all right
And a mighty, mighty, thirst." Seventeen glasses
They've got passport smiles
Don't get over-zealous
And the blossoms hung false
Well I failed
When I'm always bound and tied to someone White flags of winter chimneys
And I brought on my old ways
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
Through the silver wings of bees "I have", said the waters
Needing love and understanding What a strange, strange boy
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
So I hurt you too
And a bottle of German wine to drink
Because I lost my heart Down in the cellar in the Boho zone
When he was only three
Save your smiles and your tears
It hasn't gone to sleep But even on the scuffle
I'm rough but I'm pleasin'
You think I'm like your mother
All the news of home you read
And began to see through a glass darkly Where, as a child, I saw it face to face
Loud and clear
And promises of someday make his dreams
Out of balance,
In the circle game So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
Oh, come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
And I held his face to mine
And they introduce some band
Blue Steel still begging
Really looking well. Aw joe, why don't you go back home?
Knocking for you
(It was so pure)
In a decade full of dreams
You leave 'em laughing when you go
Feeling like your right to be human
Time has been untruthful
That was most inclined
Far from the overkill
There's no one to blame
to another restless night
When I see it again
And play it cool
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight I came upon a child of God
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
"They've been broken in churches and schools
I'm so sick of this game
Governing day, day and night Critics of all expression
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!
From his memory
Bring us round a bottle
Out of reach out of cry I call to a seagull
One minute she's so happy
Tell those girls that you've got Joni
Keep your worries out of sight
Chasing some prize down
He had summer-colored skin
Fifty-fifty
But you've got that look so critical
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Our Lady of Charity?
Smile-keep it light
With your hat tipped off to ladies
I shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight I'm drinking sweet champagne
Come down from the neon nights
Coloring the sunshine hours
Saying, you are welcome back
We all come and go unknown
But all I ever wanted
Breaking like the waves at Malibu So why does it come as such a shock?
When the meadow grass is turning brown Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in
Are spelling it out so clear
And the branches sang the chorus
Settle down into the clickety-clack
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said
"Heart and humor and humility"
Then I thought I had some choice
So the sidewalk leads us with music
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America
Rhine wine
Getting them to feel like that Remember the days when you used to sit
With your fist marks on her face
You can come now
'Till it's gone
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor
Just doing the latest dance craze
With runs in her nylons You read those books where luxury
In a suburban room
And we strike out
She was just shaking off futility
Under crisp white sheets of curfew
Stay with him if you can
These things that you and I suppressed I see something of myself in everyone
To live out in the Arizona sand
We never sold these Black Hills
Were supposed to sleep tight
You brush against a stranger
Looking for sweet fire
An empty space to fill in
Then your life becomes a travelogue
'Cause instead of one head
We love the open road
So here's to you
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery
In the breaking and the breathing
Cold blue steel and sweet fire
I believe him when he tells of loving me
And put up a parking lot They paved paradise
He showed me first you get the kisses
(Oh say can you see) Restless for streets and honky tonks
They start bringing out the hammers
To play Bingo
And all her empires are falling down
While I'm traveling home alone
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Governing blindness, blindness and sight Suntans in reservation dining rooms
When the closing lights strip off the shadows
She may bake some brownies today
When the sun turns traitor cold
Come and carry us away
One day I just disappeared
Out of hand
By a rocking cradle
He went in his own good time Who has seen the stranger
Wrong and right Twinkle, twinkle what a pity
Ooh, ooh, love is blind Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
Like childhood Santa Claus
And she thinks she loves them all
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
It's, be cool!
All because there was no driver on the top My analyst told me
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
You say "Show me the way
They said you beat the girl
And she weaves a pattern all her own
And down to the seaside
Won't you play, little david, play little david, play I don't need no sunday sermon
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
And the oil spills
Maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby, well come on All I really really want is our love to do
I drew a map of Canada
And all the house lights left up bright
Shadows
And he's waiting for reply
At beveled mirrors in empty halls
From the window of a hotel room I'm traveling in some vehicle
Oh I wish I had a river
From Appaloosas and Eagles and tides
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
What's so strange when you know
I get these notes
"Snakes along the railroad tracks."
Seemed out of place
So you packed your tent and you went
He asked me to be patient
Running from the reels Beauty and madness to be praised
And this job he's got
(You were too warm)
From the netherlands hotel
I feel disabled
I fear the sentence of this solitude
And I sing, "Part of me dies
That's the way it's always been. Poor joe, why don't you go back home?
Trouble child
Do you want, do you want, do you wanna dance with me baby
Just at this moment of the world
And the beaches were concrete
Or me here least of all
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
If you come now
Fix this poor bad dreamer!"
Some are cutting
I really don't know life at all I've looked at life from both sides now
To Barangrill The guy at the gas pumps
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
(I was so low)
And a big yellow taxi
One eye for the beat police
My darling's heart could win
Enduring all things-
Faithful
It's down to you You go down to the pick up station
In the circle game Just before our love got lost you said
Man of delight-born again, born again
Dangerous clowns
And lived like old Crusoe
Oh pity me
And he chains me with that serpent
There are box cars down there on your snake
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
It said, "Just Ice"
I remember that time that you told me, you said
Clandestine
In a blue sky I looked at the morning
Oh will you take me as I am
And they were turning into butterflies
"I love to dance"
Oh, radiant happiness
You want me to be truthful
You taste sweet oh
Lonely little grave
While she was busy being free There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And fly away
On their store window trees
Behind the popular song I deal in dreamers
Then they talk like they know you
Just for being so much like you are! You're a coward against the altitude
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
Cry for Eddie in the corner
Is it all books and words
They never can they never can I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Oh the jealousy
He went running through the whisker wheat
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Couldn't bring him to maturity He keeps referring back to school days
And he takes me in his loving arms
And drove them from their hotel bed
You're always disappointed
Where the players lick their wounds
No phones till Friday
I took a plane to a taxi
And there's black babies dancing
Over villages and trees? "I have", said the willow
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
And he sings "Now it's goodbye"
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
One kiss can sometimes
And we'll go down to the beads of guile
And I'll lay down the highway I've got a blue motel room
All alone on such a pretty night
In anarchy
Leaning into mine
You really can't give love in this condition
Then tune me out, 'cause honey Who needs the static
Dying roses will they will their
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
Threatened by all things
I wanna knit you a sweater
Watching your hair and clouds and stars
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Opening its eyes
A round for these friends of mine
To the missile-heads,
I really can't give up just yet
Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go well
Long blue shadows of the jackals
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs
Every song just a one night stand
Help me
But he's just a slave
(I was running blind)
And you were not to blame I heard your baby say
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Call out and glamour to be found
It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
Have a happy ending Just a little green
Like Icarus ascending
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
That son of a bitch
Under neon
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Of faith and hope and love
Genuine junk food for juveniles
Jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I heard my fate turn, turn turn
And lawyers haven't been this popular
And they're poking
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
Tucked into a paperback Guess I'll throw them all away
Some that laughed and some that felt like tears
Wash and balance me
I was holding back from crying
Comes as a guest to take a slave
And those wide, wide open stares
Fallen women
You're not a hit and run driver, no, no
Kick off the sand flies honey
Illumination
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
A room full of glasses
Call her green for the children who have made her little, green
Tonight! Don't interrupt the sorrow
Above the Las Vegas sands
I like the way you hold your drinks
I am flesh and blood and vision
For you and me
May your skies be blue
But you can't get it out of your eyes Nothing is capsulized in me
Now he's got a woman at home
If l had my way
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
There comes a night like this
God of cruelty
I put away childish things
It's, be cool
And you taste sweet oh
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight There's a man who's been out sailing
Our serpents love the whisky bars
And I won't cry No flowers now, no silly candle games
But you know I come when you whistle
Seems like many dim years ago
But you taste so sweet oh
In a blue sky I'm always running behind the time
Now a stranger takes my hand
Tipped off to gentlemen as well. Well joe, why don't you go back home?
They bet their
For eternity
Love stimulated my illusions
Reading fortunes from the penny scale;
And the moon swept down black water
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway We saw a farmhouse burning down
Keeping us tied and true, my old man
I wanna be strong I wanna laugh along
I am smiling at your circles in the air
Kiss of that flaky valentine
I had me a man in summertime
Or the rented Rolls-Royce
I live in a box of paints
All good dreamers pass this way some day
And telephone screamers
To the sound hole and your knee
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
Restless for home and routine
And the bumping of the logs
And finds a lady in a Paris dress
I hope you can pick it up
Because I have got a thing
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I'm selfish and I'm sad
It all comes down to you I awoke today and found the frost perched on the town
And the bloody changes
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings
On a giant ferris wheel Up in the neon sky
He's taken the curtains down
With your father's gun, alone
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
Weak
Is a song so wild and blue
And take their temporary lovers
Well maybe it is just the time of year
They are the ladies of the canyon The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68,
Looking at them on my TV set
I was crazy but I'm not, oh no My analyst told me
Harder and harder just to be nice
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Holding their rulers without a heart
That straddle and strafe
Amelia, it was just a false alarm People will tell you where they've gone
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
Dreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms I went to Staten Island.
That danced on these beaches
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
Somewhere with your wings on time
You should have seen it fly away
Now there's only one day left to go
Be polite
A few drinks later you're not so choosy
That brings me things
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
You do not hide
He seems to want me anyway
I hope you'll be thinking of me
It's funny how these old feelings hang around
I don't know who l am
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
"Do you want to dance?"
Mama and Betsy say-"Find yourself a charity."
And you were not to blame Six hundred thousand doctors
When I get that crazy feeling, I know
Now they got me used to that clean white linen and that
I really don't know life at all Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
In the middle of the night
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
In the smoke of cars [Chorus]
But out here in the headlight beams
He saw my complications
In a blue sky
When I call you up when I'm down
Through bolt locked tenements
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
Your buddies all stood by
They just stuffed her in a hole!
Oh make me feel good rock'n roll band
Where is the lion in you to defy him
In this crowded waiting room (Everybody waiting)
Some are standing in the centre
For her home she gathers flowers
To a Latin drum
Are putting on rubber gloves
Is when it's purring at your side"
Waiting for one last word that calls to beg me stay But I won't cry if that world never comes
Like their fathers before them
One false move and you're a goner
On the F.M. radio
But it's really not my home
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
They're friends and they're foes, too
If you'll come and share a ride" Carnival in Kenora
He sees the damage in my face We got high on travel
On that marbled bowling ball
Kenneled in metered boxes
Empty halls and beveled mirrors
Sex kills Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
Do you wanna take a chance on
Said "He was out of line, girl
Looking for something, what can it be
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
Still be on my feet
And her coat's a secondhand one
To run away and wrestle with my ego
California, I'm coming home. I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
And find the smile I need to wish you well But I won't cry for dusty memories
You've got the lovin' that I like, all right
Cats and babies 'round her feet
I'm going to see the folks I dig
Keeping away my blues But when he's gone
To sun on my shoulders
He pins me in a corner and he won't take "No!" He drags me out on the dance floor
(Just a high fever)
I am traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling
Checking out her sex appeal
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
And he learns to give
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm I wish that he was here tonight
And we're dancing close and slow
In the circle game And go round and round and round
And pigeons fly
No one's future to decide
And he's calling out her name
The blessings of parasites
And harder still to ride
Running to lose the blues
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
How to spot
"Amour, mama, not cheap display"
Given some time to think
Still you know how you need it They open and close you
She waits for the night to fall
And he treats her like a queen
The bed's too big
Made me weak in the knees
And molded to middle class circumstance"
Amelia, it was just a false alarm I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
And also at Einstein
You think we're sleeping--but
Seemed to melt the shadows with his eyes
Looking for an ocean
But you still have your music
Where's that at
Tree to tree
In the mirrors of a modern bank
The milktrucks make their morning rounds
In the blue TV screen light
Craving warmth and beauty
Colors up the sunshine hours
it was the strings of my guitar
Songs are like tattoos
With time on her hands
Pretty baby, won't you
Lots of laughs
Trimmed with antique luxury
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery
Fester on your hotel blind
He lives in another time
Oh, sour grapes
And all the knowledge-
In some neutral cafe
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby
Giving to get something Photo Beauty gets attention
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance
You can't seem to believe it
All we ever wanted
Come in, come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Just gives you the blues So I bought me a ticket
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And the rooms have an empty ring
'Cause I know you're just too proud
We smile and the magic understands Carnival in Kenora
With his face of many faces
That's such a lonely thing to do
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born Hoping and hoping
You were not to blame" When morning comes to Morgantown
And I begged him please to stay
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight You got the touch so gentle and sweet
(Come in, come in)
All emotions and abstractions
We were half a million strong
Never entirely clear
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet
We'd all go looking for a party
To see the tears and the kisses
To talk sense to you
If your feelings are hurtin'
Hey hey
Behind the popular song Blue
Get out of town. I was in an all night movie
Of your changing traffic lights
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
Now, I only know it in part
From up and down and still somehow
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads There was spring along the ditches
She always misses
I still be on my feet I met a woman
That's my best to you Remember this
Old man sleeping on his bags
And lead me on that way
Oh, won't you stay
Come up to my kitchen
Find yourself a girl and settle down
Keep things light
It's life's illusions I recall
And the blankets
Or any reason to resume
Just like that black crow flying
But they always come out holy to my ear Won't you play, little david, play little david, play
The silver power lines
And he thought I was nuts
The black coats and the booze, broke Lakota
They'll say that you're crazy
With her impossibly gentle hands
We can make it if we try"
And they'll plant me in the dirt
Make you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
And I found this empty seat
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
With his facts and figures scrawl
And this spacey So what are you going to do about it
Meek
Since I was seventeen
Petrified wood process
No I won't cry Ill practice what I preach
One for you and one for me"
Lately I don't count on nothing
On this fourth of July
To see if I'm worthy
Like the night's when the Northern lights perform
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
And told yourself were true
I really don't know love at all Tears and fears and feeling proud,
Go to him
I didn't listen to his jive
We'll put on the day
He calls again
Took away my old man
And the power of reason
It's got me hoping for the future
He has kissed her with his freedom
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm
And so I stand and wonder who's to blame
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Oh Canada
and all trees are shivering in a naked row
Look at those jokers
Reflections of love's memories Letters from across the seas
When I think of your kisses my mind see-saws
But then absurdity came over me
And they put up a parking lot Hey farmer farmer
I lay down golden-in time
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
Make you feel free
I'm looking for affection and respect
Now you've got to keep thinking
Stoking the star-maker machinery
He says, "Eagles in jet trails"
They seem so removed from romance"
They wilt the grass they walk upon
And sex kills
Are the times when you don't try
Far from the overload Once in awhile
But they always come out holy to my ear
I'd just turned twenty-seven
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
I wanna be the one that you want to see
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
Hey Blue
And a diamond snake around my arm
And a woman was fading
When I call you up when I get back to town
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Waiting to blow away Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on
To face the dream's malfunction
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born If there's one rule to this game
In a coat of simple brown
They just didn't want to know
Drive your bargains
30 years ago
And ice cream castles in the air
No trouble in their faces
And the seasons they go round and round
Like the church
Rainy days you run
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
And the nails I heard it in the wind last night
Get out of town. There's a soldier in the depot
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Hissing summer lawns He gave her his darkness to regret
Who's coming in now (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Laughing it all away
And some'll try to clock you
The frying pan's too wide Then he comes home
I touched you on the central plains
The songs that the rigging makes
She will love them when she sees them
Before the last revolving year is through
But when I became a woman-
They paved paradise
Or touchy-
Like stations in some relay
And I do good business
Troubling my eyes Shaped like a lion
And put up a parking lot Late last night
You can get one from a friend
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
I really don't know clouds at all Moons and Junes and ferries wheels
If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Mimicking tenderness she sees
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Fall into Lady Release
Gathering in my gaze
But it don't snow here
That Coyote's at my door
She is a lady of the canyon Annie sits you down to eat
Sex kills He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
And we rolled right past that tragedy
I've looked at life that way But now old friends they're acting strange
Oh and all we ever wanted
A dream that you love someone
There's a drummer and a dreamer
If only you will stay
Winds of change patriarchs
A flirt
Every feeling goes on!
In a tea leaf trance or under
And the air conditioned cubicles
Inside you'll hear a sigh
She was out of line
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
And you got to change
I'm a little bit corny
Morning, Morgantown Morning Morgantown
Do I leave silently or boldly say farewell
And go round and round and round
To know you really have no one
Hey honey-you've got lots of cash
He writes "Wish you were beside me
In those push-up brassieres
Do you want to contact somebody first
In the chiming and the clicking
In the circle game Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
A defector from the petty wars
Don't give yourself away I've looked at love from both sides now
Over geometric farms
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Gail and Louise
Sent from up above
And Estrella, dear companion
They see bleeding through their lives
Out of reach Out of cry Every picture has its shadows
For sun on your wings
Sunny Sunday
One day I'm going to die here too
And she only means to please them
Don't you get sensitive on me
They have been handed
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you
Underneath the skin
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
But my heart cried out for you, California
These red words that make a stain
He's cleaned with the tears
And you're up early on your ranch
It's just as natural as the weather
I said "Send me somebody
A foggy lullaby
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids
All I ever wanted
You are a refugee
We're captive on the carousel of time
Do you wanna contact somebody first
I still be on my feet
She's coming back home I've got road maps
Heaven knows I loved you
No dreams can possess you
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Would heal and rise
And they kicked you out in the cold;
With their amber stones and green
With his head full of pool hall pitches
Because I'll be thinking of you
Just before our love got lost you said
Between the forceps and the stone Well I looked at the granite markers
Just when I think he's foolish and childish
And clinging to his child
Shadow of Lady Release
Well something's lost, but something's gained
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born Raging and raging
Looking through a double glass
I called out to be released
Come in (come in, come in, come in)
Over the rented car
When your man gets weak Varnished weeds in window jars
Without mercy Surely some revelation is at hand
Governed by greed and lust?
Play little david, play David he would send them notes a-flyin'
Standing in a waken manner
Breaking like the waves at Malibu Play, little david
Too many tears to welcome in the night
That he was all wrong
That's unique and new
He put it in the ditch
We'll go to the Mermaid Cafe, have fun tonight
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
Still she stays with a love of some kind
'Cause you've lost your heart What are you going to do now
And they tell him,
I am Lakota
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
That guides in the sailors Oh star bright, star bright
Sex kills
I was raised on robbery You know you ain't bad looking
They trickle through your leaky plans
Lost or changing as the days come down to you
I've looked at clouds that way But now they only block the sun
And I get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown
Keeping away my lonesome blues Driving into town
On an island of noise
Of the fine white lines
Old bonds have broken down
Nobody was calling me up for favors
A prisoner of the white lines of the freeway I looked a Coyote right in the face
Do you really laugh?
Last night I couldn't sleep
Into the Magdalene laundries Most girls come here pregnant
Behind a blind of potted palms
And he says:
Till you walk by
In the forest of the night I've got a blue motel room
You're a brute, you're an angel
Written on your spirit this sad song
Aging children, I am one People hurry by so quickly
Or Ron had a car
You taste so bitter
Listen...strains of Benny Goodman
With the sun and the wind away Where to begin to end uncertainty
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
But I wouldn't stay here
If you're still listening there
Your money mocks us
I like you, I like you, I like you Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
It's down to you
Holidays are oh too sad
Out of fear
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe
They have laughed inside her laughter
Edgy-black cracks of the sky
And the wax rolls down like tears
And a big dark horse
Sometimes Chickie had the car
And through the years
Reckless brazen in the play
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
But I was swinging They all laugh at angry young men
How can I think of times that used to be
In a big blue moon
He has seen her at the office
That you don't know what you've got
'Cause they're hip to your tricks
As he climbed the scaley towers
By candlelight
Or what we forsake
To drive to suicide
Down there's a town
Did you get a round resounding for you
Crazy
To give your love too Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind
Some are watching it from the wings
He says, "Coils around feathers and talons on scales
Tall timber down to rock!" Don't interrupt the sorrow
And sometimes there'll be sorrow The wind is in from Africa
Like a cop
And I went running down a white sand road
You think they're gone
Hearing that everything's warmer there
Love is never easy
Everyone hates everyone
He has asked her of her travels
And sip our tea and lemonade
Death and birth and death and birth
Love is never easy street!
"Pin-cushion-prick-
That I was right out of my head
"Do you think this can be real?" Still, I sent up my prayer
Make you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel All the tents are taken down now
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting- [Chorus]
It's like night, night and day
Throwing the lightness on these things
Freely I slaved away for something better
My dreams with the seagulls fly
When I get back to town
I don't know who the arsonist was
For your perversity
And your loneliness In the morning there are lovers in the street
(Boring, boring!)
And it made most people nervous
Its hour come at last
Come in from the cold I am not some stone commission
Fireworks in the sky
On this strange new flesh you've found
On giant screens
You hurry
And she totals your bill
The perils of benefactors
That's my very best to you Everything comes and goes
If you're lying on the beach
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
As we center behind the eight ball
I'm up after midnight, cooking
Not any spring Up in a sterilized room
And the sky forever rushing
And I need your approval Still, I sent up my prayer
You think she's enlightened
He's got a lot of soul
Put up a parking lot They paved paradise
Till we turned into some road house lights
Noble as a nickel chief
And she said drink up now it's gettin' on time to close
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
He drunk up all the rest
I was running like a white-assed deer
With a weak and a lazy mind
Come in from the cold We really thought we had a purpose
Scales to feathers
So why should I feel sorry
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Wanna write you a love letter
I mean what does it really matter
Let's have another round for the bright red devil, who
A rebel loves a cause I'm leaving on the 1:15
No I won't cry for now the story's done
Thinking he's nobody
Sewing lace on widows' weeds
Come home with me, honey
And eggs over easy
To circulate his soul around
Accolades and honors
Big dipper hanging there
I lost my heart
A pretty girl in your bathroom
And with this flame
And a swinging hot spot
Cast iron and frail
And he takes her to a schooner
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
In living out such a reckless life style
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line It was a rainy night
We're trying to get things white as snow
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me
The battered wives
Lately I wonder what I do it for
Oh, they used to laugh at me
They saw you somewhere In some office sits a poet
Now do you think I was crazy?
Boxcars are banging in the yards
And that's not easy
Thinking I don't understand I feel like I'm sleeping
They want you to
Her mirrors and your will
Come in from the cold
Snakes in the grass
In the Gulf of Mexico
The streets were never really mine
Though tonight I can feel you here
There are rivets up here in this eagle
(We were so sure)
You know someone great has gone
She has brought them to her senses
Ink on a pin
Of a forest tree
To see, who in the world you might be You called me beautiful
He says, "Your serpent cannot be denied."
Purring at your side
But to me it was skin to skin
You come to me like a little boy
I found someone to love today I am a woman of heart and mind
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!
If you're worried or uncertain
With the brakes complaining I used to count lovers like railroad cars
With a dark cloud above you Dial in the number
Why'd you have to get so drunk
"Hey, where's Barangrill?" Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
And he tells me all my charms
He has called her from the harbor
She likes to have things her way
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue
From give and take and still somehow
Beneath the Matalla Moon Come on Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now
Judges in black and white
You're a mean old Daddy, but I like you The wind is in from Africa
Morning's just the same Morning's just the same All the people at this party
I've got this fold up sink
Won't you play, little david, play little david, play I had a king in a tenement castle
Because I can't conceal emotion
If you can't find your goodness
They've got the urge for going and they've got the wings so they can go
Branded as a Jezebel
When you're loving and kind
By these bonfires in my spine
And put up a parking lot
Caught a little lace along the seams And you were in the parking lot
Not mine these glamour gowns I stepped outside to breathe the air
Children are up dancing in the streets
(Oh oh)
Like the pull of moon on tides
Won't you play, little david
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
He has missed her in the forest
I'm going to try an' get my soul free
(Lots of other fish in the sea) Play it cool
Standing on sacred land
His blood's bad whiskey
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology."
In the circle game No regrets Coyote
I have come here to lose the smog
The lonely coyote calls
Some longing gets filled
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
How's I ever going to know my home
For she fears that one will ask her
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
I could drink a case of you, I could drink a case of you darling
Then I'm going home to California
And I give you my scorn and my praise
The serpent fighting for blind desire
Taken coming back from the moon
Compelled by prescribed standards
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
That one little victory, that's all she needs
Debase as it admires
My gentle relations
In Thirties evening gowns
The frying pan's too wide My old man he's a singer in the park
And filigree on leaf and vine
Didn't know what to do
Love's the greatest beauty
Applause, applause, life is our cause
I think that it's you instead
And the day is young
Uprising in me tonight
Governing wrong, wrong and right
And of these great three
When I heard the usher say
Black and ragged
Be a gypsy dancer He went to California
From the dark things she feels
With the beauty
Sun pity me
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you
They'll make music in your heart
By the throbbing light machine
In a dark age
Love sees like a child sees As a child I spoke as a child-
With Negro affectations
He says "Your notches liberation doll"
You criticize and you flatter
A dream that the wars are done
With the healers
From girls who just have to tell me
Privately probing the public rooms
And I saw the long white dress of love
Vast are the shadows
Can't numb you out
Self indulgence to self denial
Vine and leaf are filigree
With all my crazy ideas
It's so hard to obey
Striking up an old juke box
And we got drunk on alcohol
On all those double decker buses
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
And you just have to laugh
Father
Wash my guilt of Eden
He went on his own one day And I sing, "One love have I"
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive!
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain
I'm up all night in the studios
With her name on all his papers
But sandcastles crumble
Or you can come later" A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
And you want stimulation-nothing more
Here comes the midnight cowboy again
Hey, where you going
While the sun is ascending
Wondering where it had to go
With the earth spinning
So much said in listening Songs to aging children come
Right on the spot
Circling in singles and in pairs
You're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed, little green
Oh California, I'm coming home
A dollar and a half to see 'em
Generations on down We came up from the subway
It hurts the head
Oh, and the gas leaks
You and I Words and music by
I gave him my warm body
If you want me I'll be in the bar On the back of a cartoon coaster
(I was outa line)
Fuck your strangers
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
I saw a falling star burn up
Oh the power and the glory
Up and down the dial
He says, "Big bird dragging its tail in the dust
To shower off the dust
But leave me the birds and the bees
With a dark cloud above you
Black soot of Lady Release
I'd be cast in shame
You're mean when your loaded
"Give me one good reason why!" What a strange, strange boy
Coward, caught between yes and no
He's swept with the broom of contempt
Now we are black and white
Maybe it's been too long a time since I was
Surely you touched mine 'cause
That night down south between the trailers
Still be on my feet They paved paradise
In sentimental movies
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums Oh, won't you stay
Pouring music down the canyon-
They leech the light out of a room
Was nothing less than prayin'
And we'll talk in present tenses When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
If the next one in the nest
And he makes up his own tune
Gonna take a look around it though Blue
And the gas leaks
Cast upon a beach town
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
Finely tuned like fancy women
Or swinging on the playground swing
'Cause you don't go
In morning, Morgantown We'll rise up early, with the sun
I guess that is the truth
I'm just sounding brass
Hey joe, looking more lost than found
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale
Racing away
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
I said, "Take me to the dance"
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
I made my baby cry He tried hard to help me
A split tongue spirit talks
On the music midnight makes
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
Well, I do accept the changes
And singing songs of joy and peace
In love too fast
To place another heart in him In a Bleeker Street cafe
All that's left is scuffled ground now
He sings Merry Christmas for you
Or the queen of your dreams
It's hip, it's hot
You're a kind person
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
She went to Florida and left you
It was the hexagram of the heavens
And the Lord on death row
Guesses at most
They can never get that close
Comin' through the door with a new fool,
Of refusing a black man admission
He was drinking for diversion
You know I'd go back there tomorrow But for the work I've taken on
To pick up on something shiny
You can even keep the change - to spend. Hey joe, why don't you go back home?
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
Children laughing out to sea
In a blue, blue sky In search of love and music
And it's just you up there
It takes a heart like Mary's these days
Until love sucks me back that way My analyst told me
The sweetest swinging music man
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
And the flowers of deep feeling
And it has some source of light
Crawl and fly
They love the romance of the crime
The nets were overflowing
She waits for the night to fall Out on some borderline
Was just to come in from the cold Come in (come in, come in, come in)
It's just a trick on you
I'd like to call back summertime and have her stay for just another month or so
She says "A woman must have everything" Tomorrow is Sunday
(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
Speculation-well, who's to know
A bright star
'Cause you're headed that way for sure
And you wind up cracking
I can never become that kind [Chorus] I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage
You know it's really hard
And I thought of Anna
In the circle game Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
That was just a dream some of us had
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or a forest or a highway
Oh pity me I am Lakota!
They can balance and they can climb
More than anything And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
And pour your simple sorrow
Just like this train
And a plane went blinking by
I'll put on my finest silver (I'll put on some silver)
I nearly broke down and cried
Mermaids live in colonies
And he asks some guy
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
Would soon be made to pay Friends have told her not so proud
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
While the freeway hisses
I bleed
Just a little blood of his own
To the sign-off prayer What a sorry face you get to wear
'Cause it's all so crazy
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
Dinner alone
Got his gun hired out for pay;
He gave me back my smile
Brave
Over the month of June
Mercenary style I watched the stars chuck down their spears
I know the way" she says
He's a fighting nightingale
Seem to serve me
A celluloid rider comes to town
And I won't cry, goodbye Cold blue steel out of money
But I knew what was happening
At the Magdalene laundries Peg O'Connell died today
The fireworks
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
The world held promise
Or if you come on later?" Red water in the bathroom sink
Some are friendly
And you want to get moving
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Now they locked it up in the bedroom
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
He says, "Wind in the Wings"
The well was deep and muddy
On my hopeless plight
But he went away
That I ever had
Out here on this horizon line
I think I'm falling
We were waiting for the light
Scramblin' down in the street
And the lips you can get
You can't please 'em all
He's a walker in the rain
This is one She pulls the shade, it's just another
Was a photograph of the earth
The ukulele man
And make up your tunes for love
With my teeth sunk in the hand
They say "Humble Makes Pure"
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul
Mother earth
And tinkling cymbals without love- Love suffers long-
Dial in the number
Oh come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Dolphins playing in the sea
Only to deceive me Sharon you've got a husband
I am as constant as a northern star" and I said
Books where artists in noble poverty
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Broken
He got the urge for going
To walk around in so much need
Fire and ice Back in 1957
Where they let you be lazy
Those two bald-headed days in November
And Singapore slings
We have seen the trampled rainbows
Or you're gonna come later" Downtown
Now you turn your gaze to me
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
They look so high
We love our lovin'
I'll walk green pastures by and by Again and again the same situation
To the innocence in here
Through dark indignant
I hope it's better when we meet again baby Star bright, star bright
I get the urge for going
Love's not puffed up-
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
And summertime is falling down The story hit the news
And I sat before his sanity
I left him for the refuge of the roads I fell in with some drifters
We're always keeping score
Don't alarm 'em
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
(We were so young)
Father sky
And watch the morning on parade
On the way to the till
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes
Grass pity me
Valentines and maple leaves
Oh, sex kills
And I longed to lose control
When they sent me to the sisters
No more shiny hot nights
Restless for country-safety-and her
What will happen if I try
By jewel-light
On butterflies and lilac sprays
Hot days your shirt's undone
Of men and angels
No there's no one to name as a traitor here
We can't return we can only look behind
Snug in your bible belt dreams
I tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm A ghost of aviation
This signal here
After twenty centuries
Is going over too
I've got a head full of quandary
They're trying to get ahead
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
Down the line
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, but it's
With a view
He says "Anima rising-
Vexed to a nightmare
Black musician
Are you just checking out your mojo
He would play them fast or slowly
The cleaner's press was in my jeans
Glued to that damn hockey game
Fourth of July
They all laugh at Edison
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France!
Advice and religion, you can't take it
You just can't win it
Nice, kitty kitty
Corruption
All his sea dreams come to me Through the windless wells of wonder
Now you can't afford a little blanket
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne Oh Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
No voices can blame you
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
And now you're seen
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar
Charm 'em
In the pinball arcade
Reran on channel five
They've got stamps of many countries
So many things I would have done
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Of restless multiplicity
I knew that this was meant to be Now I heard little children
And I'll put on some silver (I'll put on some silver)
When I get back to L.A. town
And her heart is full and hollow
Sunlight will renew your pride
This hostile sun beating down on
Win your medals
And the day goes dismal
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me baby
Out of reach out of cry I came to the city
She's a vengeful little goddess
You can crawl, you can fly too
Each so deep and superficial
Trying to make my rent
You must be laughing
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
Sparks fly up from sweet fire
Everybody's in it for their own gain
He picks up my scent on his fingers
We get hurt and we just panic
Below my window No one knows I'm here
Got the headphones up high
Play it cool
I found an old piano
God goes up the chimney
(For my loving crime)
Somehow my feet won't lead me to the doorway
He stakes all his silver
Hmm
And sex sells everything
Across the desert sands
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
To make you smile, to win you with
And we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling He bought her a diamond for her throat
Needles, guns, and grass
There's a black fly buzzing
Crying where are the footprints
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke Sharon, I left my man
To carry the weight of all that greed
They get the urge for going
Will you still love me
It's the lady's choice
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
Oh, come in from the cold
Pleasure moves on too early
Need no sunday shoes
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I would teach my feet to fly
For the photograph machine
That's unlikely! Tonight these crowds
To keep out the unknown
That's what I think
I knew all along
There's the one who sometimes calls
And she aims at the streetlight
In these lines from time to time Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
Chicken scratching for my immortality In the church they light the candles
Restless for the likes of reckless me
Power, ideals and beauty
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
You and I
Cause it is not easy to be brave
Be cool fool
For wrong, wrong and right
Is justice just ice?
The caressing rev of motors
In the middle of nowhere
I can't find my goodness
It rises from the deep
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
Things that you held high
Waving truce against the moon
On either side of town
Grave
You know the times you impress me most
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls
And all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out
Broadcasting tower
