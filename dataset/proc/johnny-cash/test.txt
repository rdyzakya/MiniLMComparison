A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet
And it's the name that helped to make you strong" Yeah he said, "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
General Lee I still miss someone
Waterloo
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name! Yeah I come to the garden alone
The conductor said what could they be
While I'm untanglin' my mind. I ain't gonna repeat
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
My poor heart is healing slow
She said it's two feet high and risin' We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your hand I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
They let him raise the flag and lower it
If you think there's a way
Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow (down by the water)
That I've needed you so
There ain't no grave can hold my body down I want to live,
And baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
Down by the banks of the Ohio I plunged a knife into her breast
And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand That's why I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold
Give me your tomorrow Why me Lord
But he was just a Pima Indian,
By the beautiful river of life Where the charming roses bloom forever
Nobody knows but me The judge said son, what is your alibi
My Mama told me, "Son
Don't ever play with guns
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
When the old man died It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
Danger is double, pleasures are few
And I come away with a different point of view
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67
On my way back to you Lord help me, Jesus
I left Tennessee very much alive
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I went down, down, down
They'll be happy to know
In the sweet by and by To a bountiful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday I'm going down to the river
Sat watching it writing say can you see
And the flames went higher
But might I of Jove's nectar sip,
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
Or the marine that went to war. There they battled up Iwo Jima hill,
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down. I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
There ain't no grave can hold my body down Well, meet me mother and father, meet me down the river road
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And my soft shoes shining Save your love through loneliness
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I will meet you on that beautiful shore All they say we shall meet by the river
Into the light
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold
Last time, last time I was here I had a drink of water
And time keeps draggin' on
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
Fond do Lac
Because you're mine, I walk the line. You've got a way to keep me on your side.
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
Well, I don't mean maybe
I went right home and I went to bed
The ring of fire, the ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
And kill that man who gave me that awful name Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went.
(No laughing during the song please)
Salvador
Still I've got another journey on my mind
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
Cow's in water up past her knees,
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
Oh she was once a true love of mine If you're travelin' in the north country fair
When the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
But I am living still I was a dam builder
The tears and the laughter are things that we share,
I will keep myself
And the folks at Skibbereen
Always be a good boy
And I will pledge with mine.
And I'll meet you further on up the road. I saw her through the window today
But he called me, "That son of a Saginaw fisherman"
That's the way I remember her best If you go when the snowflakes falls
And there ain't no good chain gang. There ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
And pity the miner digging my bones Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
The back biter
Kingston
That I can repay
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
Made a good run but I run too slow
Then I walked across the street
But Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me
You say you're lookin' for someone
Brothers
The forty shades of green But most of all I miss a girl
Just like you always do
I had a steady job till I started into drinking
That's water
Watch him make the cold-steel ring" But the bad boss came up laughin' at John Henry
I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: "Don't stop."
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
It's hard for thee to kick against the prick
Celebrated through the land,
If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet?
Least of all the newly-weds of Saginaw, Michigan Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
But sometimes at night, when the north wind moans
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
And there ain't no good chain gang. I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
We got in a fight over Tennessee
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
One Have you come here for forgiveness?
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
I will let you down
And hypnotized and fascinated,
Would you have my baby? If you were a carpenter
The things we've done and seen
Things like there ain't no good in an evil hearted woman, And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
Have you come here to play Jesus
That's cocaine blues.
Toronto
He won't answer anymore,
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
But she opened the door and said "Honey, take me for a spin." So we drove up town just to get the tags
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing
Were you there when they crucified my Lord? Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
Were you there when the stone was rolled away? Just as I am without one plea but that
So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
And let that two-nineteen special ease my troubled mind Trouble in mind, I'm blue
When I hear that whistle blowin'
And Sunday morning coming down In the park I saw a daddy
And my wife forever be
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot
She turned blood red in World War Two
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
And tell the world that everything's OK,
But I really can't remember when
Upon my liars chair
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And our way, is on the road again Just cant wait to get on the road again
Argentina
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair!
Five feet high and risin' Well, it's five feet high and risin' (When he reached down his hand for me)
On the windy corner of a dirty street
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud Click here for correction service info.
The gambler,
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote. But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg.
Get rhythm, when you get the blues. Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And uh, I don't know what the hell it run off
If I bow my head and beg God for his forgiveness
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
We've already learned a whole lot of stuff already, Things like there ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
And all the girls from there to Austin,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday We're the best partners this world's ever seen,
On down to San Antone When I was just a baby
We got a special surprise for, you fellas
Can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
So I hung my head and I cried You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
She loves you, Big River, more than me. Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
When the man comes around Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Boston
Devil's Lake
With many a conflict and many a doubt
There ain't no good in an evil hearted woman, And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Down by the banks of the Ohio Well my daddy left home when I was three
Rexburg
Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean.
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
We take her down every night
'Til the blue skies
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Old memories would win her heart for sure
Round the curve came a passenger train
And he talks with me [Chorus] I'd stay in the garden with Him
What I said any more
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
Don't know when
For the Father waits over the way
And the motor turned out to be a seventy three
To rid my soul of one dark blot
And I cant wait to get on the road again I was a highwayman
We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right
I've been everywhere, man
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Come on you gotta listen unto me
But thou thereon did'st only breathe,
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go I was runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
And the melody that He gave to me
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong. The transmission was a fifty three
I've wasted it so
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
We're one but we're not the same
You'll never see me wear a suit of white. Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
After Texas Red Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere;
With your tail tucked between your legs,
There is no sickness, no toil, nor danger
I bet he's wishing he could go fishing,
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die. There ain't no grave can hold my body down
But I remember everything What have I become
The emerald of the sea
"I can hoist a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too."
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
John Henry said to the steam-drill "How is you?
I've killed the only girl I love
And I still miss someone I still miss someone
I've been to redwood
Chickapee
See for me that her hair's hanging down
Well this is the worst trip since I have been born So hoist up the John B sail. Drink to me only with thine eyes
And it echoed through the canyons
From a fancy dining car
Knoxville
But I will remain
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
But she's in good shape for the shape she's in
Such a foolish fool, God ain't known no greater sinner
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back. Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout'
A man will have less for the lure of the mine
Idaho
Nobody knows but me Can I have a glass of water?
Four feet high and risin'
But I know I had it comin'
'Til we gather in Heaven's bright city
Boy that's a long stroke. Wooo that's a long stroke Ira Hayes...
I just sang last night for the first time
There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
I'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
Someone to close his heart
More than a lot?
Not a servant so faithful he found
And a picker to make 'em ring
I'll only let you down
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
'Til I got me a skinful of silver and gold Me and a gambler, we couldn't agree
He had the nerve and he had the blood
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
And you want me to go without Well it's too late
Danger is double and the pleasures are few
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
He said, "You full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
Crater Lake For Pete's Sake I've been everywhere, man
Help me, Jesus
Bet you sister's still on the phone,
Thank you very much.
I am still right here What have I become
Tremble
Try to kill it all away
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
It's you, It's you, must go, and I must bide But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Click here if you need help. Your own personal Jesus
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
That's half as lonesome as the sound
I love the girl with the golden hair
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
Tonight
To the lepers in your head? Did I ask too much?
And I'm getting old. I've been to Hollywood
He said, naw, it'll do for our little town
Beside the texas flag, but she waved on though
And there ain't no good chain gang.
I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee
She hung limp and low a time or two
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
She was glad to see me
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud I rode right back across Arkansas
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
And He walks with me
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
Called him my Pa, and he called me his son
I'll be gone, like I said. You'd just say the same old thing
Tennessee
I'm going top take me a rocking chair
Tinnesay
I can't be holding on
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
If I give my soul, and she knows I really mean it
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I got mules
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson.
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
You know I'm a forgiver Reach out and touch faith
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Please don't take my sunshine away You told me once, dear, you really loved me
That should be the envy of most any man
I shall not be moved Well I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
I'd have your baby Save your love through loneliness
Flesh and bone
True love of mine
And was always his treasure and pride
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
