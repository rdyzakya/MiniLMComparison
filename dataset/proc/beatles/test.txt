I just need someone to love
Well it's my birthday too--yeah
Yes, you can radiate everything you are
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I know I'll often stop and think about them
All these places have their moments
Or the sounds he appears to make
Junior's head is hard as rock
Nobody can deny that there's something there
Hey, bulldog
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
A home sweet home
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
How to unfold your love
Oh, you know I will What would you think if I sang out of tune
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Hey, hey, hey, and I do. Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be,
Ah
Wigwam frightened of the dark
It's such a feelin' that my love
In our little hideaway beneath the waves

Would you promise to be true

I love you... I want you, I want you, I want you
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
(Happy and they're safe) We would be so happy you and me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine.
And all I have to do is think of her
Come together right now
Hey you've got to hide your love away Last night I said these words to my girl
You let your face grow long I am the eggman
From the very start
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue You can talk to me
Think of what I'm saying,
Well, this rock and roll has got to stop
Man, junior, behave yourself Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
By making his world a little colder
Take a sad song and make it better
Sleep pretty darling
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes? Look around round
The coral that lies beneath the waves
In my life, I love you more
The act you've known for all these years
Happy birthday to you. Yes we're going to a party party
I must be sure
Who is it for All the lonely people
And I love her A love like ours
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
I guess nobody ever really done me
Strawberry Fields forever Always know sometimes it's me
You know you should be glad You know it's up to you
Some forever, not for better
I break down Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
To help with good Rocky's revival Try to see it my way,
I need to, I need to, I need to
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Restless wind inside a letter box
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
In an octopus' garden with you. One two three four
Aye, Sir, aye
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Your song will fill the air
And in the evening he's a singer with the band [Chorus] And if you want some fun sing ob la di bla da When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now
I need somebody to love
is not enough to show I care Love you every day, girl
He shoot Coca-Cola
She said she'd always been a dancer
Girl I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden near a cave We would sing and dance around
A noise comes from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Don't you think the joker laughs at you
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
When I'm sixty-four.
We all want to change the world But when you talk about destruction
It's certainly a thrill
I'd fall in love with her
Cos I don't care too much for money, and money can't buy me love I'll give you all I got to give if you say you'll love me too
Strawberry Fields forever No one I think is in my tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude There are places I'll remember
And you're working for no one but me.
Mountain way down south
It isn't hard to do
You know I love you still
I need to make you see
Well, he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
Remember to let her into your heart
No, I never saw them at all
The man of a thousand voices
Love is all, love is you Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
She's the kind of girl
Nowhere to go
And now she says she knows
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
Ah, girl, girl, girl When I think of all the times
I break down
Still my guitar gently weeps. Oh yeah, all right
Oh, that magic feeling
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Her majesty's a real nice girl
I don't know how someone controlled you
It's all right Once there was a way,
And I noticed there wasn't a chair I sat on a rug biding my time
It's so hard to reason with you
And so I quit the police department
To get back home. Sleep, pretty darling,
Are you gonna be in my dreams tonight? Love you, love you
And I held her hand in mine Oh we danced through the night
While you see it your way
And she keeps calling
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
Sleeps in a hole in the road
When your lights have gone.
Dark is the sky
He got hair down to his knee
"It's time for bed" She told me she worked
And the way she looked
I told her I didn't
In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Let me hear you say Hey you've got to hide your love away
Good day sunshine,
I don't know how you were inverted
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
But I thought that you might like to know
Take me to your daddy's farm
Don't let me down, don't let me down And from the first time that she really done me
So please, love me do
He got Ono sideboard
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Won't you please, please help me When I was younger, so much younger than today
I don't know why you say "Goodbye", I say "Hello-wow, oh. Hello".
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
smiles awake you when you rise
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Waits at the window, wearing the face
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye. Hello, goodbye.)
And hope that my dreams will come true
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Love you whenever we're together
In an octopus' garden in the shade We would shout and swim about
I love her She gives my everything
And was buried along with her name
Me back again. Yeah!
All right, all right, all right
Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know how you were diverted
Lucy in the sky with diamonds A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
All your life
That's all I do
Oh, when I saw her standing there Well my heart went boom
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
With a little help from my friends I am he as you are he as you are me
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
Once there was a way to get back home
And I'll send all my loving to you I'll pretend that I'm kissing
All together now
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
You know I believe and how Here come old flat top
We'd love to take you home I don't really like to stop the show
And I, I could see
Molly is the singer in a band
Nowhere man, can you see me at all
Made the bus in seconds flat
(I say "Yes", but I may mean "No").
Help, you know I need someone, help When I was younger, so much younger than today
That the singer's going to sing a song
Just sees what he wants to see
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
And I will sing a lullaby. Once there was a way
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman Should five per cent appear too small
That the rain washed away
Lead me to your door Oh, I need your love, babe
They can tell what he wants to do
You know I feel alright
No, I never heard it at all
Love you when we're apart And when at last I found you
But everyone knew her as Nancy
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, Sunday mornings, go for a ride
You and me chasing paper
Every summer we can rent a cottage,
And I will sing a lullaby.
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
Where do they all belong? Ah look at all the lonely people
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
Could never die
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
He creeps up from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play,
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
We can work it out Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
You're gonna say you love me too So oh I should realized a lot of things before
Because the sky is blue...aaaaaaahhhh Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh... Picture yourself in a boat on a river
In the church where a wedding has been
I think it's only fair
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
Me, woah yeah, like I please you
Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy
The kiss my lover brings
Saving up to buy him some clothes
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
No one you can save that can't be saved.
Pretty little policemen in a row
A crowd of people turned away
But I got to get a bellyful of wine
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? She asked me to stay
I could be handy, mending a fuse
I only send you my invitations
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.
The many ways I've tried But still they lead me back
She's just the girl for me
Strawberry Fields forever Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Be thankful I don't take it all
Imagine all the people
Something in her style that shows me
But nobody wants to know him
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
Can I take my friend to bed
Her majesty's a pretty nice girl
Dance before me like a million eyes,
I can't hide Yeah, you got that somethin'
Juba juba juba
We're going home Two of us sending postcards
Some kind of solitude is
You only give me your funny paper
Thoughts meander like a
She acts as if it's understood
I want to hold your hand
Sky of blue and sea of green
Love you with all my heart
Over me He bad production
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
When I feel that somethin'
Hey, bulldog Hey man Whats up brother? Roof What do ya say I say, roof You know any more? Ah ah (you got it, that's it, you had it)
An octopus' garden with me
And we held each other tight
In my life, I've loved them all But of all these friends and lovers
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet. Don't ask me what I want it for
You don't know what it's like
You know you twist so fine
Goo goo g' joob Goo Goo Goo g' joob Expert, texpert choking smokers
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
He was such a stupid get You'd say I'm putting you on
You say it's your birthday
Then you begin to make it better And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
That's it man, wo ho, that's it, you got it Woah Look at me man, I only had ten children Ah ah ah ah ah ah ha ha ha ha
When friends are there
All good children go to heaven
Sees the sun going down
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends Do you need anybody?
Take your time, don't hurry
Resting our head on the sea bed
Lives in a dream
Well, you know
Does it worry you to be alone?
