Handing out free tickets
They pass by so silently
In the home of the brave
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
To get through to the man in me										 
			You may be an ambassador to England or France
Across the swamp of time?
			When your mother sends back all your invitations
With your pencil in your hand
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
From fixtures and forces and friends
When you are near 
But the enemy I see
She says, “You can’t repeat the past.” I say, “You can’t? What do you mean,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
But rather get you down in the hole
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
She’s wearin’ a multi-thousand dollar gown
They all play on pennywhistles
But there’s violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
I asked Fat Nancy for somethin' to eat, she said, “Take it off the shelf—
A world war can be won
They know the secrets of the breeze
And see the lights surrounding you
Just arrived here from the coast
Change my way of thinking, make myself a different set of rules
Don’t you understand
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
I know they're not what they seem
That runs down my drain
Sky full of fire, pain pourin’ down
And something inside of him died
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot
And these bad luck women stick like glue
You ought to be a fool about me 
When there is no more
They’ll stone ya and then they’ll say, “good luck”
When I’ve forgotten all the rest
And you’re always achin’
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate
It only goes to show
That he’s tall, dark and handsome, and you’re holding his hand
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Didn’t think that they would pass
Well, I’m hangin’ on to a solid rock
I’m younger than that now
I don’t need them anymore
You can just follow your nose
That you needed to hear me say
When you were there
My grandfather was a duck trapper
So pray from the mother
			“Oh, help me in my weakness”
What made them want to come and blow you away?
You might say I’m unlearned
“You can’t open your mind, boys
I see my light come shining
Everybody said they’d stand behind me
But there’s only one authority
And you don’t deserve me
We’re so alone
The only one I know
Yes, I wish that for just one time
You’re the queen of my flesh, girl, you’re my woman, you’re my delight
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
To be without a home
As human gods aim for their mark
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
I used to care, but things have changed										 
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”
And never sat once at the head of the table
Wiggle on your hands and knees
Limited in sex, they dare
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
By insurance men who go
“My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one
Grandma said, “Boy, go and follow your heart
To keep it in your mind and not forget
And no matter what they say
Still capture the minutes I’m in
In her honky-tonk lagoon
I'm wild about you, gal 
The chance won’t come again
But everybody wants you
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
Take or shake or forsake you out
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”
When it's time to go you got an open door
Has dimmed my sights
			Broken lines, broken strings
Either one, I don’t care”
That you ain’t a-got no friend
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
Well, they’ll stone you when you walk all alone
Six-time losers
Then why don’t she tell
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her
But you have heard of them
I do believe I’ve had enough										 
Hang around the theaters
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out
Darkness on the face of the deep
Yet it’s hard t’ think on
Unborn and unnamed
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
From all the plans they do pursue
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Baby can’t be blessed
Me drinkin’ from my broken cup
Ev’rybody knows
As I stepped out of the womb
I wanna be with you in paradise
And that’s the authority on high
You can smell the pinewood burnin’
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
Sugar Baby get on down the line
That can do what’s never been done
Knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand										 
Thank You, Lord
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew										 
To be alone with you										 
You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books
Get sick, get well
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby
In the precious wind they rot
I got eight carburetors, boys I’m using ’em all
To Desolation Row
But I’ll sit down on this bank of sand
He made it to Kansas City
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
Watch the river flow
To find the man in me
The National Guard stands around his door
Tomorrow keeps turning around
You’ve never learned to read or write
You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
Man’s ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don’t apply no more
There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend										 
And the people that confronted him were many
The drunken politician leaps
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
For them that think death’s honesty
Is there anyone that cares?
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Everything changes
See them big plantations burning
And later on as the crowd thinned out
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ ’long the street
Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain’t no neutral ground
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
On a South Dakota farm
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months
And your legs can’t seem to stand
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Do you think that it could
And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
He’s getting ready for the show
She was standing there in back of my chair
The vagabond who’s rapping at your door
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Girls like birds flying away
The empty-handed painter from your streets
I said, “That’s all right mama . . . you . . . you do what you gotta do”
You used to laugh about
And how I know I’ll make it through
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
When you went out to receive
Ever since the world began
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Statues made of matchsticks
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn to cry awhile
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed
You better duck down the alley way
Some on their way up, some on their way down
He could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork
I tell myself something’s comin’
I’m walkin’ down that long, lonesome road, babe
You can mislead a man
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
He gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell
The fire's gone out but the light is never dying
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Don’t try “No-Doz”
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
Bankers’ nieces seek perfection
I’m drownin’ in the poison, got no future, got no past
But still remains
In the darkness of my night
For so long I’ve been hindered
To sit down on this bank of sand
Of this I can’t say very much
I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame
Stone-cold dead
Señor, señor, let’s disconnect these cables
From East to West
She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
But you I'll remember always
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound										 
You looked for work and money
Where the executioner’s face is always well hidden
			Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all
More of an outlaw than you ever were
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
I’ve been saved
High water everywhere
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
He’s going to the carnival tonight
The Law can’t touch her at all
And he says, “How?”
Well, I’ve been up all night, baby
You ain’t seen nothing like me yet
But people don't live or die, people just float
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Someday you'll be glad to have me around
I won't be back ‘til fall
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Abandoned it out West
They may call you Doctor or they may call you Chief
They’re taking a street car named Desire
Oh! what would I do
Yes, ’n’ how many seas must a white dove sail
He was an outlaw, that’s for sure
Your wife’s screams are stabbin’ you
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Let me see what you got
Wedding bells ringin’, the choir is beginning to sing
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait										 
Says he’s got a bad cough
The night blows cold and rainy
I wish that for just one time
Try hard, get barred
Well, I’m preachin’ peace and harmony
So I drifted down to New Orleans
You’ll be drenched to the bone
To be just like I am
We see this empty cage now corrode
In somebody’s room
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
’Cause I believe in you										 
Well I got here followin' the southern star
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Then she opened up a book of poems
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
We just saw it from a different point of view
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
My eyes they start to fade
After he took from you everything he could steal
Please tell her thanks a lot
I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off
Burns with the bark still on
Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
People disagreeing everywhere you look
When I met you, baby
He’ll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman										 
But build to destroy
I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Where many martyrs fell
But I ain’t hearing any
And glowed like burnin’ coal
An’ the silent night will shatter
Well, I try my best
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you
Preacherman seeks the same, who’ll get there first is uncertain
Nobody to rescue me
The other is in his pants
Oh! Lord! Just like mine!
And scream it
She’s got no place to fall
I will follow your casket
And the mother had to turn her face away
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide
And his cabin fallin’ down
And she also keeps the cards that read
Now ain’t the time for your tears
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter
			I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind
Now you don’t talk so loud
He saw an animal leavin’ a muddy trail
He could die happily ever after
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
For the saving grace that’s over me
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”
What price I pay 
Though I’d never say
My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face
Mona tried to tell me
If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry
So many things that we never will undo
Sweet Melinda
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
Shut softly your watery eyes
Take a woman like you
Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Of what belongs to me
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
Come writers and critics
Even though you’ve only seen ’m one time or two
I’m just thankful and grateful
Things should start to get interestin' right about now
With only you in view
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
In the instant that I preach
Make you spin or do you in
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
Well Abe says, “Where do you want this killin’ done?”
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
An’ I say, “Aw come on now
Folks lose their possessions—folks are leaving town
Then they’ll stone you and then they’ll come back again
But I’ll know my song well before I start singin’
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
To keep her from the howlin’ winds
To her, death is quite romantic
All except when ’neath the trees of Eden
And the smell of their roses does not remain
But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?
And somebody else says, “Where what is?”
Excuse me, ma'am I beg your pardon
I’m leavin’ today
This kind of love; I’m love sick
Now all the authorities
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
To make your time more easy passin’
How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?
That too many people have died?
As friends and other strangers
Seem to be all that there is
Rock me for a little while, rock me ’til there’s nothing left to feel
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?
An’ here I sit so patiently
Is this pain in here
Though I cannot explain that in lines
The whole world is filled with speculation
To do anything they wish to do but die
Many times I’ve often prayed
Your old road is rapidly agin’
Sure was gonna be rough
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
It’s a price I have to pay
On anyone that lives in a vault
I’ll be on my way
Your children are so hungry
I met a young child beside a dead pony
We pointed out the way to go
While calypso singers laugh at them
We’re gonna forget it
Life sometimes must get lonely
That don’t mean no one no good
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
As if it was a purse
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Best notify my next of kin
I just don’t see why I should even care
Why she did go
That you must be exactly like them
By His power I’ve been lifted
The cold rain can give you the shivers
For I’m one too many mornings
Pourin’ off of every page
I believe in you even on the morning after
The world of research has gone berserk
What good am I then to others and me
When you know as well as me
It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line
My pulse is runnin’ through my palm–the sharp hills are rising from
But you don’t understand
She’s a hypnotist collector
I’m gonna let you pass
You’re very well read
It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Then time will tell just who fell
For you know not the hour in which I come”
His hair’s falling out and all of his daughters need shoes
The lover who just walked out your door
I’m gonna tame the proud
Someone who will die for you an’ more
Take a deep breath, feel like you’re chokin'
Well, I saw him
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And the ladies treat me kindly
Could you ever be true? I think of you
			Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born
Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ’em
You don’t have to be afraid
Oh, Jokerman, you don’t show any response
Oh, the leaves began to fallin’
Is worth more than I could pay
I had a woman down in Alabama
Go lightly on the ground
Well, I heard that hoot owl singing
I know I can’t escape
“You Belong to Me I Believe”
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
As they carried him from the courtroom
In you, my friend, I find no blame
You have to pay to get out of
The cat’s in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
Let me ask you one question
To strict party platform ties
Up on Housing Project Hill
How many times must a man look up
And charm the whistle off an evening train
People tell me it’s a sin
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
Oh, what’ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
I’ve followed the river and I got to the sea
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
You think He’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires
You to me were the best
And the seas began to part
And don’t criticize
Its curfew gull just glides
“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
To make you feel my love										 
And said that way down on Highway 61
			Well, if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
As great as you are a man
Behind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of pain
The midnight rain follows the train
Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor
Everybody movin’ if they ain’t already there
And pack up your tent
All the people we used to know
Queen for queen
I'm going away baby
To Desolation Row”
Well, I’ll sell it to ya at a reduced price
Well, there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
They say don’t come back no more
I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town
May you build a ladder to the stars
Don’t say I never warned you
Forget the dead you’ve left, they will not follow you
She ain't no angel and neither am I
			The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
He said come here and step into the light, he says hmm you’re right
Well, she talks to all the servants
			Forgetful heart
God knows you ain’t gonna be taking
And there is no one there to dry your tears
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Find out something only dead men know										 
An’ if anybody asks me
Down upon your knees
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat
I lived with them on Montague Street
“You fail to understand,” he said
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
Don’t matter what you did
And there’s nothing she doesn’t see
I don’t care about astronomy
You may call me anything but no matter what you say
Well, they’re living in a happy harmony
Heading for the Gates of Eden
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
She is good to me
Not by works
Neither one gonna turn and run
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
For Halloween give her a trumpet
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And every window made of glass
Big Joe Turner lookin’ east and west
Spouted out that liberty
Is it really any wonder
Saying, “Death to all those who would whimper and cry”
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to keep your seat
To see you tryin’ to be a part of
			William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge
Don't know what to do without it
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
The answer is blowin’ in the wind
When you get home
It’s just a shadow you’re seein’ that he’s chasing
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Then they’ll stone ya when you’re there all alone
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Some are mathematicians
But you know sometimes you lie
And fishermen hold flowers
And he walks on stilts
I heard the drifter say
I’m closin’ the book
I say it so it must be so 
And somebody points to you and says
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Now the rovin’ gambler he was very bored
With the Memphis blues again										 
I can't hardly sleep 
I’m paintin’ the town—swinging my partner around
But you know how hard you try
If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud
And yes, there’s something you can send back to me
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Ain’t no use joking
You put a gun in my hand
To get you your favors done
The whole night through
And I’ve waited all day long
“Don’t reach out for me,” she said
Stand upright and be strong
Before they’re allowed to be free?
I’ve escaped death so many times, I know I’m only living
From Desolation Row
If you’re havin’ a good time
Someone to open each and every door
And life is brief
I got a head full of ideas
We all wear the same thorny crown
At your feet to convince you of your pain
“The trial was bad enough
I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh
I can hear their hearts a-beatin’
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
But it ain’t me, babe
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
When he hears you speak
Rain won’t lift
I can hear them rebels yell
To make you feel my love
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
To talk out of turn
God knows it’s a struggle
If it’s information you want you can go get it from the police
They’re getting ready for the feast
Most ev’rybody really thought
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
You’ll remember you’re the one
I could live forever
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
As they were taking down the tents
Sets my heart a-reeling
So I remember ev’ry face
You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy
We’ll both just sit there and stare
Before he can see the sky?
And you’ll be fine at the end of the line
Yes, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you										 
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to make a buck
Where I will always be renewed
Walkin' ‘til I'm clean out of sight
I’m forty miles from the mill—I’m droppin’ it into overdrive
Perhaps I’d rob them
As I was walkin’ away
An’ a thousand miles behind										 
But I found him there instead
I’m gone
“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”										 
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Down boulevards of broken cars
I’m sittin’ on my watch so I can be on time
He’s not a gentleman at all—he’s rotten to the core
Up the road around the bend
Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
Struck the courthouse out of shape
Bad blood it got your mare
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
Quicker than anyone I knew
When the wind blows through the piney wood
Sometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under
Where the heart-attack machine
Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
Flows out of their bodies
But what do you care? Ain’t nobody there would want to marry your sister
“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
			The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
Eclipses both the sun and moon
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
You can have your cake and eat it too
If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see
You can carry all my thoughts with you
Then sends them out to the jungle
And he screams back, “You’re a cow
Ringing up and down the line
Introduced as friends
Daddy’s in the alley
You had no faith to lose
			Seen the arrow on the doorpost
And I’m so glad
I’m singin’ love’s praises with sugar-coated rhyme
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote
			Darkness at the break of noon
But it was more than I could do
Swords piercing your side
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon
I just want you to know
We living by the golden rule, whoever got the gold rules
Queen Mary, she’s my friend
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
How can I explain?
			I love you pretty baby 
			Lost John sitting on a railroad track
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’
Call me for dinner, honey, I’ll be there
Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank
Crying like a fire in the sun
I can't go to paradise no more
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
God knows it’s a crime
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
Someone else is speakin’ with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart
But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
He’s dressed up like a squire
All your reindeer armies, are all going home
But you knew that we would meet again
And I still do not know
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Without this love that we call ours
You just kinda wasted my precious time
I don’t want to straight-face you
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Like the dirty drivin’ rain
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
Watchin’ the river flow
That they don’t know how to smile
Jesus said, “Be ready
Gonna put my good foot forward
It’s your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat										 
Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail
They show me to the door
You’d know what a drag it is
It’s all new t’ me
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
But you know you could be wrong
I keep thinking about you baby 
’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight
I’m in the streets
Walk on your tiptoes
Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”
			Johnny’s in the basement
Just do your thing, you’ll be king
He woke up, the room was bare
With the heat rising in my eyes
I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street
God knows there’s a chance
Great big furry back and furry hair
“Oh, stop that cursed jury”
You just stood there grinning
Then you turned up again
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
You’ve thrown the worst fear
And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
			The man in me will do nearly any task
And if I don’t make it
I’ve been wading through the high muddy water
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you?
In the last outback, at the world's end										  
That knows more than they do
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
I met a young woman whose body was burning
Traveling through the dawn of day
I’m not the one you want, babe
			Mama, take this badge off of me
“just because”
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
To hold each other tight
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
			You say you love me
Who just couldn’t help but cry
I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train
Señor, señor, do you know where she is hidin’?
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
My ship is in the harbor
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
Where lovely mermaids flow
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
But you know you’re not that strong
Wiggle—you can raise the dead
Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
You see, you’re just like me
High water risin’, the shacks are slidin’ down
You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Into the ditch of what each one means
I can’t stay in here
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
			I got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Freedom just around the corner for you
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’
People carry roses
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
With his wife and five children
But to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity
Jefferson turnin’ over in his grave
I know the kinds of things you like
I’m gonna revitalize my thinking, I’m gonna let the law take its course
When you're with me
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden										 
			To be alone with you
And you hide from my eyes
Well, the rifleman’s stalking the sick and the lame
You say you disturb me
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams 
Ain't talkin', just walkin'
If there’s a poor boy on the street
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin’
People can’t wait—they’re gathered around
She ain’t got no shoes
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky
Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
The Titanic sails at dawn
It's gonna be the meanest flood
I can't save a dime
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go 
Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain’t right
I’m watchin’ the roads, I’m studying the dust
Ain’t runnin’ any race
That can win what’s never been won
Everybody's going and I want to go too
You gonna need my help, sweetheart
When the roses fade
I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I know there is no help I can bring
From Eli he did come
I always kind of wondered
I would want again tomorrow
If you don’t know by now
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
I’m lettin’ the cat out of the cage, I’m keeping a low profile
To get you facts
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
And I’m one too many mornings
My pretty baby, she’s lookin’ around
A bed that is never mine
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ancient footprints are everywhere
Forever young, forever young
And now he’s buried in the rocks
			Summer days, summer nights are gone
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake
He’s not selling any alibis
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
But these to tell what’s true
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts
Oh, though the earth may shake me
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
Into leaving his post
But the post office has been stolen
But deep inside my heart
Feel like a fighting rooster—feel better than I ever felt
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
I came to see you
And put us on our way
Your grass is turning black
When I’m gone you will remember my name
An’ it strangled up my mind
To each his own, it’s all unknown
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
But nobody has any respect
			Perhaps it’s the color of the sun cut flat
I'm listenin' to the steel rails hum
I don’t need much and that ain’t no lie
To your tambourine in time, it’s just a ragged clown behind
Don’t know how it all got started
Who just happened to be feelin’ that way without warnin’
Automobile comin’ into style
Next animal that he did meet
I hope that you can hear
All across the peaceful sacred fields
I had to rearrange their faces
There’s too many people, too many to recall
			Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
God knows you’ve got to weep
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Even if we’ve got to walk a million miles by candlelight										 
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
But you don’t mean it
You spent your last lone dollar
Cares not to come up any higher
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
When she’s comin’ after me?
Pack up your suitcase
The phone’s tapped anyway
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
Ain’t it hard when you discover that
No one in front of me and nothing behind
To be seeing the real you at last
If you go down in the flood
Let us hope they’ve found mercy in their bone-filled graves
May your heart always be joyful
Leaves begin to stir
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
And don’t speak too soon
You don’t need a weatherman
And you say, “For what reason?”
I’d be lost if not for you
With your position and your place
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind
But by His mercy I’ve been spared
You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
Seven shots ring out
They’ll stone you when you are set down in your grave
My pathway led by confusion boats
No boat's gonna row
Like the ocean’s pounding roar
			High water risin’—risin’ night and day
And I’m seeing the real you at last
“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue
The circus is in town
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy
			Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Private reasons great or small
You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
Broken threads, broken springs
You’re a big girl now
Your brain is a-bleedin’
It don’t matter, anyhow
Keep me where you are
Well I’m drivin’ in the flats in a Cadillac car
I take what I get until I even the score
And I was standin’ on the side of the road
And I walk out on my own
			Every step of the way we walk the line
You are a walking antique
Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
			The air is getting hotter
			Can’t you hear that rooster crowin’?
Trustin’ their fate to the Hands of God
Somebody seen him hanging around
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
That you belong to
Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again
Little Jack Horner’s got nothin’ on me
