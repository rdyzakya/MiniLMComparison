I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind
They’re dripping with garlic and olive oil
You probably don't know, but I'm gonna make you mine
Badge out, laid off
I don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts
And I was dying there of thirst
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about
Nothin' standing there
Last night the wind was whisperin’, I was trying to make out what it was
He’s a coward and he steals
One summer’s day he came passing by
Every day you got to give yourself a chance
As she, herself, prepares for him
She wears an Egyptian ring
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Though you just thought it was nothing more
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
If you’re so hurt
But nobody can sing the blues
Rain fallin’ on my shoes
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl										 
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
You could stand inside my shoes
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
There’s a chain gang on the highway
We always did feel the same
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
One of these days and it won't be long
Only a matter of time ’til night comes steppin’ in
Whatever colors you have in your mind
Last night ’cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection
You hand in your ticket
You took the silver, you took the gold
And she invites you up into her room
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with
Which we never could believe
It blows the minds most bitterly
I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
No knife could ever cut our love apart
In the dark I hear the night birds call
They just stand around and boast
As the night comes in a-fallin’
Well the future for me is already a thing of the past
Is when I’m alone with you
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
“Ah, think I’ll call it a sheep”
It's either one or the other or neither of the two
Born already ruined
Watch the plain clothes
I wish she’d unlock
The side that’s winning
It’s alright, Ma, I’m only sighing
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
Or define you or confine you
Then he started into dealing with slaves
It’s rough out there
And accept it that soon
Mama, don't you let me down
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make it
Good and bad, I define these terms
Or from the coast of Barcelona
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
It’s tough out there
They’d like to drive me from this town
I hear your name
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
Everybody says
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Her folks they said our lives together
Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
To shine in through
On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ
It’s well known
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait
And my happiness is o'er
See what you can do
There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Daylight sneakin’ through the window
Listen to me pretty baby
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I knew he’d lost control
Drag you down or drain you down
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
			Oh, I’m sailin’ away my own true love
Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die?
Don’t mind the driving rain
Though I’m younger than you
Them I will forget
New morning . . .										 
Have to make a fuss over me
The wind howls like a hammer
You may be the head of some big TV network
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
When I paint my masterpiece
And let others do for you
I don't have to wonder no more
Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse
Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”
			How many roads must a man walk down
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
By His grace I have been touched
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Through this weary world of woe
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Ever gonna take the place of you
			What good am I if I’m like all the rest
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
For the others to fire
With the tombstone blues										 
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
My love she speaks softly
You said you’d never compromise
But you’re doin’ it again
Can’t you feel that sun a-shinin’?
Like Judas of old
What you can’t understand
It hurts me all over, it doesn’t seem right
Another one of them endless days
To say you are my friend
I been all around the world, boys
Don’t stand in the doorway
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
Inside, the judge was stepping down
Singin’ just for you
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind
May your wishes all come true
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
You say you told me
The cat’s in the well and grief is showing its face
Any day now, any day now
Or select you or dissect you
All these people that you mention
He really wasn’t where it’s at
Come to me now, you know
About the same time He made the earth
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
Going through all these things twice
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
In the brightness of my day
			I can’t understand
Or else go home”
And your pleasure knows no limits
Now the wintertime is coming
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
In the ruins of your balcony
I killed a man back there
They whisper in the wings
I wish my mother was still alive
Now the moon is almost hidden
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
And it seems so unfair
I can be just like you
So happy just to be alive
You should be made
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
			Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law
Honey bees are buzzin’
Its iron claws attached
Then they bring them to the factory
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Get deathlike at times
With his memories in a trunk
And they lived in an alley under the red sky
It is made out of bricks
Draw conclusions on the wall
He saw an animal as smooth as glass
But like Louise always says
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free
Have they counted the cost it’ll take to bring down
Can you tell me who to contact here, señor?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
My love she’s like some raven
They must bust in early May
And I’m gonna let you pass
They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve
My mind weaves a symphony
That’s the way I remember her best.
You got a lotta nerve
I'm saying it plain
To say you got a helping hand to lend
Heart burnin' – still yearnin'
I want you, I want you
In the beginning, long time ago
Mixing up the medicine
Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof
They’ve got a parade permit and a police escort
Old memories of you to me have clung
Without any doubt
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape
It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds
Valentines can’t buy her
Cultivate their flowers to be
He saw an animal up on a hill
And you walked a rugged mile
Find out something only dead men know
That long black cloud is comin’ down
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay
He looked so immaculately frightful
You remember only about the brass ring
I know where I would go
And without further notice
			I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
			Spirit on the water 
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I used to be among the crowd
Now, you can train on down
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
Nobody can sing the blues
Ain’t goin’ nowhere fast
So darlin’, you better come through
At my window with a broken wing										 
I see you there
Tangled up in blue
A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
I just can’t fit
You know my baby will
I know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind
			When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
As she was walkin’ by the arcade
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I met one man who was wounded in love
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
			Go ’way from my window
Follow your own ambitions
To be just like them
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
One I can easily afford
I had something to protect
Well, I’m gonna quit this baby talk now
And shot it full of holes
It don’t even matter to me where you’re wakin’ up tomorrow
When you asked how I was doing
God knows it’s fragile
Finalize you or advertise you
Casanova is just being punished for going
Don’t my gal look fine
He could not keep
The trailing moss and mystic glow
I'll be drifting along
Distant ships sailing into the mist
God knows that when you see it
We drove that car as far as we could
Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
Crying out that he was framed
God say, “No.” Abe say, “What?”
Just take everything down to Highway 61
I'll avenge my father's death then I'll step back
No, no, no, it ain’t me, babe
But I don’t sense affection
An’ I have no sense of time
Buried under tobacco leaves
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
I know you always say that you agree
			Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
In the long black coat										 
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
Down in the easy chair!
One more cup of coffee for the road
Throughout the land
But all the while I was alone
“It takes one to know one,” she smiles
He’ll tell them to you when you’re asleep
Hang around a ink well
I been in a brawl
I don’t want to fake you out
Don’t wanna be with nobody tonight
Like I see through the water
The world has gone black before my eyes
I had so little time to fail
Must be, and that is all
Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man
			Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith
They’ll stone you and then say you are brave
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
  
The stars above the barren trees
Girl by the whirlpool
My sister, she ran off and got married
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
Bringin’ me all of your charms
In the dime stores and bus stations
Didn’t I, didn’t I try to care?
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You want me to believe
Creeping it's way into my gut 
I got nothin’ to say, ’specially about whatever was
Read books, repeat quotations
By His truth I can be upright
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Tailgates and substitutes
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Which opened up his heart
It's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
Broken bottles, broken plates
To the tree with roots
Before he can hear people cry?
Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
I’m gazing out the window
It's gonna be your own fault
Ring bell, hard to tell
Can't explain 
My love winks, she does not bother
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
To be such a freak?”
Broken hands on broken ploughs
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
I used to care, but things have changed
May you always be courageous
You won’t regret it
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Take the rag away from your face
You know, I don’t mind him cheatin’ on me
Well, you walk into the room
She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
If you really believe that
I ain’t lookin’ to block you up
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
Don’t put on any airs
Strap yourself
This kind of love I’m so sick of it
I’d gladly confess
Get your mind off wintertime
Nothin' but the moon and stars
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys
As young people’s blood
Watch out he don’t fall on you
As she showed them to the people from next door
Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
To satisfy, insure you not to quit
And though her eyes are fixed upon
But now something has changed
			When you’re lost in the rain in Juarez
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
And you’re thinkin’ of me
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
You may be a state trooper, you might be a young Turk
You can bust your feet
And salt for salt
You play with my world
Now you're content to let the days go by
			Crickets are chirpin’, the water is high
I guess I should have known
I only mean it for the best
Or maybe it’s the weather or something like that
Real dirty face and a curly tail
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
Salute her when her birthday comes
Your babies are crying louder
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
The drifter did escape										   
You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
His closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand
The clouds are turnin’ crimson–the leaves fall from the limbs an’
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I’m just going down the road feeling bad
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
With the rain blowing in your hair?
You do so at the peril of your own life
She once was a true love of mine
If anything is goin’ to sell
I got a cravin’ love for blazing speed
You could ride like Annie Oakley
The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Or you don’t dance at all”
I’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can’t control
You say you’re lookin' for someone
When you go your way and I go mine
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
			God knows you ain’t pretty
Am I still dreamin’ yet?
A saxophone someplace far off played
Of the St. James Hotel
While my conscience explodes
He been suckin’ the blood out of the genius of generosity
I'm blinded by the colors I see
Oh, this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though
“Have Mercy on His Soul”
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
And just for that one moment
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
I found my world, found my world in you
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
She said that all the railroad men
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t
Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,
An’ he just smoked my eyelids
Don’t wear sandals
Well, I have had some rotten nights
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
You might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread
I’d ask him what the matter was
They will crush you with wealth and power
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
I’m younger than that now										 
True love needs no company
I’m so glad you’re my boy!”
You forgot to close the garage door
I get my sweet reward
I’m a-thinkin’ and a-wond’rin’ all the way down the road
You have no idea what you do to me
His voice it trembles as he calls out
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Romeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion
Is tell me that it isn’t true
No, and I ain’t lookin’ to fight with you
Now if you see Saint Annie
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
Before you call him a man?
How can I live for You?
So glad
Sleep is like a temporary death
			You have given everything to me
There is no sense in trying
From my toes up to my ears
Like a rolling stone?
Although the masters make the rules
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen
Headin’ for another joint
Genghis Khan
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
So don’t think twice, it’s all right
But it doesn’t matter
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
Just like a mattress balances
In the pale afternoon
			Oh, the ragman draws circles
Don’t the sun look good
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day 
That you’re holdin’ in your hand
In the end
The wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it
There are no mistakes in life some people say
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
Like Blind Willie McTell
			Down along the cove
Outside, the crowd was stirring
By the big pen
The cat’s in the well, and Papa is reading the news
It sure is good to see you comin’ today"
Listen to the fiddler play
I’ll always thank the Lord
			’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
Down to New Orleans
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
You’re gonna have to serve somebody
’Cause I don’t think about it
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
And the fire that burns in it
Man gave names to all the animals
I’m gonna spare the defeated, boys, I’m going to speak to the crowd
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
You don’t have to worry anymore
And says, “How does it feel
You ain’t got no sense, no how
And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
But, oh, what kind of love is this
’Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face?
But yes I think it can be very easily done
Proud ’neath heated brow
What good am I?										 
Well, I sailed through the storm
I don’t care about economy
I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all
And your gravity fails
It’s a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
Stripes on your shoulders
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
Why you can't treat me right
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship
For as long as love will last
It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall										 
You can say it just as good.
Had to be held down by big police
The Phantom of the Opera
Oh, even that couldn’t make me go back
Wrapped around my head
I’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
On Desolation Row
Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around
The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Well, he puts his cigar
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
For the wheel’s still in spin
Your daddy he’s an outlaw
Wiggle ’til you’re high, wiggle ’til you’re higher
			Just like old Saxophone Joe
You feel to moan but unlike before
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ’em bad enough
When I was down
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
You that build the big bombs
So I’m going
Don't know what work even means 
You’re gonna get hit
The Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies
It was raining from the first
You always act surprised
Hollis Brown
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
I’m countin’ on you love, to give me a break
Goin’ down over the sea?
But mama, you been on my mind
Couldn’t hear the robin sing
And you go watch the geek
All and all can only fall
I’m hungry and I’m irritable
Life without you 
You raise up your head
I wasn’t born to lose you
How I wish you were here to see 
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
At times I think there are no words
To see you										 
I won’t come here no more if it bothers you
I’ll say, “It’s easily done
I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard ’em too
The fog is so thick that you can’t even spy the land
You have given me life to live
			Hollis Brown
You’re going to Sodom and Gomorrah
To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone
That’s how it is when things disintegrate
And it’s alright, Ma, I can make it
Tell me that it isn’t true										 
Or inspect you or reject you
“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
Seen a shooting star tonight
I was thinkin’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
The night passed away so quickly
She seems too far out
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
And he says, “Here is your throat back
			Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin' to be so quiet?
But the time has come
Shall pass as your senses will rise
He’s not sentimental—don’t bother him at all
			Crash on the levee, mama
If you ever made it through
That the finishin’ end is at hand
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
From their fates try to resign
And I try to harmonize with songs
Supplied with sleep
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
He saw an animal that liked to growl
Every day your memory grows dimmer
He asks you with a grin
I’m going off into the woods, I’m huntin’ bare
I’d go crawling down the avenue
The world’s being slaughtered and it’s such a bloody disgrace
There’s seven breezes a-blowin’
Shinin’ through the trees?
Beyond here lies nothin'
Couldn’t even see the floor
Some people never worked a day in their life
			We carried you in our arms
I was born here and I’ll die here against my will
“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
On Independence Day
And revolution in the air
What good am I if I know and don’t do
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
The sun is shining, ain’t but one train on this track
Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine
For deep in my heart
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
When I’m alone with you
Is just equality in school
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
			I’ll remember you
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
The night is so long and the table is oh, so full
When all of your advisers heave their plastic
Leaves are rustlin’ in the wood—things are fallin’ off the shelf
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Shut the light, shut the shade
If you lean your head out far enough
If you wanna learn anything
To win friends and influence his uncle
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
Meantime life outside goes on
When it’s you who must keep it satisfied
“Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know
These memories I got, they can strangle a man
The cloak and dagger dangles
When the game got rough
But old, young, age don’t carry weight
He asks you how it feels
I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you
But it looks like it don’t
The order is rapidly fadin’
Now, don't you try an' move me
This love could tear me in two
Well, I wake in the morning
Social clubs in drag disguise
But this is ten times worse”
The country music station plays soft
Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put
I'll drag ‘em all down to hell and I'll stand ‘em at the wall
There’s not much more to be said
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
			If dogs run free, then why not we
Alone you stand with nobody near
Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck
God don’t call it treason
There’s a kingdom called Heaven
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
You put your eyes in your pocket
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
The cowboy angel rides
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
It’s you and you only I been thinking about
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
in the same breath
Put some sugar in my bowl
Who immediately walks up to you
As I look around this world all that I’m finding
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Buy me a flute
Like a camel and then you frown
With a note in his hand which read
It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe										 
Keeping away from the women
“Ah, think I’ll call it a cow”
There's no one here, the gardener is gone
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse
Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’
To be alone with you
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
May you grow up to be true
It depends on how I’m a-feelin’
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
			Seen a shooting star tonight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
There’s a rumbling in the skies
Me with my belt
This wheel’s on fire
Will there be any comfort there, señor?
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Ain’t it clear that—
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
And a gun that shoots
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train
Don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president
True love they’ve been without it
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had										 
I can’t shoot them anymore
The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
Everything inside is made of stone
You can’t turn back—you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
That he’s in
Stapled to his chest
But this time I’m not gonna tell you why that is
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
I’m just glad it’s over
And my best friend, my doctor
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
			Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes
Maggie says that many say
You better go back to from where you came
But I mean no harm nor put fault
You ain’t goin’ nowhere
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
The other was just railroad gin
Like pendulums swinging on chains
Make everything from toy guns that spark
They waste your nights and days
			Throw my ticket out the window
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
At the close of the day
Blame it on a simple twist of fate										 
Well, if you wanna see the sun rise
Who’ll pick you up each time you fall
Across the swooping plain?
A world I never knew
Well, he hands you a nickel
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
When he’s playin’ ’til the break of day
And I, I don’t mind the pain
To be with the one you love
Temptation’s page flies out the door
Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal
			There was a wicked messenger
Oh please send you a friend
You can tell by the way she smiles
 
On bad terms with the younger men
I’m just sittin’ here thinking
Your cracked country lips
They say that you’re planning to put me down
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Praying to the powers above
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
But your love just hasn’t proved true
Mutiny from stern to bow
Making you feel
I’m puttin’ out your eyes
I long to reach for you in the night
I am goin’ to teach peace to the conquered
You can hear the school bell ring
Bring that bottle over here
I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
So it may flow and be
The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star”
Tangled up in blue										 
Lay your hand upon my head
You that build the death planes
Deceived me into thinking
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
With his friend, a jealous monk
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
If dogs run free										 
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vines
Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
The cat’s in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump
			I ain’t lookin’ to compete with you
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly
She speaks good English
They tell you, “Time is money,” as if your life was worth its weight in gold
Honey, I want you										 
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues										 
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
			Down the street the dogs are barkin’
To gather flowers constantly
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
At the end of the trail
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall
And I don’t really care
I’m sittin’ at the welcome table, I’m so hungry I could eat a horse
But I sure wish he’d take that off his head
It's been so long
There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
We were goin’ to meet again and wait
And offered me a pipe
Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
What it was that I’ve done wrong”
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive
			You walk into the room
What can I say
My conscience is beginning to bother me today
Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
With you perfectly
May you always do for others
Heart burnin', still yearnin' 
And everybody’s shouting
Lookin’ for a new friend
I was goin’ to confiscate your lace
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
Yes, ’n’ how many deaths will it take till he knows
But you’re gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
Tomorrow will be 
He hears the ticking of the clocks
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Now, I’ve just got to cut loose
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
			As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
Proud to steal her anything she sees
I’m preachin’ the Word of God
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
Don’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
Other kinda lover
Where my love and I have laid
For he that gets hurt
While preachers preach of evil fates
It takes a thief to catch a thief
What made them want to come and blow you away?										 
The only thing I knew how to do
Blow into my face with scorn
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams
Without your love I’d be nowhere at all
Streets are filled with broken hearts
A foreign sound to your ear
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down 
About Desolation Row
For the times they are a-changin’										 
I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan
			Gonna change my way of thinking
Deciding America’s future from Amsterdam and to Paris
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
They say low wages are a reality
He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed
Ain’t no use jiving
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
And because time was on his side
You follow, find yourself at war
They need somewhere to go
Throw my ticket out the window
Advertising signs they con
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
I traveled through East Texas
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
And I would send a message
An’ though the rules of the road have been lodged
I remember her whispering yet
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather
We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me ’til everything gets real
And you just sittin’ there
There’s some people that
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
For another plate of food
As the present now
As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall
He’s lookin’ for the fuse
But everybody still talks about
Sometimes you can't give it away 
She made well sure her neighbors understood
Get jailed, jump bail
Too noble to neglect
I’m going
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
I’m rollin’ slow, goin’ where the wild roses grow
Why must I always be the thief?
Every waking moment you could crack
Another best friend, somehow
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s makin’ me feel afraid
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
Judge says to the High Sheriff,
Someday little girl, you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoe
From the place that I’ll be landing?
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray
When questioned who had sent for him
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
That I’ve still got a dream that hasn’t been repossessed
			Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
With a time-rusted compass blade
To the old folks home and the college
On this new morning, new morning
Too much paperwork
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee										 
And yes, I believe you do
That’s what they explain to me
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
God knows there’s a purpose
Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line
Frighten you or tighten you
It must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two A.M. booty call
She says, "look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants.
They say that nighttime is the right time
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
They say prayer has the power to help
Into Desolation Row
Simplify you, classify you
What good am I while you softly weep
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Madams light the candles
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
			Well, I’m stranded in the city that never sleeps
You have laid down Your life for me
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
As Lady and I look out tonight
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
You burned your way into my heart 
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
And were taking him away
And you ask, “Is this where it is?”
Sheiks walkin’ around like kings
You just pick anyone
Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble
God say, “You can do what you want Abe, but
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
The lonesome organ grinder cries
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Then time will tell who fell
To the wedding of his son
And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh
The lonesome sparrow sings
			Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Who would remember better then you
I’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t heal
You know it’s not like that
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
May you stay forever young										 
On the back of the fish truck that loads
I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
Hear that undertaker’s bell
When the truth’s in our hearts and we still don’t believe?
When you go your way and I go mine										  
My woman got a face like a teddy bear
Well, you must tell me, baby
Yes, ’n’ how many years can some people exist
And your father to your sister he explains
She’s tossin’ a baseball bat in the air
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
And someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve
If dogs run free, why not me
I was raised in the country, I been workin’ in the town
Whatever you gonna do
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
What he don’t know to begin with
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
The door has closed forevermore 
Among the lumberjacks
I and I
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir is beginning to sing
Well, I’m crying to the Lord—I’m tryin’ to be meek and mild
If not for you
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane
One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
I always knew
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup
Who looked so fine at first
			Bye and bye, I’m breathin’ a lover’s sigh
I know the reason
And now I know you’re dissatisfied
The human mind can only stand so much
Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rent
They’re spoonfeeding Casanova
He stayed behind the assembly hall
I need somethin’ strong to distract my mind
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong
Do you, Mister Jones?
Unto the shoeless hunter who’s gone deaf
There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
They’ll stone ya when you are young and able
The handmade blade, the child’s balloon
You’ve been with the professors
“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”
Lot of things can get in the way when you’re tryin’ to do what’s right
Rain would gather too
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Both agreeing it was best
Mama, don't you make a sound
On a bottle of wine
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
You say you lost your faith
Anyway they already expect you
I ain’t looking for nothing in anyone’s eyes
I’m sailin’ away in the morning
I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
Pay for your ticket and don't complain
I think you will find
But we’re gonna let it
I was dreaming I was sleepin' in Rosie’s bed
Because he took you for a ride
I’m just breathin’ to myself, pretendin’ not that I don’t know
God knows it could snap apart right now
			Close your eyes, close the door
It's just as plain as it can be
There’s nothin’ I wish to be ownin’
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose
The voice of praise
Sometimes no one wants what we got
			Precious angel, under the sun
God sees it all unfold
Mama, you been on my mind
I cannot move
I catch a lot, sometimes too many
I’m not the one you need
Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?”
I've been trampling through mud
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it
Brag about it all over town
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
			Down over the window
And I won’t let go and I can’t let go, won’t let go
For she ain’t the same
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
Well don’t know which one is worse
How does it feel
It was you who understood
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Is there any truth in that, señor?
The old men ’round here, sometimes they get
Graveyards, false gods, I scuff
I started out on burgundy
			God don’t make no promises that He don’t keep
			Come you masters of war
It doesn’t matter inside the Gates of Eden
Time is pilin’ up, we struggle and we scrape
How much do I know
Please see if she’s wearing a coat so warm
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
You broke a heart that loved you
“Equality,” I spoke the word
Have died in battle or in vain
And man they expect the same
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
He said, “He who is not for Me is against Me”
You might say that I’m young
“It’s his”
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Talkin’ that the heat put
Try to be a success
Keep a clean nose
An’ evidently she won’t
They walked along by the old canal
What good are you anyway, if you can’t stand up to some old businessman?
Her profession’s her religion
Through the back alleys—through the blinds
But your heart is like an ocean
I’m not that eager to make a mistake
			If you find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
			Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
That they do not respect in any degree
And I’ll rock you too
With his candle lit into the sun
Soul to soul, our shadows roll
And always tell him, “No?”
Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one
I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
Unthought of, though, somehow
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance
The meat is so tough you can’t cut it with a sword
Wherever I am welcome is where I’ll be
Then he said, “Jump right in”
Wants to get it paid off
Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain
Rolling down the road
God don’t call it wrong
Lookin’ for a new fool
Where I happened to be employed
There’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June
The moon gives light and shines by night
Around you have grown
You were trying to break into another world
While money doesn’t talk, it swears
People are expecting a false peace to come
Don’t steal, don’t lift
You must pick up one or the other
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
Even though my mind is hazy an’ my thoughts they might be narrow
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
’Neath her Panamanian moon
I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose
I don’t mean trouble, please don’t put me down or get upset
I spied my little bundle of joy
And I thought of you
When He said, “Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize?
Wiggle ’til the moon sees you
I’ve heard you say many times
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Don’t the moon look good, mama
Fighting in the captain’s tower
If there’s anyone that knows
It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
An’ like a fool I mixed them
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out lying in the mud
Strapped to the mast
			Shadows are falling and I’ve been here all day
A brave man will kill you with a sword, a coward with a kiss
Gate won’t close
Take a woman like your kind
Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away
The judge, he holds a grudge
That somebody thinks they really found you
Leaving men wholly, totally free
It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe
To memorizing politics
But I never did like it all that much
He pushed the table over to protect his family
To curbs ’neath holes where babies wail
They say lose your inhibitions
Down every street there's a window
Relationships of ownership
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
The most unfortunate circumstances?
God knows how to make it flow
The lamppost stands with folded arms
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
Wiggle ’til you vomit fire
Didn’t I take chances?
Something else just hit the ground
With twenty pounds of headlines
They’re throwing knives into the tree
All that false instruction
Is strapped across their shoulders
May you always know the truth
I believe in you when winter turn to summer
When the fast bullets fly
It’s all just a dream, babe
Whether you are right or wrong
In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
To just give a check
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
			If your mem’ry serves you well
And if you hear vague traces of skippin’ reels of rhyme
Into a life of continual crime
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
You’ll never be greater than yourself”
Put my best foot forward, stop being influenced by fools
			Well, today has been a sad ol’ lonesome day
As the evening sky grew dark
Told the first father that things weren’t right
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord
You will not die, it’s not poison”
Lost your power of recall 
We’re both just one too many mornings
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not”
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
It’s too hot to sleep, time is running away
I don’t carry deadweight—I’m no flash in the pan
You that hide behind walls
Vanished from my hand
Now, I want you to know that while we watched
She was married when we first met
Shine your light, shine your light on me
I’m sure your heart is not with me
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
You’re a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
As the last fire truck from hell
My bride’s gonna come
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
Crumble into one another
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
“Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
An’ left me here facing the wall
The same thing I want from you today
But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only										 
From now on I’ll be busy
Nobody has to guess
But there’s one thing I know
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
Light yourself a candle
Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory
The kingdoms of Experience
The rats have got your flour
You cut to the core
Gonna give you another chance
For the loser now will be later to win
It’s gettin’ dark, too dark for me to see
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Who says she knows me well
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
If I had wings and I could fly
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
This place don’t make sense to me no more
Yes, I’m so glad
The blessings of tranquility
You prayed to the Lord above
Things fall to pieces in my face
An’ wouldn’t it be my luck
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends
Jolene, Jolene     
You that build all the guns
Right outside of Delacroix
Lift up your eyes
Ah, but I was so much older then
Got a hopped-up Mustang Ford
After poisoning him with words
Now you would not think to look at him
			Crimson flames tied through my ears
You may be somebody’s mistress, may be somebody’s heir
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be										 
My toes too numb to step
This wheel shall explode!										 
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts
An’ I gaze back to the street
The stars are beginning to hide
And it’s Eastertime too
And stop being influenced by fools
There’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lot
I think it will fit me like a glove
For threatening my baby
Were fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiary
That carry around a fire hose
So take heed, take heed of the western wind
You only got ten
Wears a cloak of decency
You into thinking you’re the one
Spanish boots of Spanish leather										 
They got some hungry women there
Wiggle ’til it answers, wiggle ’til it comes
			I’ve just reached a place
But users, cheaters
But he’s badly built
By the saving grace that’s over me
Says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”
“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”
I told her I didn’t really care
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck
			Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
But it looks like you won’t
We learn to live and then we forgive
An’ a thousand miles behind
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
You’ve been through all of
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
You got the key to my brain 
That last night I was with
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Down along the cove
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
If she ain’t feelin’ well
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
Watch the parkin’ meters
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way
And You’ve chosen me to be among the few
Thank You, Lord										 
For tonight when I’ll be staying here with you
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door										 
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Gonna break the roof in—set fire to the place as a parting gift
			I have heard rumors all over town
Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new
He crosses himself
Cinderella, she seems so easy
Where you been don’t bother me nor bring me down in sorrow
You don’t forget
Your voice is like a meadowlark
Not unless you mail them
There ought to be a law
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
That you’re better ’n no one
And that failure’s no success at all
			In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
To every conceivable point of view”
I just can’t beg you anymore
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
To try and make me change my mind and stay
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead										 
See the ghosts of slavery ships
Emptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe”
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
What God has given to us no man can take away
Freed me from the pit
At ships with tattooed sails
Your loyalty is not to me
You see me on the street
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
What good am I if I say foolish things
Don’t know how it looked to other people
Mysterious and dark
Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
From the west unto the east
Each one wishing for what the other has got
			If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
And scratched your name in sand
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
Saved
I’m all dressed up, I’m going to the county dance
“Which Side Are You On?”
That it is not he or she or them or it
It's all true, everything you have heard 
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Sugar Baby get on down the road
Mama’s in the fact’ry
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”
With all the ring-dancin’ Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
May you grow up to be righteous
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try
I feel like laying down
You can’t make love all by yourself										 
Abe says, “Man, you must be puttin’ me on”
Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
The country doctor rambles
’Cause I don’t be like they’d like me to
It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
From the boat I fish for bullheads
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
We’ll go out and see it sometime
You're gonna have to find yourself
Passed this way an hour ago
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
No, there’s nothin’ you can send me, my own true love
But it’s not that way
With the one who tries to hide
To find out if she’s talked
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
You think I'm over the hill
That we were meant to be more than friends 
When the winds of changes shift
Is that I’m seeing the real you at last
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
Mean old twister bearing down on me
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk
I been walkin’ the road
I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide
I rode with him in a taxi once
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed
But ev’rybody else, even yourself
But I see through your eyes
It’s bad for your health, he said
All except inside the Gates of Eden
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
Open up the gate for you
That not much is really sacred
And then say God bless him
And paint the daytime black
And I’ll stand o’er your grave
You’re gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
I’m so glad
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
It doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
But you’d better lift your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it babe
Yes, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
You will not hear a laugh
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
I’m a-wonderin’ if she remembers me at all
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The flowers of the city
Come closer
When you knew I had some other place to be
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
Now there’s spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men
Dodging lions and wastin’ time
Underneath the sky of blue
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
A perfect image of a priest
I don’t have much to say
Now at midnight all the agents
Settin’ my dial on the radio
It’s like I ain’t here
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
You made it there somehow
To be on your own
Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Honey, I want you
Don’t let me drift too far
Using all the devices under the sun
Got their noses to the grindstones
But don’t think twice, it’s all right
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
Between stayin’ and returnin’
From Desolation Row										 
Ever since we’ve been apart										 
But it grieves my heart, love
In the great unknown
Now I'm feeling the wall
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
The cat’s in the well, leaves are starting to fall
Everybody is making love
Or have done something wrong
When Ruthie says come see her
Is your money that good
She lit a burner on the stove
Where I can watch her waltz for free
They’ll stone you when you are walking home
People on the platforms
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
Jesus is calling, He’s coming back to gather up his jewels
I’m gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
I’ll tell you something, things you never had you’ll never miss
Well, God is in His heaven
And but for the sky there are no fences facin’
I could hold you for a million years
I've already confessed – no need to confess again 
If your time to you is worth savin’
You been so bold and so cold
You were the answer to my prayer
Oh, your love comes on so strong
Now I'm all worn down by weepin'
Not much happenin’ here, nothin’ ever does
They’ll stone ya just a-like they said they would
I’m in love with my second cousin
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Speak jealously of them that are free
I want to be with you any way I can
I’m sure your mind is roamin’
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
True love can make a blade of grass
Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon
You knew that we would meet again
			Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
He said every man’s conscience is vile and depraved
Rollin’ high and mighty traps
You’re the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night
If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to go home
Right now I can’t read too good
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand
What do I care?
It doesn’t haunt me like it did before
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind
			Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Has even taken all her things inside
And you know it’s true
My old man, he’s like some feudal lord
Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down 
Everybody that was hangin’ out
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
I still wish to kiss
But she breaks just like a little girl
But I don’t know what “all right” even means
			Well you're comin' down High Street, walkin' in the sun
Propaganda, all is phony
How many letters they sent
I'm movin' after midnight
Babe, I couldn’t find the door
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
			Stake my future on a hell of a past
When I’m all alone
Honey, I know where
			They’re selling postcards of the hanging
I can see that your head
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
Tweedle-dee Dee—he’s on his hands and his knees
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
Like you never did before
By His spirit I’ve been sealed
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
The man in the coon-skin cap
He’ll teach you how to pick and choose
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
Sometimes I wonder 
The dogs’ll lose their bark
Walkin’ to and fro beneath the moon
He was tryin’ to create a next world war
I’ll be your baby tonight										 
Get away from these demagogues
And reciting the alphabet
“Ah, think I’ll call it a pig”
Silver and gold
She was workin’ in a topless place
On her twenty-second birthday
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!
Tell me that it isn’t true
Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone
Might as well keep going now										 
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
Everybody must get stoned
Though breathlike
I’ll remember you										 
He saw milk comin’ out but he didn’t know how
They seem determined to go all the way
And after ev’ry plan had failed
While evening slips away
But right now I’ll just sit here so contentedly
Wait for the mornin’ light
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile										 
And wait for succeeding kings
May your feet always be swift
But left looking just like a ghost
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
Have fallen from her curls
Where the willow don’t bend
And climb on every rung
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself										 
There’s a Man up on a cross and He’s been crucified
That while life’s pleasures be few
Today I'll stand in faith and raise
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Flung down by corpse evangelists
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
They’re lying low and they’re makin’ hay
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee 
Slip away										 
Took a woman like you
Ah get born, keep warm
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
As some warn victory, some downfall
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
			You got a lotta nerve
On this new morning with you
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules
Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn’t be seen by men
You may be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-sized bed
			Ramona
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
I believe in you
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
At a Baltimore hotel society gath’rin’
I got love for you and it’s all in vain
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
Just do what you think you should do
You're something nice, I'm gonna grab my dice
By the blood of the lamb
Plants in the bed but
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright
Like some mystery
I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
Bury the rag deep in your face
Fold my hands and pray for rain
It’s easy to see without looking too far
Please do it fast
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
That runs in your veins
I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Broken treaties, broken vows
Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters
It’s the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
Look out kid
They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”
“I want him dead or alive
I see your lover-man comin’—comin’ ’cross the barren field
Preacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave
Walkin' through the leaves, falling from the trees
And your long-time curse hurts
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
The bright spark of the steady lights
An’ anyway I’m not alone
I don’t want to meet your kin
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Can’t help but wonder what’s happenin’ to my companions
I can make it through
What good am I?
Someone to close his eyes for you
You walk the floor and wonder why
Every little detail
I’m on the pavement
I never wanted to go back there—I’d rather have died
			Standing on the waters casting your bread
Getting light outside, the temperature dropped
Can you tell me what we’re waiting for, señor?										 
Well, the road’s washed out—weather not fit for man or beast
Bring me my boots and shoes
My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime
You make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one
Sometimes must have to stand naked
Of ev’ry man who put me here
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it gets late
Join the army, if you fail
God knows it’s out of sight
But now mornin’s clear
Don’t send me no more letters, no
It was supposed to last a season
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I shall be released
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful
But I don’t feel alone
I’m going to do whatever circumstances require
Take the motherless children off the street 
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
I promise to go under it
Now, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
Can’t you hear that motor turnin’?
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
She had to sell everything she owned
You just want to be on
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
Please heed the call
But goodbye’s too good a word, gal
May you stay forever young
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
Señor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather
You fasten the triggers
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Grandpa died last week
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself
They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ to the door
I got my hammer ringin’, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t goin’ down
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved
I’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey—I’ll die before I turn senile
But I would not feel so all alone
I’m still trying to get used to
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
And the day is a-gettin’ dark
Made of silver or of golden
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear
Just drink up your blood like wine
He lived on the outside of town
			They say ev’rything can be replaced
A cold coyote calls
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
			Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
Twelfth Street and Vine
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
I wouldn’t pay it any mind
I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word
Someone hit me from behind
But you don’t know what it is
Hear me singin’ through these tears
You ain’t worth the blood
Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go
My dear sweet friend
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
But the Pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
He’s gonna call on you
Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire
There’s not even room enough to be anywhere
Boys in the street beginning to play
Politician got on his jogging shoes
And give them all another name
And you’re so kind
I been playin’ it straight
From across that lonesome ocean
Goodness hides behind its gates
I’m not even acquainted with my own desires
Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone
She said, “Boy, without a doubt
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
They’re painting the passports brown
I can see through your masks
The storms are raging on the rollin’ sea
Soon to be divorced
“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said
Too serious to fool
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Shock or knock or lock you up
While the jury cried for more
If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound
From phony jealousy
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
But with the country to where you’re goin’
You say, “How are you?” “Good luck”
And she takes your voice
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
On seven shotgun shells
The last thing you said before you hit the street
Take heed of the stormy weather
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down										 
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
Makin’ love to you
Just you and me
You can hurt someone and not even know it
Your sorrow does stem
All their earthly principles they’re gonna have to abandon?
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk
I’m paintin’ the town making my last go-round
And you say, “What’s mine?”
Now the rainman gave me two cures
It’s the last temptation, the last account
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
Every time you leave and go off someplace
I’ve seen enough heartaches and strife
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
Never was heard of any more
You may be living in another country under another name
Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
To wait upon him hand and foot
That anybody's seen
Everybody got to move somewhere
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
She gave her heart to the man
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
You know it balances on your head
My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
She wears an iron vest
Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw
The love that a stranger might receive
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Waiting for the trains
All that’s gold isn’t meant to shine
She said, “Lord, have mercy, honey
And I thought of me
To think I’d make contact
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
That sparkles before she speaks
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
And negativity don’t pull you through
Well, I’m standin’ on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the King
Go melt back into the night, babe
But you’re gonna have to serve somebody
Funny, how the things you have the hardest time parting with
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Must I always be the thief?
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
Well, I don’t deserve it but I sure did make it through
Just then a bolt of lightning
I think the rain has stopped
I’ll come and be cryin’ to you										 
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
I hurt easy, I just don’t show it
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
My sky would fall
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Though it shadows metal badge
Well, you look so pretty in it
			John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
What happens next
And I’ve never gotten used to it, I’ve just learned to turn it off
Lot of things they’d like they would never buy
Her voice once an’ talk
You must know about my debutante”
An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
			Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense
One look at you and I’m out of control
Come out and round up everyone
Got to get you out of my miserable brain
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees
And they were both out on Highway 61
All I really want to do
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Now you don’t seem so proud
They’re doing the double shuffle, they’re throwin’ sand on the floor
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
			My love she speaks like silence
It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there										 
In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
The Judge is coming in, everybody rise
And admit that the waters
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
ALTERNATE VERSION
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
With the Memphis blues again
			Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
But there's no one here that's left to tell
I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will be he who has stalled
At seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand
If your mem’ry served you well
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
That you’d have liked me to
Some things are too terrible to be true
All good people are praying
We live and we die, we know not why
I watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on
You can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold
Obscenity, who really cares
			I’m walking through streets that are dead
And I just turn my back while you silently die
And they really make a mess outta you
It’s somethin’ you did
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
And on the highway of regret
Wherever you roam
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
The line it is drawn
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated
Baby I am the king and you're the queen										 
You could hear it from the door
Well the leaves are rustlin’ in the wood—things are fallin’ off of the shelf
And for Christmas, buy her a drum										 
’Til I’m sure that you’re dead										 
You better chew gum
But this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though
He hands you a dime
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing 
I can hear a lover's breath
			She’s got everything she needs
You don't remember at all
People are crazy and times are strange
Was that some kind of joke?
I got the porkchops, she got the pie
Of any circumstance
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Some things are too hot to touch
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
Discuss what’s real and what is not
Is Cinderella sweeping up
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
Gargles in the rat race choir
I had so much left to do
When the death count gets higher
If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do
I was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain
Got both eyes tight shut
I’ll take you cross the river dear
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war
And no one is better ’n you
I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
She’s got everything she needs
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
She’s the brains behind pa
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
It ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
You to me were true
There’s an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck
We’ll climb that hill no matter how steep
That called on me to call on them
You have given me eyes to see
You that hide behind desks
			The guilty undertaker sighs
The carpet, too, is moving under you
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, “All is well”
Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginnin’ to shake
Hand me down my walkin' cane
Horns on his head and they weren’t too short
Oh what dear daughter ’neath the sun
Tie me on ’er and turn her loose
And now you’d throw us all aside
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
We can have a whoppin' good time										 
My love she laughs like the flowers
And talk with my chambermaid
Well the Lord created it, mister
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow
Everything passes
			Our conversation was short and sweet
If indeed there ever was a door										  
Said, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing”
The times we knew
Baby I am the king and you're the queen
Two big bags of dead man’s bones
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
She put down in writing what was in her mind
“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met
Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
That you know I believe are true
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
You better leave”
Chain you down or bring you down
Girls’ faces formed the forward path
Like a walking shadow in my brain
That I was just a puppet in a play
And careful not to go to her too soon
Babe, I’d lay awake all night
You got a face that begs for love 
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say 
Where the neon madmen climb
Without ideals or violence
With no direction home
That can ever be hurled
Your sons and your daughters
I scarcely feel the glow
Out to where the trucks are rollin’ slow
They say ev’ry man needs protection
You’re right from your side
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
Check to see that nobody is escaping
You might be a rock ’n’ roll addict prancing on the stage
You never understood that it ain’t no good
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
Some are carpenters’ wives
All except for Cain and Abel
On a hot summer day, hot summer lawn
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Rabbit runnin’ down across the road
I'm trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
That’s hangin’ on the wall
I’m gonna establish my rule through civil war
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
For that’s all I’m wishin’ to be ownin’
Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove
All that foreign oil controlling American soil
Everything is broken
For the times they are a-changin’
The one was Texas medicine
And froze up inside
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
Thunder rolling over Clarkesdale, everything is looking blue
			When the rain is blowing in your face
Like Blind Willie McTell										 
And he dropped his medals down into her hand										 
Why wait any longer for the one you love
If I was a master thief
The cat’s in the well and the servant is at the door
Look out the saints are comin’ through
But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out
As someone who has had you on his mind										 
Is, baby, be friends with you										 
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
She said she would never forget
The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
God knows it’s terrifying
By this time I’d-a thought I would be sleeping
The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Things are breakin’ up out there
We’re so low
Now his nurse, some local loser
They say times are hard, if you don’t believe it
Now, I’ve just got to go
Nothin' we can call our own
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
When I asked him why he dressed
He spoke to me, I took his flute
And leaves you howling at the moon
And I’ll go last
Yes, I just wanna see
You cast your spell and I went under
“I’ve had too much of your company,”
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
From the dark room of his mind
I’ll close my eyes and I wonder
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen
They will lay you low
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin’ boy she could destroy
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
My senses have been stripped, my hands can’t feel to grip
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?										 
Walking, walking with you in my head
Like it’s your little toy
About man and God and law
Don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read
And handed it to me
You were my first love and you will be my last
Broken dishes, broken parts
Look up, look up—seek your Maker—’fore Gabriel blows his horn
These ties are strong enough to bind
Everything is broken										   
Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence
Morning came and morning went
Still I wish there was somethin’ you would do or say
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side
Do you, Mister Jones?										 
It was you who came right through
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
You’d rather see me paralyzed
That are drivin’ me insane
At pettiness which plays so rough
To stay away from the train line
And then he clicks his high heels
Well, they’ll stone you and say that it’s the end
And I hope that you die
Broken switches, broken gates
I can’t tell my heart that you’re no good
I never slept with her even once
Bertha Mason shook it—broke it
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war
I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama
“His Master’s voice is calling me”
That she’s the same one
But you’re always what I’m thinkin’ of
Shouting the word “NOW”
And we all want what’s his
Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, I’m using ’em all
Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ on the floor
She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
The sources of this hidden pain
Mama, put my guns in the ground
Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinkin' fast
People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall”
Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do
Will later be fast
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing
She’s delicate and seems like the mirror
So happy just to see you smile
Never weak but always strong
Before they’re forever banned?
But the town has no need to be nervous
			What’s the matter with me
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
I can't stay away 
A tear came to his eye
Your empty pockets tell yuh
High on the hill 
And sit before it gets too late
You discover that you’d just be one more
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’
I’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fade
I’m not sorry for nothin’ I’ve done
Didn’t I, didn’t I try to love you?
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
You’re a big girl all the way
Don’t wanna be a bum
I’d give anything to be with you										 
Coffins droppin’ in the street
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
And life is brief										  
Guess I owe You some kind of apology
I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
Don’t think twice, it’s all right
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you
All his kings
Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin’
While I was sleeping
			You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
No gratitude or love
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
You might have drugs at your command, women in a cage
Bye and bye, on you I’m casting my eye
And you’re sick of all this repetition
But I know what he really loves you for
And the princess and the prince
And watch the river flow										 
What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Didn’t I sleep, didn’t I weep beside you
I’ll be your baby tonight
You say I let you down
You'll never see me frown
She just acts like we never have met
I’m on the dark side of the road
And you say, “Oh my God
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown
I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
On top of the hill
Saying, “Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I just want to thank You, Lord
You didn’t show no visible scars
“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”
And, mama, you've been refused
Heading out for the East Coast
Goes rolling by
I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives
But I used a little too much force
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal’s death
I want to thank You, Lord
My bewildering brain, toils in vain
When we get up to it
And relive my dreams
Far down the street we stray
They keep it all hid
Joey, Joey
He bought me with a price
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Shake me up that old peach tree
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
			Señor, señor, do you know where we’re headin’?
It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist
In a basement down the stairs
And while ev’rybody knelt to pray
Down to your deathbed
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
The man in the trench coat
I been livin’ on the edge
Do you take me for such a fool
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time										 
I could be you
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
I can hear that whistle blowin’
It’s not aimed at anyone, it’s just escapin’ on the run
How badly they were shocked
The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
It’s pounding on your brain
			Your breath is sweet
They never did like Mama’s homemade dress
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
But fire next time
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Before it’s washed to the sea?
And how to throw the blade
Analyze you, categorize you
If we want to compete abroad 
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
And every one of them words rang true
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Then let him have my seat
Like your mama and yourself
Won’t fall upon them naturally
Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me
Inside of a leather cup
Did they hear when He told Peter, “Peter, put up your sword”?
It was a childish thing to do
Gonna leave a greasy trail
I long to see you in the morning light
And they put you on the day shift
They’d probably put my head in a guillotine
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
Who knows, baby
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes
Fear to bring children
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand										 
Broken bodies, broken bones
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
And I’m tired of this bag of tricks
That he not busy being born is busy dying
They’re an illusion to me now
But I know that he don’t talk
Ain’t that the way it oughta be?
I'll sell ‘em to their enemies
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Nothin' done and nothin' said										 
You can’t win with a losing hand
To get him to feel more assured
People think they know, but they're all wrong
But soon my words
But I could not get across
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
The city fathers they’re trying to endorse
Deny, defy or crucify you
As he bummed a cigarette
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Don’t follow leaders
Ev’rything is always right
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
If not for you										 
And I see through your brain
By His hand I’ve been delivered
			There's an evenin' haze settlin' over the town
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
They walk among the stately trees
It’s not my problem
“Your presence is obnoxious to me”
Discussed lepers and crooks
How all my fathers, they’ve gone down
I know a place where there’s still somethin’ going on
And Madonna, she still has not showed
But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
That I took up arms against you
Way out in the wilderness
I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
But all his sexless patients
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
Maggie comes fleet foot
At the head of the chamber of commerce
I’ve got nothin’ but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me
Don’t block up the hall
We walked together hand in hand.
Is a man who swears he’s not to blame
You have explained every mystery
Only one thing I did wrong
Didn’t I rise above it all for you
The branches cast their shadows over stone
The old one is long gone
			The seasons they are turnin’ and my sad heart is yearnin’
And the clouds are weeping
Why did they have to come and blow you away?
Can’t buy a thrill
And the mailbox is locked
It only brings me sorrow
Of two mules, trains and rain
In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light
One more cup of coffee ’fore I go
I was hungry and it was your world
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
Brains in the pot, they’re beginning to boil
Gonna change my way of thinking
Are beyond your command
Well, I’m scufflin’ and I’m shufflin’ and I’m walkin’ on briars
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead
A thousand miles from home
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
An’ it ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
In the long black coat
I’m crashin’ my car, trunk first into the boards
I’m no pig without a wig
Things come alive or they fall flat
Come mothers and fathers
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Yes, ’n’ how many times must the cannonballs fly
So now I’m goin’ back again
I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist
And is buried in the mud
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
I had to leave there in a hurry
On the pages and the text
Saying, “Throw me somethin’, Mister, please”
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop
You might think he loves you for your money
Make myself a different set of rules
Living in the Land of Nod
Oh me, oh my
Twenty years of schoolin’
All right, I’ll set you straight, can’t you see I’m a union man?
Stripes on your back and on your hands
I’m gonna spare the defeated—I’m gonna speak to the crowd
			It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe
She let go of my hand
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Somebody said from the Bible he’d quote
There was dust on the man
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?										 
When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
They’ll stone ya when you’re at the breakfast table
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian and the Jew
Don’t the brakeman look good, mama
And watch the river flow
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle ’til the moon is blue
Your sister sees the future
Can’t stand the suspense anymore
And that which you’ve given me today
Wiggle ’til it bites, wiggle ’til it cuts
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
I hope you’re satisfied”
Waiting to find out what price
You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
But by faith in Him who called
Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
They would turn into a meaningless ring
Foundationed deep, somehow
I'm sweating blood
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
By the saving grace that’s over me										 
Slip away
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more
But to the stars above
You can hear them blow
You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days
To get caught without a ticket
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
All the rest of them rebel rivers
Slithering his way through the grass
His bedroom window
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long										  
You that never done nothin’
I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives										 
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
And I wonder
I’m stark naked, but I don’t care
The suffering is unending
I don’t have the strength
Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
That you talk behind my back
But it was oh so hard to tell
Everybody must get stoned										 
She knows where I’d like to be
But he was famous long ago
She knows there’s no success like failure
If it’s really that expensive kind
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
We never did too much talkin’ anyway
From the thirteenth century
And tears or not, it’s too much to ask										 
You know, I never seen him before
I’m givin’ ’em lots of room
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
You discover there was no one true
Comes to call at times you least expect
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Thinking about the government
For them that must obey authority
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
In harmony with the cosmic sea
Out in your face just for kicks
			Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve
It can’t be this way ev’rywhere
Don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
Instead of this old bank of sand
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
Like a complete unknown
			I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
Everything I've ever known to be right has proven wrong
Well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Papa gone mad, mamma, she’s feeling sad
When I left my home the sky split open wide
All around the cabin door
Can't take much more
I got a God-fearing woman
I’m a little too blind to see
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
A lover for your life an’ nothing more
			Clouds so swift
She can do the Georgia crawl
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied
But soon hit the harder stuff
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
The Siamese twins are comin’ to town
Nobody would dare
From the sounds inside my mind
And you say, “Who is that man?”
He wasn’t too small and he wasn’t too big
They’ve got him in a trance
With a fantastic collection of stamps
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
That I might be gone a long time
I’m glad I fought—I only wish we’d won
And I’m in the shade
Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
What can I do for You?										 
With all these promises you left for me
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
			Of war and peace the truth just twists
I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove
Look around you, it’s just bound to make you embarrassed
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
I’d sure like t’ know
And nobody has to think too much
I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
She was standing in the door
Wiggle ’til you wiggle right out of here
Silvio
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
And I won’t let go, and I can’t let go, won’t let go
All my loyal and much-loved companions
I seen a lot of women
I won’t throw it up in anybody’s face
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
It looked like there wasn’t nothin’ that he couldn’t pull
And the only sound that’s left
Made before the foundation of the world
You could have done better but I don’t mind
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
I am not askin’ you to say words like “yes” or “no”
Like balloons made out of lead
Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today 
The man in the moon went home and the river went dry										 
How was I to know you’d be the one
And if my love is real
			I was blinded by the devil
Were his only audience
You say you’re lookin’ for someone
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
I can’t hear you anymore
I loved you then and ever shall
We walked together hand in hand
I’m sick of love but I’m in the thick of it
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bull”
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite
I’m gone										 
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
She promised that she’d be right there with me
I can live on rice and beans
It was all very painless
But if you want me to
But I know what you want”
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
There’s a million reasons for you to be crying
Your grass it is turning black
If her hair was still red
And I stopped in for a beer
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it
It’s a restless hungry feeling
To know which way the wind blows
I'm in a cowboy band
I owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true
Well, I’ve been to London and I’ve been to gay Paree
I crossed that river just to be where you are
It has the opposite effect
To get up and take another shot
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?										 
I’ve been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Orders from the D.A.
If I was still the same
There's a crash on the levee
I just can’t do what I done before
The pangs of your sadness
Then you ache just like a woman
Did they know right then and there what the power was worth?
With a pain that stops and starts
Cried the attendant and the nurse
Some place so high above this wall
Seeing the real you at last										 
I’m having a hard time believin’ some people were ever alive
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more										 
You're always on my mind 
And ask me to
Oh, when the night is disappearing
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you										 
Will later be past
So I’m goin’ to unpack all my things
And your death’ll come soon
Broken words never meant to be spoken
It was there he made his bed
You know you got
And there was nothing more to tell
This wheel shall explode!
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
But all their daughters put me down
Wish I was back in the city
And I know no one can sing the blues
And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh
Your magnetic movements
All I would like you to do
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
Are the things you need the least
Using ideas as my maps
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties on the board
Window wide open, African trees
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down
			Well, I’m hangin’ on to a solid rock
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows 
And they, they look at me and frown
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
For tellin’ stories
Upon four-legged forest clouds
There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere
Person crying
They run a brick-and-tile company
That you wanna hold me
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
A summer breeze is blowing
Why don’t you just come out once
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you
In the spotlight so clear
To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Love that country pie
Wond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie										 
Starlight by the edge of the creek
Anyway it wouldn’t ring true
I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you
They’re one day older and a dollar short
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears
Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise”
That you could not fix
Railings froze
I left all my dreams and hopes
She spends her time peeking
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!
Well a childish dream is a deathless need
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around
If she’s passin’ back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
Someone to close his heart
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
You’re the reason I’m trav’lin’ on
Better jump down a manhole
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
As I turn my head back to the room
Just as long as you stay with me
I'm traveling by land 
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head
It was from her ship a-sailin’
Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face
No one on earth would ever know
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
Eatin' hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town
I’m right from mine
And all of your children start to resent you
Bette Davis style
They’ll stone you when you’re playing your guitar
And the sails are spread
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart
Come sit down on my knee
Oh! Good old-fashioned war!
Don’t let me change my heart
A world that just don’t exist
I got a letter on a lonesome day
And your nose on the ground
They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules
Broken buckles, broken laws
With a killer’s pride, security
Come senators, congressmen
Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you
Broken idols, broken heads
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
Goodnight, my love, may the Lord have mercy on us all										 
Her mouth was watery and wet
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
They’ll stone you when you’re riding in your car
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
Wiggle ’til it opens, wiggle ’til it shuts
Well, I’m leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
			They ask me how I feel
She turned around to look at me
Well, the fog’s so thick you can’t spy the land
As he hands you a bone
I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you
When I paint my masterpiece										  
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea
(About the time the doorknob broke)
When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’
My ears hear a symphony
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door										 
I don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Well, they’re doing the double shuffle, throwin’ sand on the floor
And then the kerosene
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch
I’m gettin’ up in the morning—I believe I’ll dust my broom
Yes, ’n’ how many ears must one man have
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
And you are on dry land
You’d be honest with me, if only you knew
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
And when bringing her name up
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
Another best friend, somehow										 
Working as a cook for a spell
All around you
And who’s been left behind
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
But that’s not where it’s at
Forgive what you do
Something's out of wack
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
She’s an artist, she don’t look back
The slow one now
And I wait for them to interrupt
When someone attacks your imagination
Remember me to one who lives there
I want you so bad
And then he kneels
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They approve of me and share my code
I take good care
			You took a part of me that I really miss
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Better stay away from those
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Your babies are crying louder now
The walls of pride are high and wide
The whole world is my throne
All of those awful things that I have heard
You could shoot like Belle Starr
Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
Wiggle like a big fat snake										 
“What’s good for you is good for me”
When he’s got the hogshead up on his toe
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime
And a thousand miles behind
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
You can’t rely no more to be standin’ around waitin'
You’re in with
’Cause tonight I’ll be staying here with you										 
They’re like babies sittin’ on a woman’s knee
I could offer you a warm embrace
Some things last longer than you think they will
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
Though its glow is waxed in black
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But it’s been so strong for so long
Well, You’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green
I’m a-goin’ back out ’fore the rain starts a-fallin’
Split up on a dark sad night
It’s either fortune or fame
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
Sometimes it’s just plain stupid
To tax-deductible charity organizations
Howard said there’s only one place I know
And old men turning young daughters into whores
You're the only love I've ever known
Tossed by the winds and the seas
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep
Until one day he just appeared
They don’t want me around
What looks good in the day, at night is another thing
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
The past was close behind
That only you could see?
I can smell the tail of the dragon
She never stumbles
I had ’em once though, I suppose, to go along
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
To get into any kind of wind
Wiggle ’til it whispers, wiggle ’til it hums
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
			Nobody feels any pain
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”										 
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
The windows are filled with frost
They'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
So much oppression
It always does when you’re with me
We’ll just have to see how it goes
I only saw what they let me see
You have given all there is to give
No, I do not feel that good
I’ll remember you
God knows everything
The curse it is cast
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
I give what I got until I got no more
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
She was born in spring, but I was born too late
And the riot squad they’re restless
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
God knows when
Noontime, and I’m still pushin’ myself along the road, the darkest part
To protect you an’ defend you
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots
How long are we gonna be ridin’?
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
When your death takes its toll
Everybody get ready to lift your glasses and sing
Just don’t know what to do
Like a rolling stone?										 
It’s only people’s games that you got to dodge
			Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re trying to be so good
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
King of the streets, child of clay
Yet I swear I see my reflection
You say ya got some
Except hatred
The place I love best is a sweet memory
All day long I hear him shout so loud
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand
This sky, too, is folding under you
That light I never knowed
And hide it in your case
They’re drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
All night long
Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
And picking up Angel who
My fingers are all in a knot
You do good all day 
You’ve no need to linger here
I’m going back to New York City
While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
An’ pretend that we never have touched
Why then don’t you show it
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling
Walking through the cities of the plague
Well my captain he’s decorated—he’s well schooled and he’s skilled
Without you it's so hard to live  
Got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood
Because the cops don’t need you
Somewhere in the distance
The air is thick and heavy all along the levy
Well, I don’t know how it happened
Between the windows of the sea
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain										 
But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him
To understand you know too soon
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore
So darlin’, I’m countin’ on you
Last night the wind was whisperin’ somethin’—I was trying to make out what it was
Say for me that I’m all right though things get kind of slow
The next time you see me comin’ you better run”
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
Tell nothing except who to idolize
I was layin’ in bed
Nothing more than something they invest in
The pump don’t work
You say you’re sorry
To the valley below										 
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
People talk of situations
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
Leave at your own chosen speed
And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’
He answered with his thumb
And it’s only that I’m askin’
And you want somebody you don’t have to speak to
For now’s the time for your tears										 
Down in the easy chair!										 
That a man can’t give his address out to bad company
He oversees his kingdom
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
When he built a fire on Main Street
Lies that life is black and white
The cat’s in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
As if a wedding vow
Just what you’ll say
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
You've wounded me with words
Upon the street where mothers weep
Ol’ Howard just pointed with his gun
A squall is settin’ in
You say you’re shakin’
I wish the night were here
Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
I ain’t lookin’ for you to feel like me
You went years without me
And my time it isn’t long
She studied the lines on my face
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
They all fall there so perfectly
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
There’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck
No man alive will come to you
To get through to the man in me
But me, I expected it to happen
Sorry that’s nothin’ you would need to know
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
The last radio is playing
I got to get to her somehow
Thanks for the loan”
Here comes the blind commissioner
She went with the man
Then you set back and watch
And then complains
You can rock this joint
Or else expecting rain
			In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
Overturn these tables
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
God knows it’s true
Showing ev’ryone his gun
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Sugar Baby, get on down the line
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
And you turn and run farther
Seems like I been down this way before
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Water's gonna overflow
You left me standing out in the cold
This is the blind horse that leads you around
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”
Throw my troubles out the door
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Don’t you and your one true love ever part”
Hear the cracking of the whips
Saying, “Master, tell me why a man must be born again”
Now the senator came down here
Jolene, Jolene
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
With great lawyers you have
She once was a true love of mine										 
And that even the nobles get properly handled
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
I should have left this town this morning
Now the preacher looked so baffled
Of ancient history
You lie and deceive
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Now you see this one-eyed midget
I believe in you even though we be apart
You may be workin’ in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
You can get wrecked in this dance."
No man, no woman knows 
T’ anything I might’ve tried
That Baby’s got new clothes
To know and feel too much within
You hide in your mansion
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
To a shadow
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
You used to be so amused
People bending broken rules
The cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
Manipulator of crowds, you’re a dream twister
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
I got no choice
But the second mother was with the seventh son
A real suicide case, but there was nothin’ I could do to stop it
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
I do not walk the floor bowed down an’ bent, but yet
It doesn’t matter in the end
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm movin' along
Yeah, today has been a sad ol’ lonesome day
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
You say my kisses are not like his
As to be under the strength of your skin
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
She gone with the man
Will never buy back your soul
But you break just like a little girl										 
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
Though you might hear laughin’, spinnin’, swingin’ madly across the sun
An’ to come each time you call
But it would not be new
Timber two-foot-six across
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
City’s just a jungle; more games to play
While them that defend what they cannot see
She might think that I’ve forgotten her, don’t tell her it isn’t so
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
May you have a strong foundation
God says, “Out on Highway 61”
I tried to give you everything
It’s bad out there
Before I get to the ledge
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
Bow down to her on Sunday
And you say, “Impossible”
’Cause I believe in you
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Who will promise never to part
If I was with ’er too long
I spied my true love comin’ my way
			Man gave names to all the animals
Got nothin' for you, I had nothin' before
When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered,
O'er the road we're bound to go
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
It all seems so well timed
I’m just sitting here beating on my trumpet
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
To those condemned to act accordingly
Saying I don’t know when I’ll be comin’ back again
“Is it easy to forget?”
Did I hear someone’s distant cry?
Give me some milk
His mama sure was proud of him!
But the mountains of the past
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
And the first one now will later be last
Just like putting scissors to a string
Is, baby, be friends with you
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
I don’t care
Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
			May God bless and keep you always
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake . . .										 
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way
Walkin' ever since the other night
With his pointed shoes and his bells
You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you
And forgot about a simple twist of fate
My attempts to please you were all in vain
you can’t? Of course you can.”
To the valley below
I see that stationmaster, too
But I would never do you wrong
Winter would have no spring
We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I am not pleadin’ or sayin’, “I can’t forget”
Noah’s great rainbow
Then you do wrong all night 
You give something up for everything you gain
I will only let you down
While some on principles baptized
You might as well keep going now
Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown
But don’t think twice, it’s all right										 
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you										 
The fortune-telling lady
Going down in the valley and sing my song
The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
Will it buy you forgiveness
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
If your mem’ry serves you well
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
When my working day’s through
			If not for you
Darlin’, I’m a-countin’ on you
Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee
’Cause tonight I’ll be staying here with you
She’s nobody’s child
That you have forgotten me? 
Might as well keep going now
And there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls
For so long I’ve been stalled
You will start out standing
I’d forever talk to you
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
I’m tellin’ myself I found true happiness
To know that some other man is holdin’ you tight
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
My complexion she said is much too white
You don't ever
Then she hung it on a wall
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Keep me set apart
An’ cov’rin’ the crossroads I’m standing at
To push fake morals, insult and stare
Why would I want to take your life?
No one can ever claim
I’s just about to do the same
If I can't have you,
You’d be honest with me if only you knew
I’m avoidin’ the Southside the best I can
I hope you treat me kind
The ladies down in Darktown, they’re doing the Darktown Strut
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
But what’s worse
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Why can't we love like we did before
There’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry
All the way from New Orleans
Leanin’ on the windowsill
As they rode him in custody down to the station
For playing the electric violin
Who prophesize with your pen
Water pourin’ into Vicksburg, don’t know what I’m goin' to do
Into the world
At dawn my lover comes to me
You’ve been fooled into thinking
In His love I am secure
Get dressed, get blessed
By His word I have been healed
Just so you know where He’s coming from
A question in your nerves is lit
But me, I’m still on the road
All nonbelievers and men stealers talkin’ in the name of religion
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bear”
When they all come down and did tricks for you
And he was told but these few words
Yes, and I’ll go last
I see, I see lovers in the meadow
And have it on Highway 61										 
I believe in you when white turn to black
And the one I love so close at hand
Now, it's king for king
If it bothers you so much”
’Stead of acting like we never have met
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
Holding a blossom on a stem
Tweedle-dee Dum, he’ll stab you where you stand
Am I here all alone?”
All I ever do is struggle and strive
When we meet again
I can tell you are torn
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls
I’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
He said, “All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth”
They’re trying to blow it up
			I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around
Try to avoid the scandals
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It’s the top of the end
I can’t even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Reality has always had too many heads
Makes you wanna stop and read a book
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
With the tombstone blues
Is brought down from the castles
Oh, though my friends forsake me
You think I'm past my prime
That sucks you into feelin’ like this
And I’m still in this all-night café
There are some kind of things you can never kill
Do you have any idea why or for who He died?
That keep us so tightly bound
How is it you come to be this way?”
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don’t show one
Flagging down the “Double E?”
You can make it too
An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
Or disgrace you or displace you
And they’ve all liked your looks
And furnish me with tape
May your hands always be busy
Comin’ down the road for a country mile or two
You ever seen a ghost? No
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Can strut their feathers well
The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
Thinkin' ‘bout that gal I left behind
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
And because I . . .
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there
But you know that we shall meet again
Another day
Oh, what’ll you do now, my darling young one?
Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
With my mind a million miles away
They all got out of here any way they could
Would treat a father so
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
			Come gather ’round people
“You look like the silent type”
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
I just can’t be happy, love
With another tale to tell
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
I just don’t know what I’m gonna do
I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick
But evidently she don’t
The motorcycle black madonna
To wear earphones
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
And on their promises of paradise
I have no one to meet
Ev’rybody watchin’ us go by
I know I will sustain
I don’t wanna be your boss
That you’re tired of yourself and all of your creations
And the ancient empty street’s too dead for dreaming
She already is an old maid
Blood and water flowing through the land
She ain’t hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin’ her deep
I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
What can I do for You?
They’re making a voyage to the sun
If I didn’t have t’ guess
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Well, it's sugar for sugar
Trouble always comes to pass
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The woman I'm lovin', she rules my heart
If dogs run free, then what must be
Every day you got to pray for guidance
I’m ready when you are, señor
You might be somebody’s landlord, you might even own banks
Juliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off
I'd forgotten about you
God knows there ain’t anybody
“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Love that country pie										 
Bent out of shape from society’s pliers
God knows there’s a river
I’ve been walking that lonesome valley
Up and down the block
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Kick your shoes off, do not fear
High water risin’, six inches ’bove my head
			There was a little boy and there was a little girl
You can almost think that you’re seein’ double
So don’t fear if you hear
I heard her say over my shoulder
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
			Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs
The hour that sorrow will come
An’ punched my cigarette”
That Johanna’s not here
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart
Throw my suitcase out there, too
Can’t keep track of it no more
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Race or chase you, track or trace you
Are they lost or are they found
And the whole world is on your case
I’d be sad and blue
You may be a construction worker working on a home
That I done it the way
The whole wide world which people say is round
Full of emptiness and wrath
’Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
Unless you’re happy too
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
And keep your eyes wide
It ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe
It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun
I went to tell everybody
After the ambulances go
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
God knows there’s a heaven
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Aladdin and his lamp
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
And a wanderer by trade
By His strength I do endure
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
If you’re a doctor, I need a shot of love										 
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
With a crashing but meaningless blow
Won’t even say what it is I’ve got
“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
For me He was rejected by a world that He created
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
My captain, he’s decorated—he’s well schooled and he’s skilled
Than a place for you to stand
I keep listenin’ for footsteps
I’m going down the river
I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic”
By worthless foam from the mouth
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within
But the joke was on me
Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
Got more lives than a cat
They would not let me be
Wants eleven dollar bills
Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Please don’t let on that you knew me when
How your head feels under somethin’ like that
T’ deal with the dyin’
Seen better times, but who has not?
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
They brag about your sugar 
I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
I had a job in the great north woods
Speaking to some French girl
I’m rollin’ slow—I’m doing all I know
Face full of black soot
“Can’t you see I’m drownin’ too?”
And one day the ax just fell
I’m just going
And now the heart is filled with gold
But even the president of the United States
I’m stepping out of the dark woods, I’m jumping on the monkey’s back
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in

Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
But it never does
With every breath you breathe
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf
Stand up straight and tall
Make promises by the hours
What does it matter 
There’s no books upon your shelf
This place ain’t doing me any good
Carrying a dead man's shield 
But oh, mother, things ain't going well
Storms are on the ocean, storms out on the mountain, too
High water everywhere										 
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
Junk is piling up, taking up space
Your sweet voice
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
And tapestry of rhyme
The sidewalk and the sign
Doing your own thing or just being cool
A place where there is no pain of birth
She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
Everybody get ready—lift your glasses and sing
With some fine young handsome man
An’ pretend that you never have met!”										 
She’s looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand
God knows the secrets of your heart
And as for compensation, there’s little he would ask
An’ now people just get uglier
One of the boss’ hangers-on
And the superhuman crew
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
There was music in the cafés at night
Saying, “The sun’s not yellow it’s chicken”
No one t’ defeat you
Swamp's gonna rise
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on
When you wake up in the mornin’, baby, look inside your mirror
I’m just gonna let you pass
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
For me t’ return t’ her chase
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Blues this morning falling down like hail
I followed the winding stream
When men will beg God to kill them and they won’t be able to die?
And a cannonball blew my eyes away”
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need 
I’d like to get you to change your mind
Pretending he just doesn’t see?
Doesn't mean a thing to me
Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?
I been hangin’ on threads
Suicide remarks are torn
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more										 
They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will
They say that you’ve been seen with some other man
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue										 
I can’t find my knees”
We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
And tells me of her dreams
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart
May your song always be sung
You thought they were all kiddin’ you
How many of his pals have been killed
Says, “You’re dancin’ with whom they tell you to
And He never give up ’til the battle’s lost or won
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
You have many contacts
That your heart was longing for
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
I know a place where there’s still somethin’ going on										 
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
Nothing to win and nothing to lose
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
The world has gone black before my eyes										 
I’m here to create the new imperial empire
I’d just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
That was really shook
Can’t see over to the other side
Sailin’ round the world in a dirty gondola
All that and more and then some
And when finally the bottom fell out
It don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere
I care so much for you—didn’t think that I could
Tomorrow’s the day
I know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing still
			Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it
As I walked out in the mystic garden
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
Just to know that you are near
And you say, “What does this mean?”
See like me or be like me
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
I can’t use it anymore
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles
That hype you and type you
In the beginning, in the beginning
I'm pale as a ghost
When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue
On back to the South
And place them at the feet of a harlot
It's a new path that we trod
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
Yeah the road’s washed out—weather not fit for man or beast
’Cause the vandals took the handles										 
Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking
And wrap it up in a sailor’s knot
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
While others say don’t hate nothing at all
Against you comin’ around
No midnight ramblers like they did before
There’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
It could even be like a myth
Precious angel, you believe me when I say
Forgetful heart
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
The bridge at midnight trembles
You're just gonna lose
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
Written by an Italian poet
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Her sin is her lifelessness
Nothing with you when you go
For the wise men and the fools
But I can’t get close t’ her at all
While paupers change possessions
Then come back and see you
Which goes from bad to worse?
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
And one day he came passing by
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
To hold me in your arms
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
The answer is blowin’ in the wind										 
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
But all I care about now
An’ me, I nearly got busted
The hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim
So no stranger does intrude
You try so hard
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
She knows too much to argue or to judge
I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more
And someday maybe
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
			They sat together in the park
It’s not always easy kicking someone out
Romantic facts of musketeers
Kick my legs to crash it off
I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
Get back, write braille
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there
Saddle me up my big white goose
When only you are near
Well, they’re going to the country, they’re gonna retire
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head
My mule is sick, my horse is blind
Where wisdom grows up in strife
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too
Through the world mysterious and vague
I wish to God that it were night
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
I shall be released										 
There’s no water in your well
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
“Why must you even try?”
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?										 
Broken cutters, broken saws
It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away
And there’s no use in tryin’
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
I always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day
There’s seven new people born										 
Nations are angry, cursed are some
When he’s standing in front of you
But mama, you’re just on my mind
He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense
Michelangelo indeed could’ve carved out your features
Things I never meant nor wished to say
Some speak of the future
Strike another match, go start anew
On the pillow where you lie
Has been twisted and fed
And you know it
I was going down for the last time
			A worried man with a worried mind
God knows there’s gonna be no more water
Moving with a simple twist of fate
I met a white man who walked a black dog
Because something is happening here
He didn’t see her anywhere
So I came in here
You know I love you and furthermore
The best is always yet to come
There’s seven people dead
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame
Please understand me, I got no place for you t’ go
All the gold and silver are bein' stolen away
If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .
There’s a woman by the river
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months
You see somebody naked
When I left my long-time darlin’
If you’re lookin’ to get silly
Now won’t you tell me true
Though I know that evenin’s empire has returned into sand
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
People sleeping in broken beds
The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him
Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes
In a pine box for all eternity
As you yourself can see
And she aches just like a woman
There’s nothing in here moving
Newspapermen eating candy
So if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair
Once more for a simple twist of fate
An’ it ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe
I gotta go
They say ev’ry man must fall
Pick up your money
When I was in Missouri
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
Groundhog runnin’ by the country stream
I became withdrawn
Where black is the color, where none is the number
If dogs run free
But I did it, though, because he lied
Give to me my country pie
If you don't like it you can leave me alone
Well, if I die
Purple blossoms soft as snow
But you’re gonna have to serve somebody										 
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
And ask him do you want to make a deal?
I just wouldn’t have a clue
Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide
Oh, it’s so hard to get on
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’
For her I feel so afraid
No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?
The air burns and I’m trying to think straight
Broken voices on broken phones
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
You are dearer to me than myself
From the crossroads of my doorstep
Shadows even the silver spoon
To Jerusalem”
They’re just gonna have to wait
You lose yourself, you reappear
Is the saving grace that’s over me
Guess it’s too late to say the things to you
He saw an animal that liked to snort
It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay
Yet ev’ry distance is not near
The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”
You know I won’t be next to you, you know I won’t be near
Yes, ’n’ how many times can a man turn his head
From darkness, dreams’re deserted
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
No doubt in my mind where you belong
Broken pipes, broken tools
Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
All the money you made
To Williams Point
You forget all about the golden rule
I find it so difficult to leave
You've numbed my will
Saying, “This land is condemned
We loved with all the love that life can give
And be discovered beneath a truck
Yet there’s no one to beat you
I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face
Well, that high tide's risin'
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
Feelin' like a stranger nobody sees
Even Jesus would never
When your train gets lost										 
Every nook and cranny has it's tears
A little confused, I remember well
