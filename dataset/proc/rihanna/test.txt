It feels like more than distance between us In this California king bed
Get a space where my heart was

And don't care (Don't care)

But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets Feel like a brand new person
You a broken down
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did)
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end Now that it's raining more than ever
Loving you is suicide Te amo, te amo, she say's to me

It can creep up inside you
No, I'm not stupid in love This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Oh what are you willing to do?
I like it, like it come on, come on, come on
Finally I can't take no more
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
We found love in a hopeless place On the first page of our story
Patron shots can I get a refill
We gone forever Yeah, yeah
(Come here) Come here rude boy, boy
My California king In this California king bed
Used to love you, used to love you [Verse 1: Rihanna]
I'm not acceptin another apology After 3 years, Ima let it go
And I know I could be more creative
Money, money on my mind
Other boys I could not see
Wind it up 1 time wind it back once more Run, run, run, run
Survivor, Survivor
It feels so good just to smile, feels just like
I'm so hard (Too hard)
And I finally realized
On the other side of the ocean
I'mma let you take me higher
I mean who am I to hold your past against you
This is the new America
And I hate how much I love you, boy
Tricks calling the house, non-stop its
I know that you think it's fake
I like it, like it 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Calm yourself, he says to me
Go on and make it right
When I look outside my window
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
I love the way you lie Shine bright like a diamond
You shouldnt've give it to me good like that
and so tempted to pull out your I.V
Turned into a real sticky situation
Work work work work work work!
I want you [...] (Eh yeahh)
Go on and take a bow Grab your clothes and get gone
I feel so empty and hollow And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
To come and grab you
The reason that the sky is blue
You can pick the time and the place
Soon as I go the text you goin' right is goin' say Ooh na na, what's my name
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
Oh, stupid in love, hmm Let me tell you something
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
Let me make you rise, rise
Don't it mean I love you Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
Come in to me It's raining, raining
It has an area the shade of gray
Makes me wanna cry 'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
I just don't understand it Gyal a you mi waan
And come up with poetic lines
Whether wrong of right
All that I used to hate
Hurt hurt hurt hurt hurting Yeah, ok
For you're heart on me
We found love in a hopeless place
Make it last all night Want you to make me feel
I don't wanna rush into it if its too soon
The spirit of a hustler
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
Tougher than a lion, ain't no need in tryin'
If you can baby boy, than we can go all night
If you can go downtown with a girl like me
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then
I wanna take you away
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
cant standing around crying no more
I betta let ya' know That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard) ah yeah, yeah, yeah,
We gone forever La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
You need to get done done done done at work come over
Five fingers, hit it like you want it
I don't know ow ow why
Til the walls are goin' up
Oh why Sometimes I catch you
Baby you got the keys
I remember when I used to make you laugh
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
And I'm ready for change
Wrist to wrist, toe to toe
Round and around, and around, and around we go
Bands make your girl go down
I'm a 12 to a 10
Love it when you talk that talk to me, yeah Talk that talk to me, yeah
Just to make sure that you're really sure
And when it's over, and it's gone
I cant even get the emotions to come out
Don't want it to clash,
Livin' the life, the life
Sacrificing things
For you cats to get paid today
Fading, fading, fa a a ade away, away, away, away
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
There's a crater
And throw me against the wall Baby you got me like ah, woo, ah
Please recognize I'm tryin babe!!!!
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
(Ella ella, eh eh eh eh,eh eh) You can run into my arms
But I know you wanna stay
Tried to push myself but it just holds me back The stronger I go I'm learning fast to fly away
In my love chart, Chorus
Where dem bloggers at, where dem bloggers at
So amazing, so amazing
That's all I want La la la la
Yeah you know word of mouth
Shine bright like a diamond Shine bright like a diamond
Only girl in the world
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays
Guess that's what made me dumb
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
I need you now ohhhhh [Hook: Future] I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
Even when I'm right
Take me home, I put desire in your arms tonight
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Yeah, yeah, yeah I've been thinking bout ya late night
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Say my name, say my name
Can't catch it
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
Before the tables turn turn turn turn turn turn! Beg you something please
'Cause, baby, you're my disease
Call me Cruella, Medusa, that's something I'm used to
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
Baby, I'm a say your aura is incredible
When I was your girl
Cause I would never make it without it, and there ain't no doubt about it
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
But you gotta watch your hands
I feel like a monster Throw on your break lights
That's how we ball out You the one that I dream about all day
I need to get out of sight, fore I end up behind bars What started out as a simple altercation
I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
Palm to palm, we were always just that close
You turned around and gave me one last touch
They tellin' me X2
Knowing it all this time
This feels like so unreal I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
Ooh, ooh Hey boy I really wanna see if you can go
You know he ain't right
(Please)
Take em off,
Never got the whole in love thing
I wish that I could go to sleep. Loving you is suicide
Lets explore your talent Hey boy I wanna see
I can take a thousand miles in my stride, hey, yeah Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go
Man Down! Oh mama mama mama
And she flies it better You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Don't worry baby,
Only thing we have on is the radio-oh
Because we both know
We're ten thousand miles apart
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
Like a thief in the night
You a beast, oh
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
And I just wanna scream What now? I just can't figure it out
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
It can't end like this
I'll be all you need and more Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Let's push on 'til the break of dawn
But I know you need to get done done done done if you
'Cause I know you wanna see me No heels,
Bet you wanna put your name on it
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)
You can feel my heart
Feeling jaded huh?
'Cause I can hear you two times
Said I despise that I adore you And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
And nothing why nobody can do
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
A lie I didn't have to tell
I'm standing by your bed
Oh let the Jameson sink in
I'm Westside anyway
You are the one so I make sure I behave
I can be a lone wolf fishing Gotta get up out of here
"How could you let us down?"
I'm in love with you
Grab up your drugs, that make me happy
Baby we can get it on, yeah
Thought you would die for me
Bitch better have my money!
Just love me
Flat line on the EKG Flat line on the EKG Chest to chest
Where you from, who you know
Maybe you just need to send for me Send for me
Used to love you, used to love you [Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ooh-we, oh-yeah (hmm na na na)
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weak
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
Everybody putcha glasses up and I drink to that (yeah yeah yeah)
We found love in a hopeless place Yellow diamonds in the light
And once we gone (Gone)
Sometimes you get away
DJ, let it play
Fell in love, I fell in love
My love is your love, your love is my love Baby, I love you, I need you here
I won't play around
Hmm that's what my friends are calling me when
What you saying now, give it to me baby
I Don't fuck around
You had your GUESS jeans on looking sexy, oh huh girl
Come and put your name on it
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)
