Maybe we make a deal
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home
You could tell by the way she walks in the room She said it's her first time
Don't text, don't text, take a deep breath, take a deep breath
You smile I smile (oh)
Ooh, ooh
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
I'm always gonna do what they say
Through the clouds
Why you working so shy? Holdin' back, holdin' back
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight, Esco Don't question it
I told you I'mma make it happen, I commit it
And its starting today 'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
Don't rush, no pressure Put my key in the ignition
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
So why do I get nervous every time you, walk by?
It's green where you water it
I'm never gonna let you go
But no more
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
All I need is love
At school on the playground
Some people don't have a home But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
And wandered off to Chinatown
Are there any rules baby
And I wanna pick up my phone
'Cause everythings gonna be alright, I
I need to look in your eyes
How am I supposed to take that?
Like baby, baby, baby, no
There's nothing like you and me, together You got a fast car
So tell me why am I in tears, whoa
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight Your love is like a roller-coaster
You had me from the start, won't let this end
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
But baby I just want you to see There's nothing like us
I'm coming for you I'm coming for you
You are my love, you are my heart
Any chance that you could take my call?
But I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again
Lose what we are If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Tell me that couldn't see an open door
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I wanna give it all, give it all to you I wanna dream what you dream
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you (Alright)
(Believe, believe) where would I be, if you didn't believe Happy birthday You ain't gotta question it
And I don't feel like I deserve it
Nothin around me matters
God, forgive me
The one that I've argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bother with,
Oh my God! She hit me up all day, give no response
I can make you believe (yeah)
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
If I would have known it could have been you
Bring the doubters on
You tell me this is for the best
I'll buy you anything
It's funny how you use that time to have me replaced
Upside down
Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock
And I just can't believe we ain't together
Don't want for us to end
Girl nobody from the past is
Say that you love me
With me you're winning girl
Yeah Sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
That I'm all alone, all alone
Without you girl I ain't the man
Try to figure out which way to go
I don't wanna go down that road no more
Like a fantasy in front of me
Without your love
If I was your man, I'd never leave you girl
(We gon' do our dance)
I just want to see you smile
So DJ bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back 'Cause all around the world people want to be loved
Still I gotta have it
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
Can't sit in my room alone
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
I know it's hard baby believe, me That we can go nowhere but up
It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us
I love you
The truth don't make us relevant (the truth don't make us relevant)
Said you're running out of time
I'm the only one (Another one)
You were mine
Until I reach the point of no return And there's just no turnin' back
Open your mind, don't knock it till you try it, darling
(Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you) You're my favorite girl
You're the only girl that I see (only girl I see)
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
When your not with me
'Cause we both so distant now
Seen nothing yet
From the bottom to the top to (?)
Everything, anything that I could dream
Got so much more to live for
Between me and love,
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
There'll be one less lonely girl Saw so many pretty faces
'Cause I'm doing it with you baby
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
I did it to myself
(You're beautiful, beautiful, you should know it)
Let you know that you're always lovely
And I was so lost, until you found me
Let's make every second work it
No matter what, we party tonight
And never go away?
She made my heart pound
Only to lose yourself
I need you to set me free
Right next to you.
I'm gonna li-li-live my life
She's got everything I need and I'm a tell her one time
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
Your world
'Cept for the clock on the wall
Guess the end is finally near
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all [Chorus]
Im like damn you fly,
One less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
Could it be I don't know what's good for me? I'm notorious for thinking you're
Whoa whoa ah
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever
Like I want the best for us
I know things will get better
I can't live without my baby
Oh girl, cause you're all mine Oh
you just need to listen, i teach you how to fix it
Can we both say the words and forget this? Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Teach me right from wrong
But no not today, won't leave 'til I find what I'm looking for
I'll be standing right next to you
Voice goin crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
I'll give my life up for you,
Gotta be laying in that
Managed to save just a little bit of money
I'm sorry, yeah
Stand by my side, side, side
'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
That should be me Holding your hand
Tell me what I wanna hear
Roll my eyes
You got the pieces
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You know the truth, babe
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
Is it too late now to say sorry?
and it's probably why i'm scared to put the time in
Hope you feel the same First, I'll acknowledge
Imma hold it down for you, you
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Take a bow, you on the hottest ticket now
But that's all you can do
Let your heart heal
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
You catch my eye
Been you [Chorus]
Close to you
Feels like a blizzard in April
It's gonna end right but,
What do you mean? You're overprotective when I'm leaving
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Why are we far apart
Spend a week with your boy I'll be calling you my girlfriend
I'll be there when you're insecure,
Don't want us lose what we are
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?
Got me twisted (Oh yeah yeah) still I gotta have it
Well, everything I had to give
I know they said, "Believe in love," is a dream that can't be real
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators
Look at all the promises that I've kept I put my heart into your hands
Nothin else really matters
'Cause whenever
I'ma show you more than I ever could say Mark my words, that's all that I have
So you have to understand that these like
This is my moment tonight
Gonna give everything I have
'Til you're back again, yeah, yeah You think I'm biased
Ever had a guitar missing five strings?
But I was blind and now I know
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go) I gotta be the best, and yes
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all (at all) [Chorus]
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
Oh, what do you mean? (give it back, back, back)
So I, I just get my recognition from Him
but never ever have my bitches sitting court side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go BRIDGE So give me a chance, 'cause you're all I need girl
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
And I say C-C-C-anada, uhuh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So baby baby please don't stop girl (Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright) Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody
Oh Whoa
You're supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono

You know I'ma do you right (I'ma do you right)
Don't want us to lose what we are (yeah)
I tell you what I got in mind

And I just can't believe we aren't together
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no Focused, I'm focused
Holdin' your hand
Tell me what you're really here for (here for)
Someone to share my ring
And I fall in love with you all over again Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Now if you're tryin' to break my heart
I think I finally got it down
Forever peace
Don't you worry babe,
Between heaven and disaster
Is if you weren't here, whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Emotions ain't the same if it ain't about you, I don't get it
I can handle him
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart. I don't need a whole lot but coming from you I admit I
And just shake me, 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I still believe in love
I party hard like carnival let's burn this motha' down
Listen to these words right here Love me like you do, love me like it's new
(Madly in love) Babe, you are the reason to breathe
Oh girl, I just need to hold you tight
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
We don't got no label
She woke me up daily
It's getting harder to shield
I won't ever hesitate to give you more Cause baby (hey)
It's too much, feel like I'm drowning without your love
And every time I see you make that face
oh whoa, whoa, trust issues,
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer
And never say never (ne-never say never)
Then I understand
I know that I won't be the first one given you all this attention, baby listen I just need somebody to love
From left to right
To love again You ain't gotta make your mind up
There's not a thing I won't do.
What do you mean? (you're so confusing baby)
Don't want us lose what we are (we can't lose, nah, nah)
We do,
J-B, Luda!
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
I know you need a little while to believe again
The only thing I want in life
I'm all in
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
Hand and foot
What about a vision?
Us, trust...
I know we'll make it through One day when the sky is falling
But you can't fly unless you let yourself
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Ain't nothing more attractive than a mission Hopefully you'll give me a chance
My one life for sure
Its everywhere that I go
Uh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
'Cause honestly the truth is
You can fly away with me
(Back down to earth, back down to earth) I never thought that it'd be easy
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
You hit it right on the head
Oh yeah [X4] Louis Vuittons, on your feet
Honestly (honestly)
It hurts but it's necessary (yeah)

Love me like you do but let me go first
If you want the best for us

And to all the heart aching
When you love me like you do ooh, like you do

(Girl, I want ya) I want you
Everyone is itching from beauty
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company

Just to take 'em back tell me that
You know you're trying to be the best you can be

Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you (My prized possession)
And there's nothing my heart can do,
Ill always be there for you
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Want so badly for it to be reality
And say it to her, yeah Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
Oh, I really wanna know What do you mean?
Hesitate
Then baby teach me to behave
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think she might of lied (Oh yeah yeah)
This is more than a season
His body's too young to look like his

Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Just somebody to love, somebody to love,
Pray for the broken-hearted
My mama went off and left him
But I'm crazy over you
You ain't gotta question it (oh)
when you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
With the strength of our love
Don't you worry
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you) Shawty right there
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying Baby, baby, baby, oh
I'll be there when you're insecure
Tell me you love me Love me, love me
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
Oh company Can be, can be, be each other's company
If you need me
You smile I smile (whoa)
That we're broken [Pre-Chorus]
God sent an angel to help you out
Lifesaver oh (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver)
That should be me giving you flowers
That we were supposed to go
How many torn photographs are you taping back
It's really coming down tonight That's this..
That's not who you are
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Baby please don't go girl
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
Open heart
Tell me what you wanna drink
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
So baby know for sure
Our trust has been broken
Now I need you, not a moment later
I promise my dear I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya Love me, love me
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
Cause it's my command

Yeah yeah yeah She's my latin girl
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
But you tell me to go
(Before I saw you you)
Since you been away oh baby
From here my dear (yeah whoa)
But if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up) And never say never (ne-never say never, never say it)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
And he's older than me
Many have called but the chosen is you
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while What's gonna make you fall in love
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, I
You stay out drinking late at the bar
But you're only taking and not giving anymore
(Adore ya)
Step to the beat of my heart.
Treat you no other way than you deserve
All I need is you by my side
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
We both know it's a cruel world
'Cause this is my destiny I will never say never (I will fight)
(get away) one I let get away (get away) one I let get away (get away from me) [Verse]
I just can't sleep tonight
Help me to stay strong So take my hand and walk with me

Justin Bieber, you know I'ma hit 'em with the ether
In the meantime, girls be around me
So get your hands up in the air

A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
Where's the passion, oh?
And all that's left to do now is get at the mirror
Dont you worry
Through the storm and through the clouds
Oh, oh, no

And when I wanna talk you say to me
Over the mountains, across the sky,
She gon' work some more, work some more
This pain in my heart That should be me

First you're up, then you're down and in between
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up
When your heart's under attack
Soldiers are dying
You're the light that feeds the sun
(Be more straightforward)
Just be each other's company
Free to fall (she's free to fall)
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do),
"Were just friends," what are you saying
To give you more 'Cause baby
But hey now, you know girl,
Oh yeah

'Cause hate may win some battles but love wins in the end
Give me a time and place,I'll rendezvous it,i'll fly you to it,
Despacito
Waiting for your head lights
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
I'm the one you wake up thinking about
My first love, broke my heart for the first time And I was like baby, baby, baby oh
There's nothing like you and me, together There's nothing like us
Tus lugares favoritos
Now what am I supposed to do? Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
'Cause I really wanna be alone
But I can't speak, I can't breathe
I've driven almost every car

None of 'em shine brighter than you
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
Could this be happening to me, yeah?
Catching feelings girl Catching feelings
To touch the sky, yeah if you didn't believe

Oh company It ain't about the complications
On our way back down to earth
But you can be yourself for me, I'll take you as you are
Your lips on my lips, that's a merry merry Christmas It's the most beautiful time of the year
What do you mean? You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Now we don't wanna fall but,
Baby you won't ever want for nothing

Praying for a miracle

History sweater, serendipity when you with me
You're that telly cake with a Cali' shake
Where do I start?
niggas hating, i just wish that they would say it when they see 'em [Justin Bieber]
Said "there's another," and looked right in my eyes
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But something would be nothing
I close my eyes and pray
Only been missing my lover
Know they won't be happy 'til our love is over
Word on the street Santa's comin' tonight
Oh, how you do me
oh-oh-oh-ohh I keep thinking in my head that one day we'll separate
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us

You're way more than worth it
Mmmm I'd wait on you forever and a day
Justin Bieber
That'd be mine forever. And baby, everything that I have is yours

And my fight is your fight
To my significant other
Right next to you. We're made for one another
About a girl and a boy
If she holla (if, if, if, she hollas) let her go She's indecisive
I can't go on,
Don't want to be left with the questions, why
Lose what we are (yeah) She texts me "How's you love life?"
'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love
No-no no no

Faithful no matter the distance
Another day

Shawty is an eenie meenie miney mo Cant make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Kissing on your neck while you Love me like you do, love me like you do

To show you, and hold you
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you
Don't do it, baby
Cause i don't wanna see you cry
Oh, you are
Lose what we are It's like you're always looking for a problem

Oh company Ooh no, ooh no, ooh
We're gonna make it girl I promise
I'm the one, yeah (that's right), I'm the one, yeah

You already know the answer (you already know the answer)
With you with you oh without you Girl you don't know how I feel
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl
Yeah I wish we had another time,
We would be on the phone all day
You gotta make a decision
That's what it's that's what's happening with me
I'll never let you go, (Ooh no, oh no, ooh)
I just need somebody to love. With you,
But I will take my chances [Chorus]
No more holdin back this time Now that I'm back around ya
They only get as close as you allow them to
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
You give me purpose in every way Oh, you are my everything
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
cause i don't trust these women, i don't, i don't trust these women,
We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.
You should go and love yourself For all the times you made me feel small
Can't you see me
Baby take it slow so we can last long Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
I am the one for you (I'm the one) yeah I'm the one As long as you love me
You been gone far away, I just need to hold you babe
Ain't no way
Yeah, all around the world, they're no different than us
Oh oh oh oh One day when the sky is falling,
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Stress out over me [Verse 2]
That only heaven can make.
And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
Be each others company Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Well giving up is immature
I know that you ain't got no plans to leave
smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
Promise you won't keep me waiting
I had a notion, deep as the ocean
Be alright, I
Oh, don't miss out on us
My heart is
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Makin' you laugh
One less lonely girl
One time My friends say I'm a fool
All around the world, they're no different than us
I'm still stuck in the moment with you,
But it's strong enough to hold us up
But you sometimes say no
And we don't wanna fall but,
And never say never Never say never I will never say never (never say never)
In love with you, am I in love with you?
When you don't want me to move
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
My lifesaver
You would make my life complete.
There was nobody that compared to my baby
I know we won't find a love that's so true There's nothing like us
I'll be standing right next to you,
And all the clubs you get in using my name
Oh, you are my everything I don't know if this is wrong
That you're the one
(Back down to earth, back down to earth) Mommy you were always somewhere
leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
I need you to set me free , Yeah I need you
Is this meant to be?
kick game, run game, run it real good
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,
I'm the only one
So I'm working on a better me Life is worth living
looking for some things and i think that i can find them in you, in you
All I wanna do is you, oh
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
be pink, 'pending on how you mix that ish, money that
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up
No...
Oh Never say never (never never never) You see I never thought that I could walk through fire (aye)
Never should've let you go
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
'Cause we're strong enough to endure, woah If I believe in love
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Yeah, 'cause all around the world, they're no different than us
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
I thought you'd always be mine, mine When I was 13, I had my first love
Last time we argued eight straight days
Let's start over again So it's up to you and it's up to me
We'll take you to the sky past the moon
Cause everythings gonna be alright, I
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
First you wanna go to the left, then you want to turn right
I will catch you if you fall If you spread your wings
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
'Cause you are my dream. And baby, everything that I have is yours,
Louis V. shoes, look at me do it
I can bring you, give you, the finer things yeah! But what I really want, I can't find 'cause,
'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me
The coolest girl I know
My lifesaver (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) Whoa Never understood you when you'd say, whoa
Through the galaxy
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take I know
There's so much more to live for
And I'm a be your one guy
Do you believe enough to die for it? Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
All I want is love and romance
(I'm drowning baby, I'm drowning)
I got you baby See we both,
Sayin nothin gets you nowhere fast
Baby take a chance or you'll never ever know
Oh no, don't have a care in the world
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
Real deep pockets like a doctors clothes
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
You're pulling me
I'm reaching out for you
You're all that matters to me Across the ocean, across the sea
Life is worth living again Just a fraction of your love
Swag swag swag, on you
Pushed you far away Learned it don't pay to lie
You're the only reason why
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
What do you mean? I want to know, oh
let's call up on drinkin' let's all get wasted,
A thousand days without your love, oh your love Oh, baby you can do no wrong
They say that hate has been sent
Why's it feel like
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
I'm the only one Lookin' for the one? Well, bitch, you're looking at the one
Oh that ain't doin' too much You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Could never be all I could be
You got your hazard lights on now
Oh
My baby, my baby, oh Promise I'll play no games
When your heart beats, I can hear it oh no
When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Just take my hand [Bridge]
Remember when you took my hand
Don't rush, no pressure You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Show of, when you come closer
Camera's point and shoot,
Maybe we'll make something
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And we will never, ever , ever be apart Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em
'Cause I know you can't love me here I wish we had another time,
Our bodies touching while you Love me like you do, love me like you do
We gotta make a decision
Once again, the dynamic duo's back at it
I promise girl I swear, I just need somebody to love. I need somebody, I-I need somebody,
We're the generation
A couple of things I can't spell without you
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
I skip a beat when I see her in the street
Skating on thin ice
And I can't stand to see another man making you smile, your smile, your
You make me complete
That you keep that smile. Yeah, you are my dream,
And I can't stand and see another man making you smile, your smile, your
No, I don't wanna leave you, I'm no good alone
You had that effect on me
Yeah yeah, ain't worried about nobody else
I want a ticket to anywhere
Hurts but it's necessary (yeah)
What should I do, babe?
And I was like uhuh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, trippin on you, trippin on you)
Fills the air
I need somebody I-I need somebody) Everyday I bring the sun around,
Oh, don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it All in it, all in it
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (hopscotch)
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine! I know I won't be the first one,
love me, love me, love me
Bonnie and Clyde,
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around,
We're not the only ones doing it like that, yeah, like that
Half empty
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Gone, gone, gone I'm gone gone You've got that smile,
How many times you don't want me to leave?
Madly in love
'Cause I don't need you to stress
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
In the fights,
(Madly in love) [Verse 1]
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you,
With you with you oh without you [Verse 2]
If you want the best for us I got the best for us
Cause whenever
I come runnin'
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
Despacito What do you mean?
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Because someone else is telling me that it's wrong
Let me, let me, let me, be all your desire
My sunrise on the darkest day
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
To pull up in the driveway
Cause this life's too long
The only thing that I got right now One day when the sky is falling,
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
This time I'll do you right I'm going through all the motions
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above
Oh yeah Who's got the heart?
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
Whoa, no, no, whoa whoa, ooh, whoa
I gotcha lil' bro
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, but I can't stop starin' at your face
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah It don't make sense, no
And there's a viable term in me
Got me out here in the water, and I I'm overboard (overboard)
Don't say nothing, girl, I'm all yours
Cause when I stare in your eyes
And I'm willing and I'm able
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em They ain't never had my back like you got it
Stress out over me [Verse 1]
Pick it up, pick it up
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken [Pre-Chorus]
This is so wrong,
Been around a million stars
Sometimes it ain't breezy
But you can't fly unless you let your
And shoulders have you cried on before?
I'ma make you believe girl
Did we really come this far
I said who's this girl, she's lookin dragon fly Hey miss beautiful
Said it won't hurt my side
Don't be scared, girl I'm here
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
If I was your boyfriend Eenie meenie miney mo
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
Cause you're not here with me
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Don't stop baby no (no)
Any day can work it if you're working with people saying
Like the echo from your voice set the world shook
(Ne-never say never)
The only thing that would hurt me,
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
Let me ask you girl where your mind is
With you with you oh without you [Chorus]
Gonna get any
What do you mean? (give it back, back, back)
I'll still
Then you walked by
Hold up, aight?
Promise I will stay right here
Forget about the obligations
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
Baby I want you to know
What do you mean?
It's crazy crazy crazy (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver)
And I had a feeling that I belonged
We'll move out of the shelter
I don't want to sleep unless you at home It don't make sense, no
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?
I don't need a whole lot but coming from you I admit I
To touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Girl, without you I'm lost
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure Thought that you were in it for the paper
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
Oh I, Oh I
(So baby no for sure)
Had to find out the hard way
Then we gotta learn to trust right now Growing pains come along with these changes
Kiss me, kiss me
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
I'm not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind, wind
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, never let you go Na na na, na na na, na na na
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it They ain't never had your back like how I got it
To the galaxies
Baby don't shy, oh
Oh my, dirty bass oh you got that small, I can break that off
You and I would stand to be love's reply Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
Don't wanna lose, no
Uh, yeah Where are you now
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
That would break my heart to pieces
Oh, where are you now So take my hand and walk with me,
You're my everything
One and only
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you diamond ring And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
I don't ever wanna fight yeah, you already know
same nigga that you knew way back when
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
Connect with your soul
Home this Christmas I'm praying that you make it home tonight
And show 'em how we feel You're who I'm thinking of
The one I can't live without, that's you, that's you You're my special
Do you believe enough to die for it?, to die for it? Who's got the heart? who's got it?
Waiting for your headlights
Better make up your mind
I can handle him Now he's bigger than me
Oh I don't know your name
The only problem was with you and not them
You're not hard to reach
Oh, been around the world, ain't the same without you
Catch a bad chick by her toe
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place
oh yeah
Can the DJ please reverse it?
Give it all you got
There'd be the one less lonely girl Saw so many pretty faces (before I saw you you)
(You are here, you are here)
Forever
Like David and Goliath,
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out What's gonna make you fall in love
When there's no road, to get to your heart
There's gonna be on less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
I'm a me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
(Don't want you to go oh no so) Let the music blast
Madly in love, yeah
With you, under the mistletoe Aye love, the Wisemen follow the star, the way I follow my heart
(Reality, reality)
Let you know that you're always lovely.
I close my eyes and pray Well let me tell you a story
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
I don't want to go back
Girl I never believed in,
My lifesaver (Lifesaver, oh lifesaver) Yeah Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Be alright You know that I care for you
Body rock, Oh, oh, oh I never thought that it'd be easy
Stay fitted like Diddy hair back tryna rock the boat
I could be your Buzz Lightyear fly across the globe
And I fall in love with you
There ain't no "I" in team
Hope you did the same I know that I caused a problem
As long as you love me [Chorus]
Like baby, baby, baby no
When you love me like you do?
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven
I'm standing on the borderline, oh Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
It goes her, blank blank, and rock & roll
Baby, baby, baby oh
Would you come right here and do it, baby?
While you're driving here through the winter snow
They say we're too young for love, but I'm
That's what we ought to do
Is despite all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
We are both too foolish to stop Now you don't wanna let go,
You already know the answer
I ain't never going nowhere
'Cause everything we did,
Ey ey ey, oh
She's my latin girl Oh she tries to fight it but she knows she likes it
Trying to fight the urge to call
But the next day bothers you, I You're all that matters to me
And the bright lights
To fight with time and space 'cause, (and space)
Mark my words Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah oh
Let me get that (get your ass on the floor) I'm gonna live my life
Listen to your deepest feelings they don't ever lie
But you can't fly unless, unless you let yourself fall Mark my words, that's all that I have
You give me purpose
With you with you oh without you [Verse 3]
Oh oh oh
You'd choose me, right? Love me like you do, love me like you do
You knew one day I would be standing tall
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
I was just sittin' like a patient
i don't need to say wassup and my excuse is that i'm young
Say it's my fault
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Beauty, beauty and the beast
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
Love me like you do do do
You're all that matters to me Take the gas out the car it won't drive
And I need your love
I don't care,
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
To think that you're the one for me
That's what they used to say I'm just going to sleep alone at night
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's is our point of view (view)
Na na na, na na na, na na na ey
Hypnotized by the way she moves Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
And I know that I don't wanna lose your love oh baby, oh baby
No matter when, wherever I am
Why don't you take my hand
Holla, we're the party, we that
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
Girl I need your attention
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is You ain't gotta make your mind up
i'm on one, you know, i'm on one, yeah
For that long journey ahead
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
'Cause everythings gonna be alright
No one has a solid answer
'Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change It's all about the magic
(Nothing my heart can do),
We can keep it goin' up
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh (so much better)
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe

But I fold to your wish
Don't know what I would do
And never say never Here we go
She got a body like that
Any place is better

Now that I'm half grown
Common denominator
And just look at us now 'Cause everything starts from something
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any fuckin' body
'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Hey Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
And we're wondering how
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
This is so sad
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me 'Cause everything starts from something
And our love was in vain
Laughing 'bout nothing at all
Yeah
Think about it You ain't gotta make your mind up
So let loose the talk of love
I can't swim on my own
Show me what to be
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, [Verse 1]
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
(Back down to earth, back down to earth) We fell so far away from where we used to be
And never say never Me plus you, I'm a tell you one time
i could tell, i could tell, i could tell
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
Said it ain't ever over
And disappear right after the song
( get away) one I let get away (get away) one I let get away (get away from me from me)
With me, girl, is where you belong
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it If you got a twenty for all of your tries
As long as you love me
Oh, what do you mean?
We chase the game that would put
Candles all around us
I'ma hold it back inside But now that i'm back around ya
A minute with you is worth more than
How many tears you let hit the floor? How many bags you packed
Ooh I don't work hard when it's easy
cause you're the only one oh whoa, trust issues
You will never go cold or hungry.
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
(Like your living your life)
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
Like you do
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Wishin' I could just wash away
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Only wanna live it with you Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
Or am I in love with the feeling? (Oh) (Oh) You give to me
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
Felt like I was doing my part
From a thousand miles away
Stress out over me
Smoking on the beat, with my backpack on
I'll be waiting I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
Buns out, wiener, but I gotta keep my eye out for Selena
She know she got me dazin'
Oh, yeah, woa Just a fraction of your love fills the air
I need you here with me all night
¡Bailalo! Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Baby, okay, okay though Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie no
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
Catching feelings
You know I'm used to making your day But that is the past now, we didn't last now
Falling in and out of trust
Wanna argue all day, hangin' out all night (oh)
Beautiful girls wearing high heels
You had my child,
They try to crucify me
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it, all in it, all in it All in it, all in it See, growing up I
This time i'll do you right (I'ma do you right)
I need somebody, I-I need somebody somebody to love
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl) I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
Pretty baby, baby, I'm begging lady, lady
I'm going down, down, down, down
Make me smile baby Baby you won't ever work for nothing
To the galaxy
We'll be changing like the seasons
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?
Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known
Oh no no, oh no, but still I gotta have it My life is a movie and everyone's watching
(Ne-never say never, never say it)
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
I'ma do you right
Life is worth living again Relationship on a ski slope
Just to watch it go down the drain yeah? Sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
Down to earth, down to earth
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
And give Him recognition Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I won't let the night stand in my way yeah
To fight with time and space 'cause,
Girl move it like Pilates
Would you lie to me baby
And I only wanna live it with you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
But your faith in me was so clear
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
Hell yeah, dirty bass No matter where we be at VIP, or in the C lac'
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
women want to fuck like they're me and i'm them
cause you're the only one, cause i don't trust these women
Said you want this
Be right there (be right there)
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
So when I invite you
Through the storm and
Need to see your face
You smile
It's working 'cause you know that That should be me
Who'll show you grace?
All of the memories
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)
I smile Feelin' the remnants, gone in an instance
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get
You just be honest with me, I know we can make this work
And stronger than me
That I wouldn't mind
Oh girl, your body is so insane, making me call your name
Here's my soul to keep
All we need to start it is the speakers in my chit-chat
Running in the same place
Baby we can go nowhere but up, oh
You should go and love yourself
No, It don't make sense
From the bottom of my heart, please believe You're all that matters to me
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
(We can go oh oh, whoa whoa)
Avalanche comin' down slow
'Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
You know that it humbles me
Girl I never believed in
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
'Cause ain't no way,
Don't rush, no pressure Looking out the window
To be in your arms, holding my heart Ooh I, oh I, oh I, love you
A successful recovery
I ain't perfect, won't deny
If you believe in love
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
And the walls are closing in on us
I'm in love, I don't know what to do
You... You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? Ooh, ooh
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
(They don't matter at all)
So give me the night
I'm the only guy that you need (I'm the only guy that you need)
Ooh, ooh I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
Yeah Where are you now
You're all that matters to me Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They ain't never had a chance how we got it
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
Just look at me now 'Cause everything starts from something
Whoa oh, whoa oh,
And we'll cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
And all it offers
You and I in that wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape
Oh, oh
So you like that? All around the world people want to be loved
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Oh, oh, oh
Woah, ooh
To just being one half of the equation I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
(Alright, yeah, alright) Oh oh oh
(The one that makes me crazy) The one that makes me crazy
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
There might be something real between us two, who knew?
Beating you right now 'Cause I take you home to mama
Baby do it like you do In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
I know that we gon' be alright
Won't you pull up to me now, I'm forever young
I could almost hear a pin drop
Only God can judge me
Playing girls was my high
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
Tearing each other down
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you
Running a thousand miles to get to where you are
But I feel like that's gonna change You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
'Cause you're the girl of my dreams My prized possession
You've always been my girl (ah)
I thought you'd always be mine Oh for you, I would have done whatever
Honestly the truth is If I could just die in your arms
And I know the seasons may change,
Or really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya

Cause I need your, your love, yeah
Tragedy was our destiny,
Unconditional as it'll

Swaggie PRE HOOK I'd like to be everything you want
If she holla (if, if, if she holla) let her go
All the time Like a permanent stain
She can't decide
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow
I need somebody, I-I need somebody.
She was the one I let get away (get away) one I let get away(get away) one I let get away (get away from me)
It just tears me apart So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)
Waiting for your phone call to come soon

Hey hey hey Your lips, my biggest weakness
I know there's good times behind that pain
And your heart (is my heart) Your my one love
Keep you on my arm girl you'd never be alone
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
If you didn't know, this is love (Let the music blast)
Ghetto girl, you drive me cray
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Look at all of these tears I've wept
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
And I'm down with it
The one I can't live without, that's you, that's you You're my special little lady
They try to sour the thrill
Like you do, love me tight and don't let go
But I just keep on sayin' Baby, baby, baby oh
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
But you're scratching the surface
Oh company Let's set each other's lonely nights
Money can't find me somebody to love. Oh whoa, find me somebody to love ooh I need somebody to love, I-I don't need too much
It's all by you, when the music makes you move
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
You don't deserve it and don't give in
I'll be waiting for you
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
What do you mean? Love is in the air
Don't shed a tear, whenever you need me I'll be near
March and play for ya! For you I'd be, whoa
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
I was on vacation
Be alright Through the sorrow, and the fights
Your love is keeping me warm, warm, warm [Pre-Chorus]
I'm gone For all the times that you rain on my parade
You smile I smile
I can't picture you out of my life
As much as I love you yeah
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
Seen her scream and holler
I'm still stuck in the moment with you See like Adam and Eve,
The one that makes me crazy
coming live from the mothafucking north side
When the sky falls down
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
That if it's meant to be it will be, whoa oh no So crazy in this thing we call love
But I'm losin' you
Oh girl, your body is so insane, making me call your name, girl
I been working at the convenience store
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
Not feelin' no pain or fear
This time i'll do you right Missing your good intentions
Trying to compromise but I can't win
We're the fliest
I close my eyes and pray I lose my appetite,
You know I'ma do you right Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
It's all fun and games,
(And it's much to strong)
Blue like the sky, oh my Like a permanent stain
Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah
The way that you take my breath away
Rather give you the world or we can share mine!
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
In every way I will
I will never say never (I will fight)
Let's be honest with ourselves
I wait on you
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Baby do it like you do
(My favorite girl, my favorite girl) My favorite girl
With you, shawty with you
