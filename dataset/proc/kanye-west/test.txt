And this verse only add to the freshness
Woman to hold and keep the safest
So close so close but so far so far
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
Everything she was doin was cool but it aint Ralph though
Oh we gotta have JE sing at the wedding

We some true Chitown legends accept no imposters
Lord have mercy thou will not hurt me
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up
Doctors say Im the illest

Illuminati High society
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Like Hey didnt you play in No it couldnt be quit playin

She from a battered home she mad when she at home
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
Lucky I aint had Jay drop him from the team
Golly more of that bullshit ice rap
The pop community I mean these bitches come with union fee
High like I like mercury
From the streets to the league from a eighth to a ki
And shell do anything for the limelight
And she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
This is the moment grab your Kodak
ChiTown gogettin pimps we mobsters
This scene occurred
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
Maybe thatll work when you get to hit that ass again
When she walked up out the dressing room the store just froze
When you never fuck with the lights on
So you can say Im on my Brad Pitt
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
And bring a friend for my friend his name Kweli
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
We had problems but its all in the past
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Theyd rather see a nigga locked up why for stupid shit
Flow so ugly money so handsome

This the life that everybody ask for
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah

Arm Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
What I had to do had to run from you

That lean got us dozing we forget that we the chosen
And I swear to God I hope they post it
Stop your cryin baby
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus Ross grunt
I knew that I couldnt cop a coup with no coupons
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
My apologies are you into astrology
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
Ive been outta my mind a long time
The plan was to drink until the pain over
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Just remember that you talking to me though
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Before I had a house and Id do it again
Since the tight jeans they aint never liked you
Praises due to the most fly Prada
These niggas aint ready for action
Bitch bend over Im here for a reason
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
Why dont you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
Blow the back out til you backless
Whats in front Benzes What else Lexus
Lifestyles of the broke and famous
Niggas is loiterin just to feel important
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
If not for pleasure then at least for the principle realize
Ought to blow just like a chick givin oral yo
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
We saying the same thing like a synonym
I am a god
It keep me writing so exciting
Cause they dont want nobody thats colored out of the lines
In the restroom fuck it every room
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
That if you look at my life I guess hes talking back
How many ladies in the house
Well buy a lot of clothes when we dont really need em
From the place where the fathers gone the mothers is hardly home
And if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going
Late for the class in the hallway nigga
What that mean I aint callin nobody back
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
Fire up tweaking
When you aint always wrong
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers

Okay I dont remember where we first met
They favorite Cent song Questions
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Whats scary to me is

First class with the seat back I still see ya
I told you motherfuckers it was more than the music
Shout out to LEP Jay Boogie right
No matter who you go and get
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
Dropped The Dropout and blazed em
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
Top MCs you aint gotta remind me
The good life lets go on a living spree
Now you sittin courtside wifey on the other side
Merry Christmas
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
And your girlfriend she kinda raw
Put and together and a little bad weather
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade

Single black female addicted to retail and well
Louis Vuitton feathers now that some fly shit
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
Why A little rain never hurt no strippers
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
Told her I aint paying tonight Im only browsing
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter

Stunting out the middle of nowhere like Vegas

Eating good vegetarian with the brown rice

One day I play Kobe
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
See niggas come by talkin bout they make it rain
Kanye step away from the lime
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So I guess we should address it huh
And when she do she pouring out her heart
I see you bouncing it up and down and ooh I like it
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
R Kelly and the God of rap

Sometimes its so hard to say bye
Cause you do shit the broad way nigga
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
Rurunning my credit card til theres no more left

And I bottled it up
Im Socrates but my skin more chocolatey
I put holes in everything else
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
But I never hit a woman never in my life
Arguing with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
The same one I gave Keyshia Cole man
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
They say Damn Yeezy Yeezy you dont know us no more
Then I hope this take away from my sins
Theres only one girl on my agenda
I just left the strip club got some glitter on me
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
I know I got a bad reputation
Never know enough til its over love
Well thats cool baby girl do ya thang
And every time they flake like frosted
This is more than just my road to redemption
Yall cant match my hustle
Peekin through the keyhole the door locked by myself
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Well if you goin coupe Im goin four door
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo
Get back gimme room room room

Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Dont worry why my wrists got so freeze
Dont ask why shorty be over
Cause we too high up in the air
Its crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
If you run into me better have Allstate with yah
Cause you in my soul and system
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
Lost in this plastic life
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
How we out in Europe spending Euros
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
A country girl that love Hollywood
I imagine thats what Chris told Karrueche
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
So I pour the potion so we could both get high as we could go
And a lap dancell probly be a blessing right
Breasts is just like Dolly Parton
And we high as the way we cruising on
She said ‚Äúhey Ye‚Äù
When I pulled up to the light
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
They dont want to turn they speakers up they claim I aint deep enough
Later on I might charge for menage
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
My freak girl told me now she a Christian
We killing the game its not fair
