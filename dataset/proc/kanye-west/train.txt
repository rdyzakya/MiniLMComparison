At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong

After all these longass verses
Off in the mirror like hey me stay me
Cause we cant get along no resolution
Whered you come from on this lonely night
In the morning you gon draw a blank
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
In the bathroom at your mamas
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
She said no just sight seeing
This a song with Wayne so you know its gonna melt
I told her it was good its too bad it got ugly
But if you dont mind Ima keep you on call
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Thatll come by my bed late
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
A rub down

Why you keep bawlin though girl you aint been around niggas before
People saying Ye Ye take it easy
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
Her dress is just per uhh

How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
I know I know I know when I see it
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
You got something that I cant fight
And show me why you deserve to have it all
How you gon lie to the lawyer
So I guess Ill see you in my nightmares
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
When I would hold you
Listen yo
Im bout to fuck somethin up
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
Wonder why it so hard when it get going
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Feel like Deepak Chopra
I bet no one knew I got no one new
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
Shits about to get hard now

She pulled her blouse up said ‚ÄúIts free‚Äù I said WOWZERS
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
Your fly is open McFly

Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And you dont be sayin shit when they askin questions
My psychic told me shell have a ass like Serena

Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Theres a thousand yous theres only one of me
People drowning in debt
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline

Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin
Seven oclock thats primetime

Of our imagination MTV cribs

Feelin on a girls ass with a troubled past
Early morning cartoon shit black

She asked Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was
Nobody can tell me where Im headin

Now this Hennessy
These niggas asswater get the Drano
This is the making of a masterpiece
Goddamn we made something from nothing
He said ‚Äútake them glasses off and get in the pool‚Äù
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
One thing I gotta call out boy take a look at Fall Out Boy
This the number to dial
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
You got a new friend well I got homies
Makin Mo Money cause of The The The The Roc
Young Hov what we doin doin doin
Grew up on Mobb Deep speak that Jourdan Dunn language
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
They outside of the emergency room room
Two words Chitown South Side worldwide
These niggas read the pimp manual but I designed it
What if we fuck right now
Truest girls get half naked every spring
I studied the proportions
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And I dont usually smoke
About my vision

And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
RB singers and lesbians rappers and managers
Cause they know when you famous
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
When I fight and you fight we dont fight fair
Ice chain Carti lens and a knapsack
Shoutout to Jackie Chan I need to stunt right now
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
They aint seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Everever Mr West is in the building
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
Every time magazines try to taint my name
Her heels set the mood
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do

You blowin up thats good fantastic
The chokes and the screams

The head still good though the head still good though
Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
Hey you remember where we first met
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
You know you throw your diamonds when I rock with you
They steal your whole sound thats a soundbite
Lets go back back to the Gap
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
And came out of your body
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
You know the drinks let you say things you aint allowed to
When your man be around you dont speak to me
If I be with you baby Im confused

Outta the box reach for it through the threshold
With the top off lookin for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracee Rosss
But Im so bad
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell

She spent her whole check on some Christians
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
And held it til the right time
You would know how Mase felt
In a life or death situation
Walkin livin breathin god you know my past well
Photoshoot at my crib

Based off the way we was branded
This finna be another classic bitch

I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Why my pants sag off Cause Im rapping my ass off

We hanging out that window its about to be a Suge night
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout

The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing

Only problem is I see they all want a ring ring
He asked me about my Maybach think he had the same
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly

Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Well thats cool I fucked the waitress
She Instagram herself like BadBitchAlert

Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Snap the Nikons with the icons with Nikes on
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
And at the end of the night bae
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
And Im the best version of Mase next to Fab
Get it
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo
I know I know I look better in real life
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
You realize we at the DoubleTree not the Aria
You almost remember what they name is
I feel like this but niggas dont know hes stressed
Indian hair no moccasins
Throw your cash thats cake and icing

And came before you barely even got the tape in
Dont worry about what we cant control

I took the T off out the word cant
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints

Plus all the trips to Rio couldnt have helped
To whom much is given much is tested
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
Uh and you gon question me
YeYeezys please be easy
Cuffed up and hosed down pimped up and hod down
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
Every time I popped up like the VCR
Let that man get past
Anything but us is who we are
Oh I remember now its something that I dreamed of
You know that niggas cant read
I aint ever been scurred
To my ears at years old
I mean Thats my favorite CD that I play at my crib
Her allure is more couture tailormade
And Im feelin it right now cause its the time when my heart got shot down
Reluctantly because most of this press dont fuck wit me
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
All that talkin I feed off of keep it up
So say my name like Candyman
Not even electives Not even prerequits
Im living in the future so the present is my past
I bet you they show off their token blackie
This way
Im talkin only for a night I wouldnt wife her
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
Burn Hollywood burn

Now lets go take em back to the plan
And well do anything when the times right

Tell me how do you respond to students
George Bush got the answers

She wanna see if itll fit right

And fuck a bus the Benz is parked like Rosa
So I can stay out of reach they used to say Youse a producer
Oooh that shit gotta hurt

But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
That could go from bein stripper to a super CEO
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
All your Mama ever made was trophies right

Let it fall let it crash burn slow
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence

Piss on your grave piss on your grave piss on your grave
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
I know a lot of people mad cause they aint with you
Imagine if I aint say somethin
Times of the essence I need you to be spontaneous
For the road to riches and diamond rings
But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Right now I can see it so vivid
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
If you aint fit girl Ill still hit girl

Chainsmokin every day at least a couple packs
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Anything you mightve
And if you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault
So hey maybe we can make it to Christmas
Tonight Im finna hop up in that hotel pool
But Ima let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I cant keep my cool so I keep it true
I need to talk to somebody pastor
Put your Blackberry down
And I just want my credit
Thats so novice Im so polished
Now drunk textin
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Cassius in his prime coloring out of the line
It feel like LA it feel like Miami
I can see it through the lens of my Raybe
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Im high up on the line you could get behind me
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Her man in the store tryna try his best
Im just saying how I feel man
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
Breakneck speeds passenger seat something pretty
But everything that I felt was more bogus
It seems we living the American dream
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
Hopping out the van screams from the fans
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Look back on my life and my life gone
Yo yo yo
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And then my phone started ringing
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
This for the fam do this for the fam
Lookin out my loft windows man my dreams became true
I dont need writers I might bounce ideas
Hard to believe in God your nigga got killed
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
They say people in your life for seasons
Cant wait till they say Ye ran up at the Oscars
They call me Edward Scissorhands cause Im trying to cut
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out
On to the next saga
Shit they say the best things in life are free
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
You say he get on your fucking nerves
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
So I did what they aint expect from him
Get everything that bein at the top includes
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
How you gon be mad on vacation
Im not loving you the way I wanted to
And I just always like
Feelin lied to like parents never said you adopted
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
I been thinking
And have my niggas bring all the toast in
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
That lil thing by the hospital bed itll stop beepin
Why is yall
If this is your first time hearin this
Man the drama is so enticing
But when we get together be electric slidin
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
In what he dreamed
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
In the penthouse position
Now he
I see its Dolce Gabbana
Turn this up teacher play this in the third grade
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
To know some if we both honest
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
Man the flow so cold chicken soup wont help
Cause we takin these muhfuckers back to school
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
A lot of people say thats where Ye is
See Ive abducted you
You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
My homie called me like what up man
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
Number one question theyre askin
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Only rock things made for a king
At least you know thats what Im good at
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
That mean it wasnt even poppin if it not for us
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Good morning on this day we become legendary
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
But I cant take another minute of it at all
I aint gotta say it man dawg trust me
I will destroy
You messin up my mo my whole mood told you oh
Or was it on the first party
Im just the God of everything else
So we can finally fly off into NASA
I get it custom you a customer
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
Your mouth running but where is you going
Come through ya block and air people
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
Its something that the pastor dont preach
Every time I see the news man it bring me home
You know what that mean Im fly to death
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
Bottle service head service I came in first place
Tell em give me fifty million or Ima quit
My Momma couldnt get through to me
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
Somebody pour her another cup
But Im looking for the one have you seen her
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
Then she said she impregnated thats the night your heart died
I mean Ill be your con man Ill be your damn liar
But since they all lovers I need more rubbers
I dont wanna say nothin wrong
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone

She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
So go ahead and just pose

Rap god Greek mythology
I wanna break up the scene and see you running back to me
Blocka blocka blockablocka blocka
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Yeah I got some jokes dont I

Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
Till then Ill be pouring out my soul
They dont want nothin

I try to jack off he ask me who is you playin wit
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
They dont share the love but theyre up to something
Now tell me when to go tell me where the hoes

My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Praises due to the most high Allah

While we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man

And Imma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
But I aint even gonna act holier than thou
Im a legend
I see those flashing lights cause every night every night I put on
I know it was foul baby
And I say brother dont let your guards down
You get to flirtin play her just perfect
You just a commentator if you getting paper
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Long for their shot on the TV screens
Im goin Bobby Boucher
I dreamt of Pac he asked me Are you still down
Thats when you die hard
When I get back you gon take that
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
Im about to hit the Ye button
But I Dont Say a Word Ill never tell
So I close my eyes
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
But can I please give her these flowers
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
But first you gon remember how to forget
Hundred degrees drop the roof so the coupe dont melt
Abbey Lee too Im a freak boo
Heres another fight oh here we go
Pardon Im getting my scream on
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
Lets see who really rich
Unbreakable what you thought theyd call me Mr Glass
Who is that in the Phantom please no cameras
I treat the label like money from my shows
When they taste level aint at my waist level
Dumb you fuckin up my mode man
Its am and were just starting again
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Baby you up uestion mark
Im so appalled Spalding ball
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
Imma play this Vandross you gon take your pants off
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
Young Walt Disney Ima tell you truthfully
Really Doe got a different type of plastic on him
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Never been the type to bite my words
Sometimes I still talk to her
Just tryin to take you where the stars gonna surround you
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Was it something I did wrong
Tryin to show yo legs off you aint Amerie
thousand dollar fur for Nori I just copped it Yo
If I dont get ran out by Catholics black
Half of thats to Cindys
And the weather wasnt barely hot
But I feel like Michael Jordan Scottie Pippen at my weddin
And Im feeling like Mike at his Baddest
To the victims of welfare for we livin in Hell here hell yeah
These execs
DC PG or ATL
What you rappers could get is a job from me
And then you call upon God
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Was just a secretary worked for the church for years
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
After all of that you received this
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
Primetime basking in the lime
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
What you want a Bentley Fur coat A diamond chain
Never meet ya mother girl
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
√Åndale √Åndale EI EI uh oh
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
We aint got nothing to lose motherfucker we rolling
We aint going nowhere but got suits and cases
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
I mean I promise yall
Every bouncer every club show her extra love
Maybach bumper sticker reads What would Hova do
Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like this
If Nike aint have Drizzy man they wouldnt have nothin woo
He walked in our lives I was only five
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
Yeah I told you to wait
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
He just talkin mines outside
In Jesus name let the choir say
Dashiki kimono or turban
Now its gon be a problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr Christohper Wallace
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali
All want something out me
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
Like The Pips at their gladdest
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
She said uh
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
I should hire this bitch she so damn good at Photoshop
And its just so amazing So amazing so amazing
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
You can go head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
Was in the club was in the club
I want a good girl she want a gentleman
All want the details
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty much
But still supported me when I did the opposite
We done heard all that loudass talking were used to it
Seen or heard
And so instead of sending flowers were the roses
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Like Eli I did it jokes on you motherfucker and I get it
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
For the team
No sports bra lets keep it bouncin
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up
Knowin I cant afford to get mo Get mo
Thats my reality so get off my Scott Disick
And then you look in the sky you got some questions to ask
She claim she got cramps Im gone get you to suck
Stop all your blood clot cryin I was flyin

She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
So goodnight cruel world Ill see you in the morning
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Police escorts everybody passports
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
I got my superman power my superman cape
The ice and me chill
Dressed smart like a London bloke before he speak his suit bespoke
Would you be with JayZ if he wasnt CEO
And Ill admit I had fell in love with Kim
Black Timbs all on your couch again
So they could never say we never lived it
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
If you pass on a Kan beat thats your last fault
Cant hide from the truth yeah were bout to go ape
I only like green faces
I feel like its still bitches that owe me sex
I put on everybody that I knew from the Go
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
But if you dont need a fix girl you gotta leave
Wwwhen they violate bbut
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Youre my questions youre my proof
That seem to only date the head of football teams
Now I dont know what the hell this song is talkin bout
Or Jay is
No I seen it in her eyes
But when Ali turn up and be Ali you cant ever change that nigga back to Cassius
Nigga with an attitude I feel like OShea
I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
And Im doing pretty hood in my pink polo
And from that point I never blow her off
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
You know what it is when were outta town
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
Man this is an insult
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
Always rockin that this aint out yet
Up late night like she on patrol
Especially when you got family members on payroll
What if we fucked at this Vogue party
How you feel they say we crazed cause our styles so diff
Since my money get right theses days

Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
As far as my business
Damn baby pussy cant be your only hustle
Please to meet ya its a pleasure knowing me
Thought youd be different bout it
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
Give up the women
Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin
I be paranoid every time

And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Baby thats because you the other half of me
But I remember the brain here go a fare for the train and
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him

On nights when Ye romance
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you

She stopped drinking Diet Coke
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
I have porno stars and spouses
I asked her you buying
Yeah I thought you could wait
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And now you wanna get me back
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Every time I breathe on a track I asthma attack it
Before I break now ah ah ah ah
We lost a four leaf clover
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of
And I dont even wanna hear bout what niggas might do
Or or leave the club now
We dont give a fuuuhuhuck
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
You should just go and throw a cape on

We dont care what people say
But I been talking to God for so long
Im as Chi as buckfiftys and Pelle Pelle Leathers
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Aint no question who about to kill em
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
Momma pass in Hollywood
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Brother dont let your guard down
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
She got one of your kids got you for eighteen years
See before I let you go
I dont let em play with me
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
A monster about to come alive again
You aint built like that
Always said what the fuck I felt
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man

This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
