I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
Cause they've never been out on their own
And we're gonna drive around
No regret for the path that I chose
Love is pretty when love is new
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua Joshua Joshua
Side by side, we'll be together always
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
Went down that Georgia Line
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall
For the hard times we've been through We've squeezed the life from every dream
Wantin' me as much as I want you [Chorus] Makes me blue
And I'm sorry that I'm not
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
With really nothin' left to hold onto Oh, why do we keep holding on
We both know that I'm not
Hey hey yeah Do you need another mule skinner
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Facing fifty years old
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Laugh and sing
So please, oh, please don't stop loving me You're my inspiration, my purpose in life
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep. I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
When love is new it's magic. Verse 1: Mother, oh Mother, why can't you see
And I do I'll be good to him
I'm making plans for the tear drops
That he was meant for me, ooh To know, know, know him
We're having our own party two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
I want to kiss your smile
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are Oh, and these northern nights are dreary
When there are no more wars to fight
But it's too late to love me now It's too bad
Made of sand, made of sand
I still love you so Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
Nothing is above me
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
As they did when you picked them for me Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
Now and on into eternity From here to the moon and back
With nothing left to hold onto
When it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Though we'd only met
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
That fell on the dress that she wore
Couldn't lift me very high
We fight and kill each other
It won't be the same with her gone
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
In my Tennessee mountain home
I have needed you so long
But we'd spent our lives on credit
I'd come runnin' back to you
And half in fear the day
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
It wouldn't be the same But suddenly the air was filled
Should be keepin' us apart But you know that I love you
Like sunlight from the skies
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
I would only be in your way
Somewhere between me and you
How do you keep it?"
Were content to be lost in the crowd
"Welcome home!" Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home. You ought to go north somebody told us
I'd come runnin' back to you But you know we can't
Play a song, let your banjo ring Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday
We're gonna buy some real good car
He's alive He's alive
We start and end as one, in love forever
Only will be peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
We're so lost and confused Hello God, are you out there?
But you know I love you
And as I looked into His eyes
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
This i know, this i know
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
Here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry
They split up the money
And we all gathered here
Side by side we'll be together always
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And I wanted so much to branch out So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
9 to 5, for service and devotion
My old southern heart is weary
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
My love, my love, what have I done
It's just your haunting memory Those memories of you still haunt me
We found the stone and empty tomb
And there got all my defenses
Save the last dance for me
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Just because I'm a woman There's a picture that I carry
Lord, you go insane if you give in to it
You might have brought somebody else Just let me tell you this
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine (Dolly Parton) Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin'
But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone
How can we be wrong
Needs no conversation
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
I've wasted love but I still have some more The bargain store is open come inside
And bring you
Hello God, hello, hello This old world has gone to pieces
Get to livin'
Can we fix it, is there time?
When God sees her comin'
Guilt in my confusion
Oh, I love you And how I wish that love
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
Left Tim and I all alone
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Before the next teardrop falls (Dolly Parton) My life is like unto a bargain store
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies Love is like a butterfly
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
She never meant to come back home
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
Love enough to make amends
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
I'll go through hell And back again
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' through Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh travelin' through. Well I can't tell you where I'm going, I'm not sure of where I've been
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
You are a reacher, so reach down Won't you reach out and lead me
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you. All you gotta do is smile that smile
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
Then I saw Him die Back inside the house again
But listen and understand
But I just can't keep holdin' on
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Happy, happy birthday baby
When things go all wrong, you make them all right
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine Trouble clouds may fill our skies
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
Farewell to all you ladies and to all who knew me when
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
Anything you ask for
'Cause only you can satisfy
Hello, God; hello, God Nobody believes that I really care for you
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
When you and father first married Oh, yes, I do remember it well.
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
When your dreams are all shattered
An' he's gonna marry me Yeah, he's gonna marry me
Seems like years ago we met
So darlin', save the last dance for me Baby don't you know I love you so
She hurts deep and when she weeps
Round and round, round and round Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
I'm not acting like a lady
To know know know him
They will vow to always love you
A little more willin' to make a better way
Yellow roses
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
We never had a lot but we got by
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
She's as mad as an old wet hen
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
But we're here to learn, the spirit burns, to know the greater truth
That he didn't kiss and hold her
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you [Chorus] We'll always be together, you and I Forever together, forever you and I
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
And, yes, I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you
And as he began to read it
Where should they begin
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
Sittin' on the front porch swing When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases
I hurried to the window
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die But I ain't been home in I don't know when
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
And she never missed the flowers
I'm just a weary pilgrim
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Only for you
And if it gets too rough
Please don't take him just because you can You could have your choice of men
To offer up a few words of advice. Chorus:
She's a friend and she's a wife
And a voice began to call
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Oh the sorrow never ends Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But our dreams all fell in on us
At a greasy spoon cafe
On a day I can't forget
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls Though it hurts to let you go
When the father and the son say
But he just didn't frighten me
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
Making conversation with the new love I've found
Can you hear me, are you listenin' any more?
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
And Jesus stood before me
For a country girl with a friendly face
Patty cake and bakersman
So the garden, one day, set me free I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me! They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
And now His body isn't there We both ran towards the garden
His beard and his hair was long and black
And I heard somebody say well who are you
I'm just traveling through ooho ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. Oh sometimes the road gets rugged
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Till it's time to go
And it's hard to travelin' on
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
From thirty odd years Starting over again
In the pale moonlight
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
Crickets sing in the fields near by (Dolly Parton/Carl Perkins) When it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
Hello God, please forgive us
They never got that far
She's gone home to glory
I become a hero
Redemption comes in many shapes with many kinds of pain
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By"
She's an everlasting shoulder
Was sent from you Yellow roses
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
Just a friend from long ago
'Cause you're making plans to leave Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
You know I'm a lifetime gaurantee So if they ask you what you mean to me
To ring the church bell
Guide me and keep me, Lord
We'll just live our lives one day at a time You packed in the morning
These old southern eyes are teary
Darling I want you to know
More than this I love you as you are
Half in hope of sorrow
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
Like a tree shedding its leaves
To solve the problems day to day, in the family You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
Thought I'd drop a line to say
To stop my tears
Hate and violence just increases
But I will always love you
You say you need me and it's too late
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
That she's made you shed a tear
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
Sweet Jesus New York City ain't no kind of place
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings
And there'll be no sadness and no sorrow, no trouble I see
Why you're just what I've been looking for
I'll be with you Until the end If you go, I'll follow you
Why he let me love in vain I am not a little sparrow
Just seems to be so good
I know you're married but I love you still You broke a heart dear that would die for you
Every beat of my heart
I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find my own way home
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
To laugh and talk
Expecting swords and torches
For I couldn't live with you gone
Yes, I can see where I may be misjudged upon first glance.
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
We got a better thing, baby
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
She moved in with her sisters
So he's gotta marry me
His touch just takes my breath away.
I heard something at the wall
All i need is your love to make me stronger [Repeat chorus] (Dolly Parton) Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
And two doors down they're all aware that I'm around
They will crush you like a sparrow
As I'm stumbling tumbling
My daddy's drunk again in town
I think about where you might be
My son, my very own... Welcome home." But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
I still said yes
He's alive He's alive He's alive
Drifting like a floating boat
Or I won't accept your pay
Just to let a no good man Call every cent of my pay
Dear God, don't let us go
I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
I know what's beautiful
It's just plain jealousy
Drifting like a floating boat and roaming like the wind
Once my love for you was so great
Oh, the free will you have given
I have questioned your existence,
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
Whatcha doing living here all alone
You're gonna see a change in me God made me for a reason
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
Cut momma's apron strings
There's a window that I can't see through
And tall as a sycamore tree
Leaving you to never mend Little sparrow, little sparrow
When you think about love, think about me
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
And all the king's men
I often think about that Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
But they're having a party just two doors down I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
Can you hear us, are you listenin' any more?
Oh i could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
Better start tryin'
