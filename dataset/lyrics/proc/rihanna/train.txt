You know I'm saucy
What now? Please tell me
I don't wanna do this
I'm so happy, you came in my life 'Cause you know how to give me that
I say I won't be long
For too long, that's wrong (But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch
Sometimes it's you I can't stand
Must be love on the brain
So amazing Everywhere is still
Give it to me baby, gi-gi give it to me baby One and two and a three and four
All my life on my head
Hey boy, I wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type Ooh na na na na
you gave it to me,
Cardiac arrest, cardiac a wrist
Tell me that she couldn't get this sting
When the world has dealt its cards
All you need to do is love me, yeah
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
I've been everywhere, man
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
Man Down!
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby) What are you willing to do
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
We gonna light up the night Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
I love to party
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Right in front of my eyes
I will throw my hands up 'cause baby I tried
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) I think I've had enough
He wanna feel my summer rain
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
Don't try to hide it
Is nothing without you All I've got, is nothing without
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Ghost in the mirror
Anymore
Now where's your heartbeat
Baby you're a challenge
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
Love me, love me (yeah) Tonight
Take it easy
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
You've gotta do more than tell me what your feeling
Sometimes I love you
No baby just one, one, one
This just looks like a re-run
Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be happy
My fragrance on and they love my smell
Looking at your pictures Boy, How could you lie to me
'She can almost be the worst of me'
But it's over now
Next time you wanna go on and leave
Everybody putcha glasses up and I drink to that
That's the part I can't forget
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And all of a sudden you went and left
I'll be gone by night Can't you see that your fading
I opened up my eyes
Cause if you want me, want me, want me
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
It ain't that black and white
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
Slipped into a peril that
You took the time to figure me out
Everything with you is so complicated
But chains and whips excite me 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
And that's when you need me there
Move both ya feet and run to the beat Run, run, run, run
It's okay, don't be alarmed, come in to me
I never meant to let it get so, personal
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!
But love is a game so fuck what you sayin' [Chorus]
And I know it seems wrong to accept
(Ella ella, eh eh eh eh,eh eh) These fancy things will never come in between
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
Maybe fake's what I like
And then you kiss my lips
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, yeah They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
Get a little crazy, baby Do you like it boy
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
You know I like it rough
And shut someone
I got a secret I'mma drop em to the floor, ooh No teasin',
Today will be better babe
It's only up from here, no downward spiral
Please don't call me on my bluff
And he tryna put his name on it
You should just let me why you will never let me grow When I look outside my window
And then I get, a scary thought
All I see is dollar signs
Oh, right away
Hands up
And a little last night on these sheets
We gonna light up the night
I drink to that. (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah) Life's too short to be sittin' round miserable
And I'm hope, now
To think, i why wanna
The night-time is the right time I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
Stop thinking you're the only option (But you make the same old mistakes)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life Hey, never mind what haters say
You'd still be wastin' days away
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby Been waiting on that sunshine boy, I think I need that back
Or see it from this way around
And someone can say they love me truly
It seems like more than distance between us In this California king bed
Da very moment gone you know I miss you
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
and every breath that's in between.
I finally know what it's like
And even then my eyes got wetter
You really had me goin'
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
Searching for you babe Where have you been?
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
As your shadow crosses mine
Ooh, ooh Ooh na na, what's my name
We're not making love, tryna get nasty
And I know, I'm wishing free
Babe, if I don't feel it I ain't faking
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets
Just to get close to you
We gotta take time with this
Moo-la-lah
You can be anything at all
When you a guh ner ner ner ner ner ner!
The thunder roll yeah he wanna bang
We gonna light up the night I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
Ooh do what you gotta do, keep me up all night (all night)
Never thought I'd do it, never thought I'd do it!
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Million dollar voice, came through the phone

Sometimes I don't understand
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
Cuz I know I'm a victory
Hold me like you (Nobody)
Baby you have got the keys to my heart
And she was right, hmm
We were always just that close
That was quite a show
Like I once made 'em spray

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard Go hard or go home
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Yeah boy I like it yeah boy I like it
Go deep,
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
And I know that it's no more
It should have been me and you
Impartial to the politics
Acting acting silly boy? [Hook: Future] I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
She's begging me and asking why it's over Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
So why did it have to happen,
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
I'm livin' my life, my life
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, ow
All my life I've been everywhere, man
Got me like ah-ah-ah-ow
But the hottest bitch in heels right here
But you called 'bout a thousand times
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving Not really sure how to feel about it
You and I
Boy you got me messed up
La la la la I want you to love me,
Common sense is out the door, can't seem to find a lot
When you're breaking it down for me
Hurting vibe, man, and it hurts inside when I look you in your eye What are you willing to do
Love me all night long
We die forever We gone forever
And you take that to new extremes
If you hit me back up

The fact that you ain't around
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
Some a thinks so wow
Sitting in the kitchen gettin sad

Send for me Woo (feel me up, feel me up)
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
I'mma give it to you harder
'Cause it seems that wrong
Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart, this time
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
And it's not even my birthday
And I... had as much as I can take
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
Long distance I need you
Baby don't you leave
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
Even if I left today and stayed away

How long did we last?
Say you liking how I feel,
One time for your mind say it (Yeah Yeah) Well I'm ready for ya

My soul is awry and without asking why
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky

Hurt hurt hurt hurt hurting Dry! ...me a desert him
Most times I wanna kiss you
Throw it up, throw it up
Now the pain is for pleasure
Love me, love me (yeah) Love me
Girl in the world
That keeps me so off balance
Something in the way you move
You leave a breakin keep
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
I know my mistakes,
Come in to me, come in to me
Somewhere in the crowd Where have you been?
If I'm your girl say my name boy
Got nothing without you, you, you
Tell me what's a girl to do
The high life No we won't say no
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
And still you insist on repeatedly trying
In front of a big ol crowd
Beautiful people say yes Hands out stretch, what you got
No, I don't want you no more (get outta here) Silly boy (silly boy)
I hear the pain in her voice
I'll be California wishing on these stars
I'll get some flowers for the day that you are buried
Turn it around with another round
Just cut it out Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
The clouds are rolling in
But the dunce cap is off
In a new direction
No Lord, Lord knows, this shit be everything
and love is a long way down. Loving you is suicide
Relax
But I'm not sure, you're running low, lately
Sorrow in my soul
But he can be anything at all
I finally know what is love (you don't have what it takes)
It doesn't have to feel so strange
but my brain is wired wrong.
I hope that you see this through
And end a n****, end a n**** life so soon?
Shouldnt've hit it like that, had me yellin' like that
All black on, blacked out shades
Somehow you got me where it really hurts
Ever happened to me, ever happened to me?
Your love, your love, your love
And so me put in work work work work work work!
You bout to break me,
Oh why I'ma stick around just a little while longer
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
I might do a little time
When u ah guh
You can stand under my umbrella (Ella ella, eh eh eh)
I love the way you lie Take a breath, take it deep
Just start loving me (loving me) Oh, and babe I'm fist fighting with fire
And now I feel like Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
When I breathe in too deep
Yeah, yeah I ain't tryin' to think about it, no
Ooh, ooh Story of my life
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it Boy, you know you got me feeling open
So baby don't stop what you're doing
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
Your love, your love, your love Like a flame that flickers in
You spent some time away
Now I know that you're up tonight
Bitch better have my money! Bitch better have my Like brrap, brrap, brrap Bitch better have my Like brrap, brrap, brrap
As we moonshine and molly
I still got my money
Young girl, hustlin'
Can't remember what you did (But I hate it) You know exactly what to do
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
Yeah, I said it Oh yeah
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
So I can feel alive again
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I'm too good to you
I need love and affection
So just pull the trigger As my life flashes before my eyes
Must be love on the brain I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I don't know how to cry
Sometimes it helps
In front of a big ol' crowd
That's why i'm loving you when you're not here.
(Get, get no peace oh) Hmm stupid in love
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
So who cares about what I spend
And now you want it like,
I better become your only
I'm so hard (So hard) ah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
But you insist on repeatedly trying
The square root of sixty nine is eight something, right?
And your kiss won't make me weak
Back to your residence
My love is your love, your love is mine We stay moving around, solo
Every door you enter, I will let you in Hey boy I really wanna see
There's a party at the bar
Tryin' to get away from loving ya You know how to love me hard
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Used to love you, used to love you You're not easy to love
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Chasin' this American Dream
I've been California wishing on these stars
Throw it, throw it up
And I drink to that.
I'm no good without you
I'm so hard,(So hard) yeah, yeah, yeah,
Instead of bein' gracious
I don't care I'm in love (stop before it's too late)
Had it by a bladder, she like "oh I gotta pee"
This is a velvet, forfeit the what
By the way, what's his name
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up
Him ah go act like him nuh like it
No time to think, my turn to go And you can see my heart, beating,
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
I can't keep track
Because it's so done
Turn the music up Hey Mr.
So silly boy get out my hair, my hair (get outta here)
Send for me
Ohh Money on my mind
I need me a remedy, been looking for remedies
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
This is me and you, you're my superstar
Back in the day was cool and all
No I don't want you no more (get outta here) Silly boy (silly boy)
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
so light as a dove,
Uh
'Cause, baby, you're my disease Come here rude boy, boy
Why do you waste your time?
But I'm struggling
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
I don't know what to do, it's true
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
Game's over, You lose Cause you had a good girl, good girl (girl)
I'mma throw it at ya,
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
And every time I walk out the door
Everybody on the floor let me show you how we do
Walking around with mama in Marc's
What were you thinking [Chorus: Rihanna & Chris Brown]
Looked like me and two of my boys playing casino
Turn away cause I need you more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I'm a Survivor
That's how much I need you
I need a boy to take it over
And now my heart's dead
Ask us where you at, we don't know
Side by side, you were sleeping next to me
Everything is never ending
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Be in love again I'm not the type to get my heart broken
Love me (yeah)
What now? Ohhhh what now? I found the one he changed my life
And it kills him inside
Feel so good, oh
You can run over me
With you, I'll always share Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
As he reluctantly
Take a peek and run away, running from
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum, bum rum bum bum bum
And I can't get enough
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
Just close your eyes and breathe Breathe out, breathe in
Show me what you got now Come here right now Take it, take it
Yeah I don't wanna be alone
Lot mo' where dat came from
I can't get no peace of mind oh Let me cover your shit in glitter
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
A murderer I feel it in the air
We found love in a hopeless place Shine a light through an open door
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Woo woo (feel me up, feel me up) Tell me 'bout your picture perfect darling
Wanna feel your skin
If you play, you play the key
Cause if you really wanna be alone
Hold me like a pillow
You know how to love me hard
No jeans,
You ain't leaving me behind
You take my love for granted
To be, I why wanna
When she's crying inside
Survivor, survivor Gyeah, Rihanna
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)
All I wanna see you in
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
Okay, away we go
I come riding in on a pale white horse
Get it over with
You should just let me, will you ever respect me? No
You got me moaning now
Pour it up, pour it up
Come on light my fire
The hootin' and the hollerin'
I know you're a better man
Know that we'll still have each other
Love me like you do [Verse 3: Chris Brown]
(Ella ella, eh eh eh eh,eh eh) It's raining, raining
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Girl you use to rock my world, ah
Now you can see it through my chest
And you and I shake off the ready for wow
I left the engine running
This is the high life
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
No skirt,
If you had a twin I would still choose you
Dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt!
Feels like I drown in your every word
Love me, love me Come here rude boy, boy
It's pouring rain, it's pouring rain
In seasons you say "It's okay, you think little things to me"
Go on, be gone, bye bye, so long Can't you see that your fading
Beautiful people say yes
He says, close your eyes
Your phone don't even ring
Don't understand it blood on your hands
I've been waiting up all night
Don't leave me stuck here in the streets uh huh
I will lose my cool, and reach for my fire arm I didn't mean to lay him down
Like brrap, brrap, brrap Louis XIII and it's all on me, nigga you just bought a shot
Even angels have their wicked schemes
My California king
I'mma hit it like I'm on it
Everybody putcha glasses up and I drink to that (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
When you put it down
When the clouds come, we gone We Roc-A-Fellas
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
Love me, love me Mustard on the beat ho! I was good on my own, that's the way it was
It's like you were my favorite drug
That ego's hurting
Last night I got high as the expectations
Rihanna, where you at? You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
S, S, S and M, M, M Oh I love the feeling you bring to me
See a down me now
Promise you'll pay my bail
I won't lie, I'm falling hard
Run it back like you owe me something Woo, woo (feel me up, feel me up)
The life, my life
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead
Where have you been, all my life? I've been everywhere, man
Worried 'bout every trait
These days you been feeling like
Toe to toe
Giddy up, babe Tonight
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum
What else is on? And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
And I took his heart when
You're not easy to love, no Why is everything with you so complicated
Man Down, tell the judge please gimme minimal
To show me where you are tonight I've been everywhere, man
Gold all up in my grill
When the war has took its part
Give it to me strong
You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky
But its too late to turn back now
That I, I, I Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go
We are the new America
Take three, action No clouds in my storms
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Can't nobody, baby (Can't nobody love me)
Hold on tighter if you going my way Oh, baby, oh, still a long way to go
Ain't nothing left to talk about
But you'll always be my hero
Ooh darling would you mind giving my reflection a break
I didn't know how to follow
I said, boy; I'm telling you, you got me open
And you come running after me and baby I'm back with you Oh, you're not easy to love
Ghost in the mirror
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
Yeah, yeah
Turn on your cameras, it's something to see [Pre-Chorus]
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
And knew, a need is money
I just came to see
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you And last night I think I lost my patience
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright tonight,
I ain't standin around crying no more
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
You should just let me, why you will never let me grow? When I look outside my window
Like boom, boom, boom
You the one that I'm loving
What's up One and two and a three and four
Yellow diamonds in the light
Got my mind made up
I want you to stay It's not much of a life you're living
(You better hurry up)
Yeah, look I don't know how to talk to you
You so excited
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
Dancing in the dark Here's a little story I've gotta tell
Please don't stop the music, music, music
I just don't understand it
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Lets go dip it low then you bring it up slow
Do, you wanna do
Can't figure out how you stole my heart My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
Stay up off my Instagram with your temptation
Just too bad for you, that when you had me
Come and put your hands up to the ceiling Okay everybody get down if you feel me
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin' heart? Baby like ah, woo, ah
You know I dealt with you the nicest
We've both had our hearts broken
You're so ugly when you cry
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard Ah yeah, yeah, yeah that Rihanna reign just won't let up
What you need to do is be thankful
It could have been you and me
I'm blowing you away Things just ain't the same
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
I'm going numb, I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed
Shawty must've heard, got the word, I move that D
I'll never understand
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
What goes on between us no one has to know
Oh mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down (Criminal)(In central station) Said, "I'd never thought I'd do it
everything is restless in my heart
Go on and take a bow And the award for the best liar goes to you
So silly boy get out my hair, my hair(Get outta here)
Now all I got are these photographs All I've got, all I've got
I bet you wanna know You the one that I dream about all day
and my world's about to break
Don't it mean I love you
Come here rude boy, boy
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night
And it's sick that all these battles
Every little city I go, fuck me
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Homage I think they should pay
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Shining bright like a diamond
In a different way than I was using you
Laid in a, midnight hour
Hmmmm You know I got the sauce (sauce)
It's like I checked into rehab
I know that I must pass this test
Then turn around and follow TIP
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Your hands around my waist just let the music play
Why window shop
Love and affection
So start me up and watch me go, go, go Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
And start being thankful for what you do got
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
Tryin' to apologize
That's how much I need you (I need you) And I hate that I love you so
Come on baby,
My heart knows better Why is everything with you so complicated
A murderer Our love, his trust
Who cares when it feels like crack?
We can go a little longer
You'd do anything for the one you love
Put it all on my card tonight, yeah
Close to you
Just take it on back, boy take it on back boy
Sometimes I feel like we will be together forever
Today, today, it's too late
And I don't know how to describe (Stop before it's too late)
I know you don't think it's right
I know you hearin' it,
All I see is signs
And I want it all
Other times I'm like where are you on the page
I'm going dumb with all my friends
Any way, any day
Only thing I want from you, is for you to (stay away) I said i`m not coming back

Soon the red dogs will give the block back to the presidents
So me put in work work work work work work
Close to you I been ignoring this big lump in my throat
Point is I have the right
I can work miracles
Oh why Sometimes I get you
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Takes, I whys wanna
And I've, got all the symptoms
I'mma need you deeper than six, not a coffin

Good weed, white wine, uh
My pocket's deep, and they never end
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Turn it down,
Ain't nobody, baby no

You're fading away Put a sock in it

They ain't hard as this
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
My love is your love, your love is mine And yes I'm kinda crazy

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays

And we know it very well 'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
Dancing in the dark Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
I wanna go back to the old way
But no matter what you'll never see me cry This time was different
Yes, it's a lesson, and it's based on my vanity
But it's too late to think of the value of my life And you can see my heart, beating,
Every time I walk out the door
I like it, like it Love is great, love is fine
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Must be love on the brain Baby, keep loving me
and it's getting harder everyday.

You know them haters
It's like the darkness is the light
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rear view mirror racin'
Why you acting silly boy?
Good Girl Gone Bad
Your train of thought will be altered
A man whose heart is hollow uh
Never know, no, both flying out of here yeah
For you to be listenin to your silly home girls
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty

Will you ever let me? Will you ever respect me? No
Love it when you talk that talk to me, yeah What you saying now, give it to me baby
Something that I never had
But I don't wanna be alone If you want

See all of my kindness
From the pain it's feeling now? I got to do things my own way darling
Keep on rockin' to it

Put your mind into a happy photograph Ain't no worry at all, I'm getting stronger everyday
Turn the music up Okay everybody get down if you feel me
Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea
It's not healthy for me to feel this
'Cause all of my kindness
Everybody right here,
(Making the same mistakes)
Don't give a fuck but I'm celibate
Love me (Take it) Take it, take it
Silly boy boy (boy boy)
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
But they feel like words to me
They say that money talk, tell these other neegas speak up
Disturbia
And when I'm with you give me some
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
I like when you tell me move it there So giddy up
(Stop before it's too late) Man, I know that it is hard to digest
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
He is not the one
But now that I know it's not meant to be
Woo (I don't even really love you)
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothing
S.O.S. please someone help me
If I'm on your mind
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
That I love you beyond a reason why
Send for me (woo)
Now where's your heart beat
Unlike you, Chris Brown and Rihanna:
For your heart on me, my California king My California king
Oh

How you take advantage of the fact
I don't even really care about you no more Send for me
I feel the love but I don't feel that way Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me yeah
'Bout to make me crazy
Can you handle the curves, can you run all the lights
I hate the way this feels
Can't even get it started
The sex doesn't get any better, make it long, let it be all night
Na, na-ah Come here rude boy, boy

Best believe we've gone forever
(Stop before it's not too late)

And now I'm mad
Oh make it last all night, night Take me for a ride, ride
The future seemed so bright
It can control you
Never know, no, just want out of here yeah
Repeat chorus Both:
Promise that you'll never leave me in the dark
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Ooh, ooh Hey boy I really wanna see
And I drink to. I've been looking for a driver who is qualified
Stop thinking you're the only option (Come on)
So I surrender, to every word you whisper
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
And you up out of poverty
Thinkin' "How could I be so reckless?"
And I wanna tell you my intentions
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
You lovin' me, yeaah
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin (shockin)
Then I say I'm through with you
I should've never let you enter my door
L-o-v-e and affection [Verse 3: Future] Can you love me for poor
Ooh (ooh)
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive
Lord knows, I must be a 10
Now had I never saved the day
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Hold on tighter if you going my way Steady as you go hold your hand in mine
Take it back all night
And I hate that I love you so (ooh) And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)
He said, if you dare come a little closer Round and around and around and around we go
That without them, you feel like nothing
and so tempted to pull out your IV
I swear you got me losing my mind Ooh na na, what's my name
Every night, every day
Tonight,
Can't nobody baby (Ain't nobody love me now)
No fear, and while you getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
And it's killing every part of me. Loving you is suicide.
I wanna dance in the dark
Shit was never us
Love and life I will divide
Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you know Not really sure how to feel about it
I told her no, she cried Te amo
That Rihanna reign, just won't let up
You know where I be, too hard Where dem girls talkin' trash, where dem girls talkin' trash
You can see it through my chest
Tonight
I just don't understand it I don't know how to talk to you
But some things need perfection,
I don't know what to feel
With their record sales just holler TIP
In central station Little 22, I call her Peggy Sue
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
Breathing down my neck,
Don't press your luck today, today
Killin' these hoes

Something that you've never seen
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefa
Bitch better have my money Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Talk that talk to me, yeah
Hit a switch on a fake nigga like a station
You're not easy to love
You won't see me cry This time was different
Arm in arm, dusk to dawn with the curtains drawn
Cause a n**** might push up on it
Shine bright like a diamond So shine bright
All I've got are these photographs
Let me see you try to live without me
Ooh, that's all I want And I know that you're up tonight
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Two keys back to my place, we were having no fun
whoa, whoaa.
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Used to love you, used to love you
Baby, come in to me
And people gon' talk whether you doing bad or good, yeah
With a little bit too much to say Ghost in the mirror
Breathe in, this feeling
Live like we're gonna die
Baby, tell me what's wrong
Rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin how many more shots until you're rollin
They tellin' me X2 Ey, this is special what's happenin' to all my
Nothing heard, nothing said
Let's escape into the music
That I'm keepin', you can come inside (yeah)
Don't give that away to no one
Ooh na na na na
What now? Somebody tell me
Stop thinking you're the only option
Sitting in a old Monte Carlo
Lemme see you move and
Baby baby baby baby baby yeah
American, American Oxygen Oh say can you see, this is the American Dream
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
My California king Eye to eye
(Woo, woo)
You telling me this, I don't wanna listen
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Bitch better have my money
Is you big enough (oh)
Must be love on the brain, yeah
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Both:
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
That's something missing Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
So I can push you off me
Bitch better have my
Turn it into an empire
And I can't stand you
I tried but it's way too late
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we? You're gonna be, a shinin' star
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Boy I know you wanna touch
My California king Just when I felt like giving up on us
Strippers goin' up and down that pole
Is nothing without you
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And look what happened to our love
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And so me put in
No, I'm too good to you
Every time I drive by, I'm the only thing you're playin'
Why could it not be the one? Why? Why? Why?
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Up against the wall, we don't need a title uh Yeah, I said it
I'm in an all white party wearin' all black
We fly higher than weather
I finally know what it's like (stop before it's too late)
Man Down! Oh mama, mama, mama
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Oh oh No heels,
Just put your skin baby on my skin No heels,
Oh oh, la la la, la la la, la la, oh oh Talk that talk to me, yeah
Like I'm a hot ride (uh yeah)
It seems like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Yeah, yeah, yeah I bet she could never make you cry
It takes me all the way
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
Give it to me baby, gi-gi give it to me baby What you saying now, give it to me baby
Flatline on the EKG Akon:
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
Where have you been, all my life? Where have you been, all my life? You can have me all you want
Saw your man in the club
Sex with me so amazing, amazing, amazing hmmmm Sex with me
Why couldn't I be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)
For your heart on me, my California king Eye to eye, cheek to cheek
Acting acting silly boy? Silly boy (silly boy)
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Ehh Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it Just your presence, and I second guess my sanity
Don't hold nothing back
Oh I hate it
Let me know I'm in control
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
(Come on)
I'm about to go insane
I choose to be happy
blacked out Maybach
And in my pocket Come and put your name on it
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
The look in your eyes, I know you want some
Will throw my hands up 'cause baby I tried
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for

But boy you stay up on it

Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you know Not really sure how to feel about it
There's no distance in between our love
So you can put me together
But baby ooh, you needed me City lights don't shine as bright when we're apart
Wanna take control,
And in my pocket
It feels like the only time you see me
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
I'm flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
But you`re not ok, tellin' me you miss my face
Sex with me, so amazing
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Can I not like you for awhile? (No) But you won't let me
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face I wanna take you away
My tummy's up in knots, as I see you, I get so hot
This time was different
Dancing in the dark I wanna dance in the dark
Watch it all fall out
I'm so hard (Too hard) that I, I, I,
See you later [Pre-Chorus]
Got nothing without you All I've got are these photographs
Just testing me, but still I'm losing it
You like sleeping alone Why is everything with you so complicated
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright
Let the bass from the speakers run through ya sneakers
That's why you take me,
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Oh oh
Been a size ten in my whole life
This is a private show Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
Cause I never leave my heart open
Didn't know how to treat her, t-t-t-t-treat her (treat her)
Just take it on back, take it on back
But no matter what you'll never see me cry How did I get here with you, I'll never know?
You waited long enough
Baby strip down for me,
They're telling me let go
Ima leave your heart broken on the floor You're gonna be in the emergency room
Four o'clock and we ain't going home
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
Might be mad in the morning
All I've got, is nothing without
I thought I would lose you,
And, boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
And he just happened to come at the right time
Take it, take it
You better learn how to treat us right
I Don't put it down
I wanna do the things that I mention
I pray for patience
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout What now? I just can't figure it out
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) Say a prayer, to yourself
So I'ma give it to you baby One and two and a three and four
Just get up on my body You`re callin' me more than ever now that we`re done
Take it home on your camera phone
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
I gotta get out
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
You gon' need it
So I made it, even though Katy
Tell 'em to give me back my swag, they tryin' to clone me
Working hard to perfect it
Just start loving me (loving me) Oh, and baby I'm fist fighting with fire
Faithful to me
And it's always wet
A cold sweat, hot headed believer
Got nothing without you Now baby it's killing me
I think I'm going to oh, oh, oh Throw on your break lights
Told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
Bitch better have my money
Yep, I'm falling for ya but there's nothin' wrong with that You the one that I dream about all day
I'm so hard, that I, I, I,
Two sides of me can't agree
Love me Take it, take it
Nothin' else like this
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Palms rise to the universe
I need it
Run through your town, I shut it down
Baby you got me like oh
(Stop before it's too late)
You were sleeping next to me
Love Love
But now it's time to go
Na na na, na na, come on
Last night, I came to a realization
That you could be
That's how we ball out
After all the game I gave away
They see me yelling into my phone
I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet)
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
I'm a fine cool supersonics speed machine
Leave, i why wanna
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Not move away 'cause they afraid
When you hold me, I'm alive
Curtains finally closin'
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey All I've got, all I've got
I'mma let it be fire
Time to giddy up
Need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Tonight, all night, I'mma roll
To know that I am happy with some other guy
Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum Faded pictures on the wall
You light my fire
Glass is shattered from the fight
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Don't want to think about it
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
Work work work work work work Ner ner ner ner ner ner!
No there's just one, one, one
Like the way you do this
He don't want it, not like you want it
K-K-K-Killin' these hoes
Or figure this shit out
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You're fading away Saw you turn into a ghost
Why couldn't you be the one? (Why? Why? Why?) All I've got, all I've got
Kiss me like you
I'mma turn your body out
Never, have I ever
So you already know what's next
But they don't know what I found
I drink to that.
You're gonna be in the emergency room
In central station
Better go on, girl
Want you to make me feel
Of a girl with a broken heart
I'm like how could it be? It should have been me and you
The drum, that's my heart beat
So that I can't stay mad at you
And I still got my money
I just really need your ass with me
And hold on if you're losing your way
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I spilled all my emotions tonight I'm sorry
I need you now
Oh tell me what you're willing to do? (Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Flat line on the EKG well, I was home late at night watching TV
There ain't nothing here for me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the

With violent words and empty threats
But they make me wanna melt they face away

Unhappy with the riches

No more, I don't even really care about you no more (woo woo)
What you would do if I
Really loves my company He's more than a man
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up It goes one by one even two by two
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
And I know that it's hard to digest
Take a minute, you know inside you feel it right
I don't wanna be alone Dear desperado
Killin' these niggas [Verse 2: Rihanna]
When you walked out of my life
Shots, shots, shots, shots
