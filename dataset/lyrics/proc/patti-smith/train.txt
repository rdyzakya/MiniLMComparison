I recall the wonder of it all
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
Awake
The waving of hands
Cause I was down in Georgia
Toward another
And sky to sky
By the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed 
It's real nice to talk to you, I didn't
Comin' through my door
Come back come back come back
I would measure the success of a night 
Yeah, well, I'll be seein' ya, goodbye, bye
And so he seized the first
knowing no ending to our rendezvous
On this night I know
I don't want no handout;
Because tonight there are two lovers ...
Isabella, all is knowing.
Show your papers, boy.
And walls I've caressed. 
This is my jack-knife. This is my jack." (shriek)
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
But my dream it lingered near
What you pay for these riches and fame
I will give to you
He opened his throat (your eyes)
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
But I'm with you
No one to bow to, to vow to, to blame.
Dust of scenes
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
Are you ready to behave?
spirit moaned
We waltzed beneath motionless skies
World ending, it's just beginning
And I got this crazy feeling that I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
and said come on eat
I'll lie awake
I know soon still that platinum is coming
Holy the unknown buggered and suffering beggars
Oh a little insane
Down by the ocean it was so dismal.
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
They sat there they sat there watching the sun
And oh, she was so good and oh, she was so fine
Oh, I'm pissing in a river.
the endless seed of mystery,
Desire to dance;
thy breath thy spear
salute our love
Lightning as armor and it's today
So darling farewell
Aww clean clean it out
We like birdland.
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
He restoreth my soul.
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.
She won't need it any more (babble)
I thought you were some perfect read-out
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.
The air we breathe
I, I was watching you for, actually, I've watched you for a long time
In light rapidly changing
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
That banana-shaped object ain't no banana.
Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift.
He comes to comfort me
We are the tears that fall from your eyes,
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Baby get it there, baby tag it,
Holy the sea, holy the desert, holy the railroad
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack.
And we never got lucky
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Well, I move in another dimension
Wave thou are white
the thorn, the veil, the face of grace,
Don't hesitate now
I never wanted to see the sun again
Come on. Set me free.
And I know it got you reelin'
one long ecstatic pure sensation
Baby got it and baby begged for it, baby
Set me free.
go down to the sea
I walk alone
I could see the sights
And he does not sing a thing mournful
And they come and they call and they crawl on the floor.
I'm floating in a door backward
Lady liberty, lend a hand to me, I've been cast adrift.
He stayed behind the assembly hall,
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
What is it, Father, that shapes from your hand?
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong
I needed nobody
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Because the night belongs to lust
Gone this maze of being skin
Toward a dream
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
It's wild wild wild wild
You're a rock & roll star
to the simple
We got to fly over the land, over the sea.
(baby worship something)
And my baby is walkin' through the door
Listen, I believe everythin' we dream
Leave me something to live.
I feel a needing
gone to where the feather flies
alive I awoke
Oh you'll ride
It started hardening
And you were reflected
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.
But now my hair itself is a veil, 
Oh, to cry not any cry
In 1959
We can turn the world around
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card
and in his heart a yearning yet
They never dreamed
no, not sympathy.
the ashes rain
Legions of light, virtuous flight. Ignite, excite.
whirl away
On that day
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Forgive, the yearning burning
Let's soar
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Little blue shoes that walk across the sky
Do you go to the temple tonight?
Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream
The hand above
You say you wish for me.
till we can rest
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
With doubt the vicious circle
Rock & roll
don't have the will to go on.
Our wild love came from above
There were twenty thousand girls called their names out to me
Well, I move in another direction,
Dream of your brother.
he appreciates Brancusi's [?] space
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
And the planets will shift,
Holy the supernatural, extra brilliant, intelligent, kindness of the soul
the sea's the possibility
Break it, break it, break it, break it
To breathe an air
Should I go the length of a river,
come on darling eat
What could I do
all the days of my life.
grateful heart grateful limbs
We left behind on the road
Where there were deserts, I saw fountains
Well you're a little insane
Space monkey, sort of divine-vine
I saw and no one seemed to mind
And dismal street
Every move I made I move to you,
it was beautiful
It was there he made his bed,
like a voice that knows it's gone
Ahh the equation
I want another, baby.
It's gonna be all right
Nobody gets nothing
oh he would shift he would not shift at all
She is concentrating on
and move on
Really it was really wonderful, I really felt happy, It really made me happy
the sense of you surrounds
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
a burning stem
And the people that confronted him were many.
You used to fly me the way to speed.
I am calling
Oh, into the center of my brain, and baby come, baby go
Blood and light runnin'. It's all like a dream.
Don't say nothing
I walked the floor then I looked away
All of the power
I was
Holy the fifth International, holy the Angel in Moloch
where the tolling suspends
Of happiness
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
and they rattled their tales hissin'
In 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959, 1959
Dream of Life
So mournful that the dove just laughs the steadfast gasps
was all that I pursued
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.
And free the hurricane, oh, I go into the center of the airplane
About a boy
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
He spared the child and spoiled the rod. 
And whirl on a pane of glass
grateful soul he's gone again
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer
And there's more
Wild card up my sleeve
What about it, I can't live without you,
Ahh the borders of heaven
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
we lay down into the wind
Break it up, break it on up, up, up
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
but none but sky
Oh, don't you know that anyone can join
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
Break it up, don't look at me."
One of vanity
Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes
So please stand back now and let time tell you.
Hope streaking the canvas sky
Total abandon
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway
Positive (anarchy must exist.)
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
And it's wild wild wild wild.
Speak to me shadow
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
We shall live again, we shall live.
Weaving tho the eyes are pale, what will rend will also mend.
People rising from the highway
Building scenes on empty dreams
The wall. The wall.
But I look up
From the Portobello Road
Is entwined
What's your name, son?
some born to dancers
With a green vapor, made her feet light
Their eyes for his eyes
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,
Free money, free money, free money, free money, free money, free money.
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.
They can't touch you now,
That makes me feel just what I need.
And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
Please, oh oh won't you return?
the children will rise
And he saw raven comin' in
blessed is the grass
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
All my earthly dreams are shattered,
we'll bare our arms as wings
Oh, the dice roll so deceptively
Dead to the world my body was sleeping
like arteries, like fingers
And I can gaze deep
Total abandon, ooh wah
All my dresses you made by hand
oh-wo-wo ...
thy season of mirth
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast
Rejoin to me as
(on the screen)
Pray for your brother.
We joined the long caravan
From the field
Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off 
A stranger comes up to him; hands him an old, rusty Polaroid.
Oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
An afixiation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree
you'd be a wing
passively stationed
Everything I've done, I've done for you
You must turn around (and look oh God)
I had an ornamental veil, but I couldn't bear to use it. 
and slips our binding rings
I spin, I spiral, and I splatter
Guardian angels/up above
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star,
Everything is holy, everybody's holy, everywhere is holy
Seeking love without exception
Baby got big and baby get bigger.
Can come to pass through our union
Like Shakespeare's child
its stream
Well listen now to what I say
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring
some material thing
death's own bed
Oh, to be not anyone
Little blue boy you're on your own
didn't have nowhere
Na na na na na
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
All the lacy lights
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,
Beyond his own
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
What you get is the public acclaim
And to re-create from excretion of man pure and then soft and then solid gold.
cause your love flows
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
You said when you were with me that nothing made you high.
When I want somethin' I want more,
And white opals swimming
The skin is holy, the nose is holy
And in a week or two if you make the charts
I'll be a ranger
To take His hand, His sacred heart
From the meek the graces shower
from the lofty heights
and then we will arise
In a light to last a whole life through
But it's decreed the people rule
He says, "Oh man, I don't get the picture. This is no picture.
Women all standing with shock on their faces.
waiting underground
Many is the time I knelt in the light
It serves man
I was so forsaken
Oh no, I don't believe so, no
The mourning veil is waving high a field of stars and tears we've shed.
Heard it on the radio Won't be no need for layin' in the road
five steps
We can hold on (I'm sure)
Nodding tho the lamp's lit low, nod for passers underground.
And these viral times
Easter Sunday, we were talking.
In the land of Shangri-La
It was ladened with all kinds of shit
Whose bone scraped, whose flesh unfurled
Shall we divide and become another
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face
Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling,
You know she got big. Well, she's gonna get bigger.
Here a man man's own kin
Slid in that thing and it grew wings
of we three?
If you believe all your hope is gone
There's a little place, a place called space
Oh, in your starry eyes, baby,
Because the night belongs to lovers
you can hold on the blade and turn around forever
We do not eat
A sleeping Marine
and I was free
The abstract streets
The heart that breaks the dawn, Amen
Holy the clocks in space, holy the fourth dimension
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it
Everlasting, ever new
I spin from the wheel
Flung from paradise
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Souls are invaded, heart in a groove.
The sexual streets, why it's all so insane.
Sun is rising on the water
Why must not death be redefined?
What about it, you don't need me,
Mouth of a cave, I'm a slave I'm free.
To redeem the work of fools
Space monkey, sort of divine.
Oh, can't you see that time is the key that will unlock the destiny
There will be silence
Holy Tangiers, holy Moscow, holy Istanbul
that I may find love true
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Not here but here
Baby get something. Baby get more.
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up ,up, up ...
Men in uniform gave me vinegar, spoon of misery.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
to twist in my hand
and when it rains
Oh I am waiting for you,
So I'm free to move in the resurrection.
They were rioting in Chicago, movement in L.A.
No one heard that cry,
assaulted it seems
When questioned who had sent for him,
And he was told but these few words,
In the heart of the ancient
in every step I take
Holy ours, bodies suffering magnanimity
I didn't hear them I didn't see
love spewed from the heart of me.
Filled with grace
In a room somewhere
Living in steps
I was lost, and the cost,
My heart Oh
we raise our arms to him on night
sow their seed into the wind
Who walked the curve of the world
She is addicted to thee
Let's go under
Baby wants somethin', I want more
Which opened up his heart,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
Turn and burns
Oh my brain I got to complain
The hairs were like wires going through my body
Because the people had their ear
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Tattoo fingers shy away from me
(I want more)
and himself as well
I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,
we bless our spoils and we're gone we're gone
Light of my life, he's dressed in flame.
[in background:]
where I have yet to roam
the clouds pressed with hand prints stained
Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers
Holy Peter, holy Allen, holy Solomon, holy Lucien
The number of my moves
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so.
He answered with his thumb,
(they knew what they were after)
dead to the world alive I awoke
(babble)
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn.
slumbering land that just begins
In the wheel and wing
Well I'm gonna do something
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Help!
and your humankind becomes as one
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something
Let's go under where the sun beams
warrior cried
He, who is chosen by she
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,
in foreign alphabet
Hoverin' liquid, move over moon for my
Who is due for gift upon gift
Because the night belongs to us
(I wanna score)
It's for everyone
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
And then they laid her on the table
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
till I a raven be
Stoned in space. zeus. christ. it has always been rock and so it is and so it shall be.
We are here, we attend
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
beyond us it will fall
why must we guard anything at all
His father died and left him a little farm in New England.
oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
every time I see [?]
One foot extended, snake to the ground,
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
People say "beware!"
no future at all
appealing to all that I know
Oh, the path leads to the sun. Brother, sister, time has come.
Wake from thy sleep
Every night before I go to sleep
Is it heaven
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff.
From the foam
Down, down, poppy, yeah
In my glove
ummm what a treat
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Needed you, you withdrew
Looking at the shiny red tractor
And each day you'll grow
I haven't fucked much with the past, 
and we'll slide down
With a throat smooth as a lamb
She is benediction
some giveth their land
My dove
he was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke
Cut the chord. Overboard. Just a refugee.
I, I, well I'm just clumsy, yeah, no, it's just a band-aid, no, it's okay
Hey now man's own kin
and then all will be fine
There is no keeper but the key
Nothing to fear
That I'll never end transcend transcend
We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly, 
seize the sky and they're gone again
Oh, to owe not anyone
The narrow archway; the layers; 
The voice is holy, the hearers are holy, the ecstasy is holy
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
Out of the shadows
And check out the planets there and then take you down
how vagrant hearts relent prevail
Or would you confuse
Gripping my senses
And the boy was just standing there alone
come a mist an aire so appealing
Is it any wonder crying in the sun
the sky just opens
See when they offer me book of gold,
Rude up thy bird, tayi, tayi.
they spread themselves before me
[?]
I was listening they were saying this and saying that
They're singing, "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine."
Rise up hold the reins
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back
We waltzed beneath God's point of view
There will be no famine in my existence
A glow we will all know
Cast adrift from the citizen ship, 
Take arms. Take aim. Be without shame
As long as you're safe, Kimberly.
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
Holy the miracles, holy the eyeball, holy the abyss
Each way I turn
Citizen ship we got mem'ries.
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby,
To say hello.
Oh, into the center of my brain and baby come, baby go
Will be here just here
oh there are places I agree
Here she comes
Across the country through the fields
In the towers of gold
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
No savior jailer can take it from me
I heard me a music that drew me to dancing
Igniting like every form of light
[?] if he would just tell me
Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge
Holy the cocks of the grandfathers of Kansas
space monkey. Sign of the time-time.
Lama was a young man
I was looking for you
Let's go under my friend
Your soul was like a network of spittle,
for the sake of their coat
grateful arms grateful limbs
Who walked through the callow mist
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
Come come come come come come
oh-oh
Space monkey, so outta line-line.
I stood among them
alive alive I awoke
And let it deep in
Oh I am waiting for you, oh I am waiting for you,
Up, up to the belly of a ship.
Softly go
that's how I
Gone gone, gone gone, good-bye.
and he arose his blood aflame
Up there
And oh. you were so good, oh, you were so fine
And I whirl, and I whirl,
Give me something.
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,
Not to hail a barren sky. Sifting cloth is weeping red.
They know not what they do
more lives than a cat
In a ring
Dressed in scraps
[Refrain]
(three steps...)
also makes fertile
And I want rockin' real slow I wanna hear it on the radio
(Holy the bop)
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream.
Eat anything at all.
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
The madman is holy as you my soul are holy
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,
Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow
In the end the end
in another eye
every other tear
You say you pray for me.
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing
And I felt the arrows of desire
grateful heart he's gone again
We buried him by the river
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm with you always
He sang, "Break it up, oh, I don't understand.
When I am troubled in the night
And he turned and heard me say so desp'rately,
eat eat eat
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And refuse a hand to me
I'm waiting for a contact to call.
Oh look at me aah
and I pushed away my plate
that went streaming through the sands like fingers,
Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Have you seen death swimming
I desire him, and he is absolutely ready to seize me. 
The transformation of waste is perhaps the oldest pre-occupation of man. man being the chosen alloy,
Well it's all a vicious game
With a skirt of green net sewed over 
Threw out your shoe over the soil,
The world is restless
I am the sword, the wound, the stain.
Oh, and my senses newly opened
He'll be there too
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,
Come on. Come and love me.
Isabella, we are rising.
And my fingers all entwined through the air,
I'm here a whispering you summouned I called
On the hill, hear us call through a realm of sound.
but I was free
I gave you a wristwatch, baby
Inherent with(in) us is the dream of the task of the alchemist to create from the clay of man.
Toward a river
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
help thinking that smile
Along the black river
God or the law
With a mind that multiplied
round the bend
And take some time and learn how to play
He has gone
It starts crumbling in his hands.
Oh, Albino
in our snow-white shrouds
I-I walk in a room, you know I look so proud
Well I was dreamin' in my dreamin'
Wave thou are music
Because the night belongs to lovers ...
Deep inside of your ship
Just for work just to get a job
And he put up his hands and he said, “It's me, it's me,
riding on a copper wave.
There is no land but the land
Wave thou art pretty
Humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter
Looking for you
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic,
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity.
Child of Iran
To and fro she's darning, and the land is weeping red and pale.
I was lost, and the cost
She was, she was completely still.
Got no recollection of my past reflection,
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop.
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
Too startled to try.
and I opened up my veins to them
to illume thy night
Everyone, silver ecstatic, platinum disk spinning
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
You got a piece and hit across the sky
Say you dream of me.
Come move in another dimension oh oh oh
A saint in any form.
Voices voices beckoning sea
In the sheets
What about it? What about it?
and our children are being blown away like wishes in the wind
As I declare to you
cause darling you died
A crazy and sleepy Comanche 
Nothing good was coming I just stood there
Isabella, we are dying.
'til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light.
Feel so fucked up
and when he was gone I was gone on a smile
Take them up up up up up up
oh I whispered will you ever return
They can prophet understanding
And world war is the battle cry
What is it, Father, are you into shape
I'm so tired I quit
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
Where wishes fall
Hungry dreaming going west
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,
Melt down in the sun
We'll be gone but they'll go on and on and on and on and on.
like an ancient claim
on my mind was nothing at all
Space monkey, so out of line and it's all just space, just space.
Sea returns to sea
The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
Let's close our eyes and call the deep
Here I am.
the flesh was lean
Who will decide
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
all the gifts that God had gave
Holy the hideous human angels
'cause the thing that you gain
In the presence of my enemies,
Stretch out your arms now tip and swing,
As I lay down into my sleepin'
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
needed nobody
And I go to this here party and I just get bored
Hey, Lord, I'm waitin' for you.
I take that money, buy you things you never had.
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.
the need to weave
and he's gone again
Lead me, oh, lead me.
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel." 
Do you like the world around you?
It's all gonna split his skull
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
soared over the ocean
the American zone
Crack it open
When are you coming ? Hope you come soon
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
I don't think (after station) there's any station
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Space monkey, sort of divine-vine.
hello friend [X4]
But we were looking fine
There is no sea but the sea
Parallel prayers
But when I was waving to you, the way your face was, it was so
This is my jack-knife. This is my jack-knife.
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
And I know soon that the sky will split
And I came like a magnet for you now.
We don't give a shit.
On the radio, heard it on the radio
It's no mystery
Thieves, poets we're inside out
Oh people of Ethiopia
Thick heart of stone
The winds ablaze
Hand of God, and I start to whirl
They belong to me, me
Little blue path where those feet fall
Hey Sheba, hey Salome, hey Venus eclipsin' my way ah.
Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Some strange music draws me in
Hear it on the radio, goddamn in my radio,
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
Oh, God, I'm waitin' for you;
We can turn the earth's revolution
No [?], don't leave me no space in your little boat
Time for communion
And I, I just wanted to thank you, because, you, you really, really
Oh, look around you, all around you,
Nothing to be
There will be trumpets
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
[?] cannot move ahh so much aahh everything I am
will cross again
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,
Blood on the T.V., ten o'clock news.
With a strange way of walking
You know I see it written 'cross the sky
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,
In the straw-colored light
Let my eyes rise in the sky looking for you
The earth we grind
We'll surface
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh.
And we strolled there together
Ain't got my real name.
And like Shakespeare's child
Of an aspect bright and fair
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.
And oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
I'm going up, I'm going up
(laughin' at the flowers)
I could exude over the columns that nestled the P.A. 
There is no leopard and the lamb
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
I wished on them all
Deep in my heart
Served it up with love
He's delighted to love me, but you know,
I been walking
I turned my back walked away
Little blue star that offers light
The tiniest train
(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)

Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance
And May ribbons streaming

All communion is not holy
I move in another dimension
Cats like us are obsolete
If we dream, dream, dream for free.
You wouldn't even give me the time of day
In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true.

There's no burning where the sun beams
Don't avert your eyes
Sweet revenge

Oh, oh-oh. Down and down.
And you were standing there, waving at everybody
Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
Hi, hi, I was running after you for a long time

Are the perfect thing for your system
How the presence of you shines
In the soul of the desert

Where the pure air recognized
I was feeling sensations in no dictionary

To recall what I had found
Paths that cross

When life is new
Where God's get lost
And the borders of heaven
The nature of my blues
Hope dashed immortal hope

Blind alley in New York City, in a foreign embrace.
I fell so ceaselessly
Oh, watch them say you're too high
That he had
all in all he captured my heart
and the corn still grows
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
Isabella, we are rising . . .
What more can I give you? Baby I don't know
and the cost didn't matter to me.
the coming and dying of the moon
until I can rest
Caught in the crest
And the sky split and the planets hit,
dancing around
nigger, nigger, nigger.
My head is aching as I drink and breathe
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue
In a single
Oh sleeping sun
Heading for a spill.
was written before us
two steps
Over the skin of silk are scars 
we sat for a while he was very engaging
it on the radio Baby got it but baby want more
Dust off the words that shaped from the tale.
can but do for you
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing
and they saw nothing
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
And I know it's hard sometimes,
all heaven's glory turned in your eyes
there was a man
Does the sea dream (I'm sure)
You are living on my time, my dear
Erase and blend
Honey, well, we were lookin' fine
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight
From the bright storm
Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Holy Peoria and Seattle, holy Paris
Stateless, they got shame.
Baby wants somethin', she's in the mood to
(His fingers)
If we believe in the night we trust
What is it, Father, that is waiting in Heaven?
'til I lose my sense of gravity...
Sometimes my spirit's empty;
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Again I am the salt, the bitter laugh.
Wave
Do you not go to the palace of answers with me Marie?
The lights were violet and white. 
I'm waiting above in the sky, dear
the staff of life all around you
And the cause is you lookin' up at me.
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Where the wild goats play
And he's mine, mine, all mine.
From the vast portals
Let's do some celebrating
Hi hello
First take my hand now let it go
but until that day we will just await
And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
Wave up the Earth, one turn around.
Ali smiles
Backwards and forwards
Blood life streaming cross my hand
It's all elemental
The typewriter is holy, the poem is holy
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
Holy New York, holy San Francisco
My heart pumping, my heart pumping, my heart pumping
To waste in the dust
Holy the locomotive, holy the visions, holy the hallucination
Your opiate is the air that you breathe
Who will perceive
Oh no, I'm always doing something's always happening to me
it rains on me
My bowels are empty, excreting your soul
Free money, free money, free money, [X7]
cause time will bid and make us rise
Twenty-five stories over Detroit,
Holy my mother in the insane asylum
Why must we pray screaming?
I don't get nervous
Love is a ring, the telephone
Crawlin' up my stair
And when I look inside of your temple
If you're hungry you're not too particular about what you'll taste.
On the twenty-fifth floor.
Lord, I do extol Thee, for Thou has lifted me.
To the sea's foaming mane
Food from the father, tayi, taye aye.
Raging sweet
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,
Suc-cess city
into the glare of all out little wars
(up there)
The sifting cloth is binding, and the dream she weaves will never end.
Hand of God, I feel the finger,
In a child's leather purse
a warrior died
With time you go downtown
Come on honey
And the shepherds [?] the soldiers
I was lost, and measure for measure,
