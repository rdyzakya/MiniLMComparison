I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
So take it down Go all the way
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
Don't you tell 'em Boy you say you down wit it
You're not unique in dying
Play along
They were friends of mine Don't hang around as the promise breaks
I want the applause the approval the things that make me go Oh, oh, oh, oh
Watch all those late shows on TV...
That kind of lux just ain't for us
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
It drives you crazy, getting old We can talk it so good
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Not in the swing of things yet I'm not in the swing of things
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known
At the swingin' party down the line No one knows where the ladder goes
You don't even gotta tell 'em
But it's so easy in this blue, where everything is good And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
I get caught up, just for a minute
He don't wanna know me
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
For the love club Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
I let the seasons change my mind
Bobby Brown wit it
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It feels better biting down [Verse 1:]
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) I'm in a clique but I want out
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see
I do my best to meet her demands
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
It feels better biting down It feels better biting down
The drink you spilt all over me
Eating me alive until you're gone
Except to be alone Be a part of the love club
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
And the stories brand new
Lights from the jungle till dusk sky
We told you this was melodrama We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day yeah
Get you wild, make you leave
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Lick my lips toss my hair
I wanna fly in your silver ship, but
Never not chasing a million things I want
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go
Says it was poison
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
Look out, lovers We're L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
I'm acting like I don't see every
And then they are bored of me
Feeling alone
These are the games of the weekend
In the old days there was enough
Go astray with me? King and Queen of the weekend
We aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
Help me make the most Of freedom and of pleasure
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
But who am I?
These are what they call hard feelings of love
It feels better biting down Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
Lonely on the new shit Set yeah
Cleaning up the champagne glasses We told you this was melodrama
Supercut of us Cause in my head, in my head, I do everything right
White teeth teens are out
So there [Chorus]
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone,
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
I know you're feeling it too
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
Everybody wants to rule the world It's my own design
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
And everyone's competing
Its on now, the days are long now
Every night I go sneaking out the door.
There's no turning back
We pretend that we just don't care
Pulses can drive from here
And you can watch from your window Baby be the class clown
(Can you feel it, can you, can you)
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
We didn't come from money But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Be your violent overnight rush
At the swingin' party down the line
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
This whole life of hallucination
Send the call out Call all the ladies out
At the swingin' party down the line Pound the prairie pavement
It was real for me, yup, real for me
And I'm in love with being queen ooh ooh oh ooh
They try to tell us all that we will lose
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
We order different drinks at the same bars
I'm speeding up and this is the
It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough?
Nobody take me out tho
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Then I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime
And I've never felt more alone
My mother's love is choking me
But you're not in love no more
And I'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do A rush at the beginning
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah "What is this tape?"
One day we're all get still
See now the stars burst
Keeps me up a level
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
Every perfect summer's
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
I fall apart, with all my heart
And the girls get their claws out
Life is great without a care
Let me live that fantasy Welcome to your life
The visions never stop
Moved 'round our heads I want them back
It's just another graceless night, 'cause All of the things we're taking
Our only wish was melodrama
Gold teeth
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
All the love we had and lost
When you call I'll forgive and not fight
We can make it so divine
It's just another graceless night
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart In my head, I do everything right
Loving and grabbing the rhythm of the hips
And boy, I promise
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
I wear the robe like no one could And everything works out so good
If I gotta go first
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
Limelight, lose my mind
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means (Oh! Oh!)
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Bruising sidewalks
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
I turn all of it
Generation Bet you wanna rip my heart out
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
But what will we do when we're sober? Midnight, we're fading
But I think that you might be the same as me
Everybody wants to rule the world There's a room where the light won't find you
It's my own remorse
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
They're in their finery
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
All the glamour and the trauma
You're a liability
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're gonna lose what you love the most
Take the pill make it too ill
When you're a member go on your great adventure again
Impress the empress, take a shot now We got the glow in our mouths
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat Wait 'til you're announced
We're all alone
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
Ooh (hey)
The ups and the sun down
Here it's never ending
"This is my favorite tape" Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Trashing the hotel room We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams But everybody's like:
It feels so scary, getting old I want them back
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
Crystal
But I know it's not forever (yeah) Baby be the class clown
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
We can talk it good
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
But that will never be enough
I'll do it on my terms
Body like the summer, Oh you like no other
Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses) And the terror and the horror
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
And make 'em all dance to it
So take it down
Trying to find these perfect places
Let's go to perfect places All the nights spent off our faces
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark)
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
Don't you tell 'em Uh oh, Uh oh
Oh You asked if I was feeling it
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
White teeth teens are Up for it
The hounds will stay in chains
Girl you know you're from Chicago, he like the full
I know it's dumb We've both got a million bad habits to kick
We've not yet lost all our graces
We're alone All the double-edged people and schemes
It's nearly perfect. What would my mamma do?
When people are talking, people are talking
When you dream with the fever
They're studying business, I study the floor
All the moments I play in the dark
Gotta wonder why we bother, ooh oh
But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
We will find you Acting on your best behaviour
But what will we do when we're sober?
me a reason I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
It's buzz cut season anyway
They lose their minds for us, and how it plays out (ha)
Stroking her cheek They say, "You're a little much for me
It feels so scary, getting old We can talk it so good
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
Glory and gore go hand in hand
Into continents and cars
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
Can you hear the violence?
We're sleeping through all the days
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) It looked alright in the pictures (yeah) Getting caught soft with the triple is it
Is one girl swaying alone
Pull out your heart to make the
With all the drumming of our feet
There's somethin' 'bout the night,
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
But it's so easy in this blue
(You buy me orange juice)
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
E-a-na-na-na, everyone They're gonna watch me
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Where all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
Don't know you super well
A hundred jewels between teeth
Waiting for you to get well
But you keep the car on
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Rest of you fools
And the terror and the horror
But we know that, when it's over
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak
We hang side by side
While he glows through the room Dancing around the lies we tell
When they get dark But my hips have missed your hips
Never made me lose it
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw
Better on my own They say, "You're a little much for me
Sorry I was never good like you
That's right, right, right, right, right Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Jet planes
Let me live that fantasy My friends and I we've cracked the code
I remember when your head caught flame
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
Disappear into the sun
Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Why should I feel ashamed?
When they do I'll be right behind you So glad we've almost made it
Easy, oh easy
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size I was frightened of every little thing
We count our dollars on the train to the party
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know
Diamonds on your timepiece
I'm a little much for
We come around here all the time
Oh I guess that must be you
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
You don't even
We know that it's over
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Or maybe people are jerks When people are talking, people are talking (But not you)
Brand new sounds in my mind
And the heating comes on
They'll talk about us, and discover
I feel a strange every now and then
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you (And I like you)
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
B-bodies all through my house
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name?
I'll find a way to be without you, babe In my head, I play a supercut of us
No post code envy But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
And in my head
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? (Go back and tell it) Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
Everything will glow for you
Fill my dashboard just the same We got the glow in our mouths
But we care (but what will we do when we're sober?)
And you know we're on each other's team I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
Where everything is good [Post-Chorus:]
In the torn up town, no post code envy But every song's like:
Got flowers for all my rooms
Hey, promise I can stay good
Around this liquor, wet
I ride the subway, read the signs
Turn your back on mother nature
When people are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
Water all around,
While you're waiting out front You pick me up and take me home again
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Every night, I live and die
Being alone
Alone with the hard feelings of love
He's on that girl he's talking laps
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
We're getting dead and it's the right way Go all the way
Keep on pulling that rope will break We'll welcome the new age
Now bring my boys in
Maybe the Internet raised us
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you 'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Help me to decide
What would my daddy say?
Oh, oh, oh, oh It's a switch flipped
Supercut of us
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Some imagine freedom
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
But I live in a hologram with you Cola with the burnt-out taste
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free Be a part of the love club
It's not about just being out with all our people
Did it frighten you
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood (Oh! Oh!)
How all the thoughts
But I live in a hologram with you [Bridge:]
Make you crazy over my touch But it's just a supercut of us
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting A rush at the beginning
It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound
Than only nine lives
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
How we kissed and killed each other, ooh oh
Let's go to perfect places Every night, I live and die
Sparking up my heart
Played it so nonchalant
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays) [Chorus 2:]
Complain about work
Not in the swing of things yet All work and no play
We make a picture perfect team
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
When I speak my mind
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
And everyone who knows us knows
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
Bruising the sun, I feel grown up with you in your car
Don't you tell 'em Dely fool, fool wit it
Even the comatose
Maybach
And the fucking melodrama, ooh oh
Send the call out
Hands under your t-shirt
And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short lived
I can tell that you're tired
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
We'll never ever let you leave
I'm biting my tongue When people are talking, people are talking
But I can take it from here
And the way it hides all the things I like.
All the nights spent off our faces
You're not alone in anything
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
All work and no play
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
Down the back, but who cares, still the Louvre Okay I know that you are not my type (still I fall)
This will not do Oh, oh, oh, oh
Guess this is the winter
Now you're feeling up when I press play
Where all the things that we do for fun
And send a smile over
And I like you
How you wish it would be all the time The drink you spilt all over me
Flying with nowhere to be
And everything works out so good
So they pull back, make other plans
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
(Ooh ooh oh)
You and me
It's not the same as when I was punched
E-a-na-na-na, everyone The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
Now I can't stand to be alone
But I know you know what to do wit it
There are fights for being my best friend
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
As if you got to pull wit it (Ahh...)
There'll be plenty enough room in jail If being wrong's a crime
And I'll never go home again
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
So please don't go out
Never let you leave Easy, easy
I've been fighting a war
I'll let me be down wit
The men up on the news
I wear the robe like no one could (White teeth teens are out)
But if you're with my best friends
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
Bloodstains
I understand, I'm a liability
The real fun was when we were young
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
But victory's contagious I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
"Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
Tigers on a gold leash We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
Well I guess I should go
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you All those rumors, they have big teeth
But secretly they're saviors
Don't tell 'em
We're on each other's team
(Make believe, it's hyper-real)
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Let's go back It feels better biting down
All of our heroes fading
So sad they had to fade it
Will you sway with me?
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Let me count the bruises
To stop this (And everything works out so good)
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
And I like you (One, two) Baby really hurt me
But what will we do when we're sober? Oh God, I'm closing my teeth
When people are talking, people are talking Let 'em talk We're never done with killing time
We'll end up painted on the road
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick
Pass around the lampshade
How we kissed and killed each other
It feels so scary, getting old
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm little, but I'm coming for you (chase paper, get it)
Tie the knots to concentrate
I'm little but I'm coming for the title, held by everyone who's up All work and no play
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
All the stages and the stars
Their skin in craters like the moon
You can call me queen bee
You let yourself down
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Shards beneath our feet
We're all alone When people are talking, people are talking
Oh, dancing with us, oh, you'll be dancing with us
Know I think you're awesome, right? Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
A hundred jewels on throats
So there
We aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It's time we danced with the truth
It's alright if you do, it's fine
Can't remember when it started
Let me live that fantasy ooh ooh oh ooh
Disappear into the sun Every night, I live and die
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
I see you with all of your front teeth
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
Fall asleep reading science fiction
Play at romance, we slow dance
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
My momma hang and my sister, sit
And everywhere we go I can feel the subtle taste
Ooh why, why, why, why, why
I'd like it if you stayed Now we're wearing long sleeves
Favorite friend
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter
The only problem that I got with the club
Just keep it up with one J Only wit you got it feel like this
But when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
Ah ah (hey)
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Even while we sleep
It's not enough to feel the lack
Ball gowns
I know that it's exciting
You switch the screens over the
Get still When people are talking, people are talking
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
For the love club I joined the club and it's all on
Baby I'm a helpless.
Running through the night, but
You're allergic but you never said
Like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
I'm someone you maybe might love
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
They lose their minds for us and how it plays out (ha oh)
And never going fishing
And you can watch from your window
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
We're getting good at this
I'd like it if you stayed We're never done with killing time
When you get to my (limelight, lose my mind) A couple rebel top gun pilots
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
And roll out your maps and papers
You're a little much for me"
Don't tell em how you hit the ground wit it
It feels better biting down The electronics of your heart
There'll never be enough of us Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
It's not only you
We told you this was melodrama Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
She know about me and you?
All the rest is predictable
Here it's never ending,
We might be hollow, but we're brave (And I like you)
You're looking dead behind the eyes We'll stay at your house
I won't be her, tripping over on stage
Cola with the burnt-out taste
And if I like it then we'll stay
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
And do nothing and love it And everything works out so good
Generation (look out, lovers) L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S
Limelight
A limit in spite
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire
To trip me up and laugh at me But I learnt not to want
Send us to perfect places
When we wonder why we bother, ooh oh
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
All business all day
I like it best when you're in here with me And all the lost boys
There'll never be enough of us [Chorus 1:]
Don't you tell 'em what we do Don't tell 'em
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
To stop this If you want we'll help tonight to split his schemes
Disappear into the sun Limelight
I tried to join but never did
I see you happy in the front seat
People should see how we're living
We told you this was melodrama
Throw the lunch you pay for
And you know we're on each other's team
But in all chaos, there is calculation
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean And the cry goes out (ha)
Where everything is good [Post-Chorus]
But she's a forest fire
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
Everything I say falls right back into everything I'm not in the swing of things
Quitting school and going to work
'Til the veins run red and blue
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
And the holy sick divine nights, ooh oh
Explosions on TV
Get through the days
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
So now we live beside the pool
I am not a white teeth teen
But victory's contagious Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
But that will never be enough All my life
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
If they keep tellin' me where to go
For a love they won't receive
Let me live that fantasy I do my makeup in somebody else's car
But when we're dancing I'm alright
Oh easy, easy Easy, easy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
This dream isn't feeling sweet
The other day I forgot my old address
Yeah, awesome right?
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain,
Doesn't happen quite as bad as the burn is just skin
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
We're alone All my fake friends and all of their noise
Sharing beds like little kids
Oh, they bite you
The waves come after midnight
I'm the one you tell your fears to
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money But every song's like:
Don't you tell 'em Only wit you got it feel like this
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this It's in your blood stream
Why even try to get right?
Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
The minds we had
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
The moon we love like a brother
Easy, easy Easy, easy
She's so hard to please
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
But I live in a hologram with you It's time to let the lost boys take you in It's getting cold out
See how fast they fall apart
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay) [Chorus 1:]
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
And running with the kids in the park park park park
Ribbon you used to tie yourself to me But my hips have missed your hips
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Easy I do my makeup in somebody else's car
I know this story by heart
'Cause what this palace wants is release [Chorus]
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
There's nothing that hurts like letting you go
My mum and dad let me stay home
Out of sight when it's
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
You'll get the picture of your dreams
They will be waiting at the end Be a part of the love club
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Don't it just make you wanna cry
I like your reckoning
Generation
And you know we're on each other's team We're on each other's team
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Easy Bring your own lampshade
To be admired to be noticed
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
Everybody wants to rule the world I remember when your head caught flame
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
Did my best to exist just for you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
In my head, I do everything right Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
Give the bruises out like gifts
But I know they'll never own me (yeah) Baby be the class clown
Somewhere there's a party
Lose my mind
And make 'em all dance to it Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
In your car, the radio up
They make a mess then go home and get clean
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
'Till daylight, we're jaded
We rip the start, the colors disappear
Yet here we are again,
Hey, it's all cool
Covered in warrior paint
We're reeling through the midnight streets
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Just give
I can't talk to you or your friends
Limelight Oh god, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
So take it down I'll pull the trick if I want to
Dancing around big eyes as well, ah
If being strong's your kind
Will do the trick trick trick trick We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
Have your fun, have it all
To assault when all eyes are on you
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome I light all the candles
But I live in a hologram with you The drink you spilt all over me
I know you love it when the hairpins started to drop
(Make believe, it's hyper real)
So let's get to know the kicks
Feel the party to my bones
But when I reach for you
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
They don't dance and tell [Chorus]
Find out your hiding places again
In the twisting morn
Tired little laughs, gold lie promises,
I want them back
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Easy, oh easy Oh, easy, easy
All the magic we gave off
Their likeness set in stone Only bad people live to see
We're better than we've every dreamed
What does that make me? I'm not in the swing of things
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
You'll get punched for the love club
To be a good man for someone else
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay) Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh In your car, the radio up
Into the arms of the girl that I love
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you You pick me up and take me home again
And make 'em all dance to it Every night, I live and die
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go There's nothing as fun as coming untied
But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries
And I'm not proud of my address
Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive
I lie a little more,
Let me live that fantasy (Ooh ooh oh)
I love it here since I've stopped needing you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
