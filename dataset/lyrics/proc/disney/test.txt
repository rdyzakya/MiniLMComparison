To this poor provincial town
When you look under the rocks and plants
Mais oui
When the sardine
Movin' on down the line,
Or say that I drift too far
I am everything I've learned and more
But now I'm free
And there you are Chief Tui and Sina:
Ask 'em my questions
Look out for Cruella De Vil At first you think
But still I cannot see
Your as welcome as can be,
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore
no one's gloomy or complaining
Where I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea
Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
He hit the heights at breakneck speed! From zero to hero
Isn't he dreamy
I'll find her, I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris Hellfire, dark fire
Finding you can change
Except within Dies irae, dies illa
Becomes a piece of cake
Baby we're not buying
She's like a spider waiting
So pack up, go home, you're through
needing exercise, a chance to use our skills!
It's Maui, breathe it in
But I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river
(Are you ready?)
Just keep on keepin' on,
That if I were truly to be myself
They'll come to you! Oh man this is really living
How precious life can be And if I never knew you
The circle of life Mmmmmm
You're a bird in a flight
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
I'm on the job you big nabob!
Please, I know you're in there (I know you're in there)
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a
till you shout, enough I'm done
We haven't discussed the subject of payment
With new horizons to pursue
Under the sea The newt play the flute
Sempre é uma surpresa
And my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
(Yeah)
Herc could stop a show
I'm getting closer and closer everyday And I'm almost there
Not yet!
Hmm the inventor's daughter
But the voice inside sings a different song
give me your hand
You've got a brand of magic never fails You've got some power in your corner now!
Up where the air is clear
Know how to jam here
I know its a lot; the hair, the bod
(And we taste the sweet inside)
But the sun rolling high
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now
and bound her in her bones.
And dear lady, please don't laugh
Everywhere you look I'm Standing in spotlight!
Go ahead
If the moon is still awake
The girl who has everything?
Stand tall, just like John.
You'll be here in my heart
Where all your happy dreams come true
It's sad but true
Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped
After all, it's only a beat away from you to me
And the birds will sing
go on, unfold your menu, take a glance then you'll be our guest, oui, our guest, be our guest beef ragout, cheese soufflé
The music play
Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip,
Fry us and eat us
But there's something about her
The heron and the otter are my friends
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go!
Yes I've had the odd complaint
A zero, zero
Full of little people
She brings to those to love
tonight you'll prop your feet up, but for now, let's eat up Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!
Ouch what a terrible performance get the hook
I've come so far
When you're gonna look around
'Morning, Monsieur
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Now I see
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston, You're the greatest
You seem so strong
after all, Miss, this is France
Go on and kiss the girl
(eye to eye!) If you're ever lonely, then stop!
Under the sea
Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
It's the truth, it's "actch'll"
Let it snow, let it snow Salagadoola mechicka boola
All these empty rooms (these empty rooms)
Our favorite flavor! Hercules, Hercules
Their secret longing
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
More to do than can ever be done There's far too much to take in here
I may not be with you
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream
Everybody look left
its fine dining we suggest, be our guest, be our guest, be our guest! life is so unnerving
True that he's no Prince Charming
Good day
The witch who sent this flame
Donald Duck!
Or ride our bikes around the halls
Then maybe try a few The bare necessities of life will come to you
Mind what he says but remember
We use the leaves to build fires
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms
To this
When will my reflection show
A major hunk
Not conceited He was a nothin'
We all must pay a price
What a pro!
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
Your advantage
Part of your world When somebody loved me
Of power and control
In your eyes
It's Mary Poppins, and there we stop! If I never knew you
I swear by my tatoo
Come out the door
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul
And blinking, step into the sun
Good Morning, Belle
Pardon
They always keep her hopping
Stand tall, just like John. Do you wanna build a snowman?
That has possessed me
Look it up
Think of sleigh bells off you go
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis
(The what?)
Out their little hat?
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
There's not a moment to waste A word's just word
(In thought) I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair
When the day is gray and ordianry
I'll have my people to guide me
We use each part of the coconut
The island gives us what we need Moana:
I know a girl from an island
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight
A gentle giant,
Take the path that moonbeams make
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
Workin' for the Canaan Land. Oh, movin' on down the line,
If our time has gone too fast I've lived at last
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
Can learn to be
Manatu atu
To the stars beyond the blue
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Oh, the weather outside is frightful
'Cause let me tell you something little britches
Ways that are winning
Begin the beguine
She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry
The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
You've got a list that's three miles long, no doubt,
They'll come to you! Look for the bare necessities
The chain reaction will never stop
Cogitatione
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Oh, Lord, that battle was beyond compare. John Henry, John Henry,
It won't cost much
Don't walk away
Is exactly the man you always wanted to be
We can make her dress so pretty
Well, who'd have known? Mrs Potts:
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind You can own the Earth and still
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
(Oh, what's in a name?)
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
For the first time eye to eye
And love isn't love
Waking up to say Bonjour
Her flame of love blew out
And you've been so many places
La voce to me Now, sing
I would break my fam'ly's heart Who is that girl I see
Promise not to tell?
Just keep on keepin' on.
Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah (Spoken) Mama, I don't have time for dancing
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Heed my every order and you might survive
And now he's dear and so unsure
What? No longer in the cathedral, she's gone
She don't got a lot to say
Mister, I'll make a man out of you Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
We'll find we're never too far apart
Through faith and love Till we find our place
I walked with you
It's so peculiar,
A most peculiar mademoiselle
I got things I didn't even try
I'll be there for you always
I make everything happen
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there,
Finished already
Gonna help our Cinderelly
When you were waddling yay high
I'll be there from this day on
Under the sea we off the hook
I know you can show them how to do it right. John Henry, John Henry,
We'll show them together 'Cause you'll be in my heart
Oh, let's go fly a kite! When you send it flyin' up there
You know who you are Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Each little slug here
And the nicest guy
You're way off base, I won't say it
She don't say a word
But you'll find that nowadays
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same
There's something sweet and almost kind
What more is you lookin' for? Under the sea
She swapped me for a trout!
We were right If I never knew you
(And to you, Father) Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than
for you our guest, she's our guest,
Now he's a hero Yes indeed! Tale as old as time
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about
The dream that you wish will come true I've been staring at the edge of the water
I wanna walk like you
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Yay Mickey!
When will my reflection show, who I am inside? I know you
Faiga iena
And hold it tight I will protect you
And when I look into your future it's the green that I see On you little man, I don't want wanna waste much time
Larengix glaucitis
Mesmo entre quem
Madame's mistaken There must be more than this provincial life
You can have your own set of wings
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
(Now when I said that, I)
The night will weave its magic spell
And since we've no place to go
Will I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea
I know your name
We'll wait and see
you're alone, and you're scared
But master you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves
There are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o
I know, but
Moana, stay on the ground now
To make me fret
heaven's sakes! is that a spot
There's no moment I regret
Also I lassoed the sun
But she's
The trunks and the leaves
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Beneath the pale moonlight,
We know how you're feeling
That's all right. I'll borrow, this one
How far I'll go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
Okay, bye Elsa?
I think we're seein' it eye to eye
Pode ser seu par Basta um olhar
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
Walking around on those
Born with a hammer right in his hand. John and the drill made the valley shake,
É uma chama acesa Sentimentos vêm
Now, give me the secret, mancub
They come flocking to my cauldron
the sway
You dream about going up there
If you keep on believing
What's beyond that line
If you would woo
No evil thing will
Little town
On the path unwinding
I can't go back
Someone couldn't pay the price
Don't you cry For one so small,
I've started talking to the
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
Here comes a pink cloud for you La la lu, La la lu
Had a face that made you shudder
Who I am
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
Right as a mornin' in May
You're welcome! Well, come to think of it
(The water is sweet inside)
Ten dozen eggs and eight loves of bread. John Henry, John Henry,
Tale as old as time
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
Just look at the world around you
But who cares?
No matter how your heart is grieving
Indescribable feeling
That one wants to get the girl
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O. He was a no one
Or do you still wait for me, dream giver
Look out boys I'm coming through And I'm almost there
but the banquet's all prepared
Unexpectedly. Just a little change
(Take a look inside and see) If we listen to each other's heart
Hercules!
Swing that hammer with all your might,
Oh yes he was.
I want to see
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
Consider its tree
And it's not my style This old town can slow you down
We got a hot crustacean band
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
One Song
Quando ele vem
Born with a hammer right in his hand. No mountain too high,
So proud, defiant,
Hope he doesn't see right through me
where we will; we'll roam. So many times out there
For his immortal soul Just so he's kept locked away
Moana, make way, make way!
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
Just take my hand
And wedding bells will ring
And now I know
Little wandering angel
Then somebody bends
Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads
Even he orders me around
Every morning just the same
And I got downhearted
and turn your sails to home. Yo ho, haul together,
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
But you can see
Ever entreating
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay! Mister Bluebird's on my shoulder
Be mine or you will burn Kyrie Eleison
Everybody look right
listen to the pate
That's made for you and me?
Now she's here suddenly I know
This inhuman beast
The most beautiful girl in town.
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute Bonjour
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
And no one knows how far it goes
You got to kiss the girl
Out in the sun they slave away
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
I wanna be a man, mancub
Bonjour
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special
I'm so shiny
Just let me in (just let me in) We only have each other (we only have each other)
te luelue
'Scuse me
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I've got no strings
Met her on the coast of Java
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear!
Never really knowing why
That's where we'll be
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Love is why we're seein' it eye to eye
Through the sapphire sky
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud.
Como uma canção
I'm here to answer all your midnight prayers,
Don't you derogate or deride
Well, thank you. Thank you very much Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
I can make us strong
Zero to hero
I'll never hide
Your 'eart starts beatin' like
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new
(C'mon, baby) eye to eye
He's the earth and heaven to you
John Henry is a powerful man.
Somehow I'll make a man out of you I'm never gonna catch my breath
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright
(Dies irae, dies illa)
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
John Henry is a mighty man.
I know every mile would be worth my while
I have but one song
You wanna kiss the girl Yes, you want her
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha! The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
Do what the music say
Shake my hand, come on boys
You'll find enchantment here
Come true... There you see her
