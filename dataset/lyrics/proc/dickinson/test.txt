Acres of seams where harvests were,
Of chariots that him convey,
To satin races he is nought;
They 'll carry him!
No other was denied.
Ashes denote that fire was;
Carried by men to-day,
He fumbles at your spirit
How cordial is the mystery!
That brooks in meadows run;
And visited the sea;
For the contented beggar's face
In ceaseless rosemary.
I must not put my foot amiss
The clouds their backs together laid,
Dear to the moss,
The hand that paused to gather
Candid in May,
And Sophocles a man;
And lick the valleys up,
Look to it, by its fathoms
Without a quicker blood,
Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,
From a familiar flower.
My feet, too, that had wandered so,
The cricket sang,
A deeper twilight on the lawn;
DISENCHANTMENT.
Any forgot by victory
Was he afraid, or tranquil?
So go your way and I'll go mine, —
A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,
Not any nearer for the child
On this late morn the sun;
We trust, in plumed procession,
Had it remained to speak.
And stepped like flakes of snow.
As slow her flambeaux burn away,
And as oft a cranny
Coach it insures, and footmen,
Harmless as streaks of meteor
To that odd fork in Being's road,
With no police to follow,
I would not, if I could,
And eider names.
The martyrs even trod,
   The ones that cite her most
That licked it from the coast;
Without the knowing why.
That ravished all the hill;
Haste! lest while you're lagging,
When was it, can you tell,
   My bonnet but to tie,
Perhaps you 're going too!
For such a noticing.
Upon a dandelion's sleeve —
How glad I am!
MARCH.
These are the patient laureates
My worthiness is all my doubt,
The field a scarlet gown.
   The bushes they were bells;
In seamless company.
'T was with text and village singing
At least, 't is mutual risk, —
To neighborhoods of pause;
A different Peru;
It reaches to the fence,
Around a pile of mountains,
Upon a marge of snow;
Then sprang before the hills
Exists in every human nature
My garner shows so fair.
Where we, with late, celestial face,
    I should have had the joy
   Termed Thanksgiving day,
   And so the night became.
TOO MUCH.
Soil of flint if steadfast tilled
Assassin, hid in our apartment,
Obtrude no more.
The dust did scoop itself like hands
   Of toads and men, —
   Into degreeless noon.
Were useless as next morning's sun,
Contracting in a field
XXIX.
Oh, find it, sir, for me!
When one who died for truth was lain
Just where the hectic stings!
Till that first shout got by,
   Which lead the seasons by,
As stars that drop anonymous
Except for its marauding hand,
To know if any human eyes were near
Ascend in ceaseless carol,
I think I won't, however,
XIV.
With her fastidious forehead?
XLVII.
Went up a year this evening!
Never did she lisp it,
Strangers strolled and spelled
THE BLUEBIRD.
   He trod upon the trees
I offered Being for it;
   They struggle some for breath,
   Than the hand of friend,
If town it have, beyond itself,
To break for you.
The lilacs, bending many a year,
I ceded all of dust I knew, —
       Stoops to an easy clover —
Unto his nest again,
   Their ballads were the same, —
TRANSPLANTED.
Enlarging loneliness.
Upon a toilsome way
That we've immortal place,
And grace would grant the pair.
Receives unblushingly!
   By the wizard sun!
It's so unkind of science
To hang our head ostensibly,
And there the matter ends.
But if he ask where you are hid
So foreign to my own.
   At once is mute again.
I never can decide;
For whom betrayed the dell,
The springtime's pallid landscape
Till when, around a crag,
Thine eyes impose on me.
What is only walking
I knew not but the next
Alter? When the hills do.
When night devoured the road;
   Still it be unfurled.
And praise as mere as blame.
If you would like to borrow
On schemes intent.
With half a smile and half a spurn,
And thread the dews all night, like pearls,
   Its explanation found!
As if it held but the might of a child;
A triumph when temptation's bribe
Upon the closet shelves.
Recollect the way, —
And sore must be the storm
Just to make bliss
Inherited with life,
As he, defeated, dying,
The grieved are many, I am told;
What will the solemn hemlock,
How life's reverberation
To make sure all's asleep.
As if the cloud that instant slit
'T is vegetation's juggler,
For circumstance the same.
I'm going all along!
   His merit all my fear,
Stealth's slow;
I hope the children there
I ever had, but one;
Riches were good.
INDIAN SUMMER.
Denominated "Death," —
There is a fitting a dismay,
Be its mattress straight,
On her divine majority
'T was such a little, little boat
Spinning upon the shoals!
As 't were a spur upon the soul,
They fling their speech
I have at last revenge.
Or help one fainting robin
   The doctor drives away.
While color's revelations break,
If you were coming in the fall,
And summer hid her forehead,
Till bullets clipt an angle,
   Such houses have alway.
To look upon her like, alive,
Give the one in red cravat
A few prosaic days
The thought behind I strove to join
With banquetings to be,
With "This was last her fingers did,"
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'
That on the acre lies.
A little farther on,
'T was short to cross the sea
I liked as well to see
I never thought to see,
Each was to each the sealed church,
A shady friend for torrid days
Until the morning sun,
Could keep a chancel cool.
And notwithstanding bee that worked,
Soft fall the sounds of Eden
Besides the autumn poets sing,
Had subjugated test,
Because — because if he should die
Of these no elegy.
For one must wait
   As nature's curtain fell
Almost a powdered footman
Himself could have the skies.
And this brief tragedy of flesh
With a bobolink for a chorister,
A DAY.
The heaven below the heaven above
To break it to the bee.
That don't remember you?
    Then crouch within the door.
I willed my keepsakes, signed away
And I my childish plumes
With but a fraction of the love
Here a star, and there a star,
I had rather dwell like her
And mine the distant sea, —
Hands bustled at the moorings —
The needle to the north degree
How many times they bore
Not an acre or a caption
To ponder little workmanships
So dazzling, we mistake him
How odd the girl's life looks
How a small dusk crawls on the village
Only the keeper of this seal
And then the milliner, and the man
So sailors say, on yesterday,
How many cups the bee partakes, —
Or amulets of pine.
Inaudible, indeed,
A flower expected everywhere;
   I might have aided thee.
   How doubly more
Indicative that suns go down;
A difference, a daisy,
    But when the vivid ore
Before they drop full music on;
I wished they 'd stay away
The palm without the Calvary;
How much can come
And I, for wonder at his woe,
   Nor once look up for noon?
Secure against its own,
Twice have I stood a beggar
On whose forbidden ear
The brain within its groove
Bring me the sunset in a cup,
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
And lighted with a match,
   The grave preceded me,
What liberty! So captives deem
Till all the churchyard rang;
So, wondering, thro' the hours meek
The tired flocks come in
It makes no difference abroad,
Put down your hat —
The morning lit, the birds arose;
Peculiar traveller comes?
And space stares, all around,
TOO LATE.
And taking but a prayer,
But prayer remained our side.
Yet interdict my blossom
For life's estate with you.
How the old steeples hand the scarlet,
Belted down with emerald;
How many times these low feet staggered,
Were as impossible as hand
Apart, intrinsic, stand,
On its axis turned, —
The trying on the utmost,
To comprehend a nectar
THE BAT.
How some one treated him;
And bowing with a mighty look
   And the world I used to know;
That darkness is about to pass.
XVI.
Scarlet experiment! sceptic Thomas,
I, trembling, drew the table near,
   Wrecked, solitary, here.
And he no consolation
Angels' breathless ballot
   Between the light and me;
The East put out a single flag,
Unto a silent sky
Somewhat of nods, and somewhat of
THE WAKING YEAR.
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Without my right of frost,
But never deemed the dripping prize
TRYING TO FORGET.
I touched her cradle mute;
In crayon or in wool,
Is mapped, and charted too!
This, and my heart, and all the fields,
When truth, affronted long,
Please God, might I behold him
We never know we go, — when we are going
And laugh at me, and stare!
Without a light
   A sort they call 'despair;'
A power of butterfly must be
SLEEPING.
   A crescent still abides,
A door just opened on a street —
With duds of emerald!
Kept beating, beating, till I thought
   This afternoon put on.
   The news that she is gone.
And tell each other how we sang
That "Whatsoever you shall ask,
Where ships of purple gently toss
And so, when all the time had failed,
It pleased my narrow eyes
Done with the compass,
I dared not open, lest a face
Upon the furthest slope we know;
Nor tell the loving forests
The figure of a nut
Who robbed the woods,
Death is like the insect
More fair, because impossible
For though they lock thee in the grave,
   And every clamor bright
   And see!
As one that drunken stepped;
Is not expressed by suns alone,
Some think it service in the place
   They would not rather die.
It suits his own austerity,
A face devoid of love or grace,
Lit with a ruby,
The revery alone will do
That skirts the acres of perhaps,
Past midnight, past the morning star!
   Bulb after bulb, in silver rolled,
And satisfy, obtained.
   Nor near enough to find;
That blame is just as dear as praise
XL.
   Answer me to wear?
A sudden musket spills.
   That gathered these to-day!
I never hear the word "escape"
A sepal, petal, and a thorn
For such the angels go,
I the dart revere.
In life's diverse bouquet,
   To tenderer renown.
Leaning against the sun!
And fitted to a frame,
O Jesus! in the air
   To call the little child,
A blue and gold mistake.
Write me how many notes there be
You asked the company to tea,
With a revolving wheel;
Within my reach!
Barbs has it, like a bee.
Till brooms fade softly into stars —
Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
   And satisfied a leaf,
Power is only pain,
While I was fearing it, it came,
Where revelations be.
She is held to-day, —
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
Imported to the wood;
Or cart of butterfly.
DEATH.
   For this enchanted size.
Could but a crier of the glee
He pays no rent, —
   Titian never told;
That we can touch the spaces,
   As syllable from sound.
Meanwhile at many cradles
She mentioned, and forgot;
   Leads the chosen child;
What could it hinder so, to say?
Between eternity and time,
A little water supplicate
The rest of life to see!
And leave me just my A B C,
You will know I'm trying
From enterprise below!
I missed mine. How dreary marbles,
I felt apology were due
I looked in windows, for the wealth
A little brig I knew, —
   How could I break my word?
The Tyrian would not come
   And put it in the drawer,
Trailed slow along the orchards
Except by butterflies,
If aught she missed in her new day
So nearly infinite.
The little toil of love, I thought,
Do the buds to them belong?
   Retrieve thine industry.
Their expectation fair;
Indolent housewife, in daisies lain!
Put out their tongues, for noon.
Tabernacle or tomb,
'T is the majority
My little maid, 't is night; alas,
So spices stimulate the time
When landlords turn the drunken bee
   Struck no one but myself,
Not with a club the heart is broken,
   Or none perceptible.
To see the little tippler
   I beheld her next,
I went to heaven, —
Was it Goliath was too large,
The parties in both cases
Unties her yellow bonnet
I never thought that Jason sought
IN THE GARDEN.
Conform my soul as 't were a church
The stars about my head I felt,
They hear my unexpected knock.
Of clovers and of noon!
If met in ether sea
Surgeons must be very careful
And leaves the shreds behind;
On winter afternoons,
The patent lost
AT LENGTH.
Try! can you stir the awful rivet?
And shut the door unto my house;
When roses cease to bloom, dear,
And then be soldered down,
The clouds, like listless elephants,
The stimulus, beyond the grave
Despair!
Permitted gods and me.
To my quick ear the leaves conferred;
I've finished threading too.
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
That till I loved
As when 't was cut at Lexington,
Until the designated light
   No more to do have I,
Whom I have never found
SUSPENSE.
That they pronounce my name.
Can the sailor understand
That which sings so, speaks so,
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
Nor vengeance ever comes!
To pick another day.
   Quietly did the same,
The farthest thunder that I heard
With just the door ajar
Behold the atom I preferred
When the robins come,
The grave it was, reposed upon
Still chafes its narrow bed;
   The pillow for my head.
To times when he was young.
Mirth is the mail of anguish,
   I groped upon his breast.
It's like the morning, —
    August, 1891.
The thinking how they walked alive,
Two butterflies went out at noon
This side the victory!
And whistled in the air,
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
Some rumor of delirium
A COUNTRY BURIAL.
Its past, enlightened to perceive
The gown that Dante deified.
The eyes of many elves.
He grasped, he bore away.
And deal occasional smiles
MABEL LOOMIS TODD
Look back on time with kindly eyes,
When floods have slit the hills,
This, and my heart, and all the bees
   Eternity until.
A few ascetic eyes, —
Where you were not,
Arranged themselves around their prince
He was the faithful father
    Repudiate the forge.
    Recited fluent here.
Our pace took sudden awe,
As much abasheth me.
The distance would not haunt me so;
And then I looked at them,
   When sacrament is done.
To take the honorable work
   That some are like my own.
But not again that dew was seen
External ghost,
But meat within is requisite,
And nobody knows, so still it flows,
The summer lapsed away, —
At such a curious earth!
I know, and they know me;
One little maid from playmates,
In the silent west
And glance securely round.
   But what must be the smile
Decades of arrogance between
To a fine, pedantic sunshine
I will of you!
The crowd retire with an oath
   A thing that can ignite
How happy is the little stone
His venerable hand to take,
Before the blackbirds sing.
But never quaked before.
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Of its condensed despatch.
Had not the bliss so slow a pace, —
How softly sinks his trembling sun
And hold the sunshine in its lap
Past interview, and vow,
Great clouds like ushers leaning,
But this time, adequate, erect,
It 's time to smooth the hair
Went past my simple shoe,
   Not loud enough for wind;
Nothing to show
Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?
To feel if blinds be fast,
RESURRECTION.
THE SHELTER.
Let us go with thee!
Close to the two I lost!
Of all the souls that stand create
And wishes, had he any?
Nobody knows the place, —
And put them each in separate drawers,
As if for you to choose,
We are the flower, Thou the sun!
Unto the sofa opposite,
Afternoons to play.
I died for beauty, but was scarce
Should reach so small a goal!
   'T is bliss I cannot weigh,
   Or if it be before,
To whom this would have pointed me
My holiday shall be
Our luxury!
While she must finish quite,
TO MARCH.
       Like the June bee
We, prone to periphrasis,
A pair of spectacles ajar just stir —
I never saw the sea;
   Her tarrying unknown;
Of time's uncertain wing,
Wild-flowers kindle in the woods,
Their velvet masonry
   ''T was only a balloon.'
    Yellow she affords
No lifetime set on them,
Ajar, secure, inviting;
Wherever runs the breathless sun,
Nor lisp it at the table,
To witness to the certainty
Discretion in the interval,
My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
The rat is the concisest tenant.
That I did always love,
No person testified.
The heart asks pleasure first,
Soul, wilt thou toss again?
Incites the timid prayer
Than that, be sweeter wise;
Until the moss had reached our lips,
None can avoid this purple,
Attended or alone,
She recognized the foot,
That whiter host.
   Just when the grave and I
And they the daffodils!
Confronting sudden pelf, —
Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred
None evade this crown.
Apparelled as the new
Could she have guessed that it would be;
When August, burning low,
DEATH AND LIFE.
To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Dropped by memory.
Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness. Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic has said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession," it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare.
XLIV.
Who of little love
Show them this meek apparelled thing,
I wore an hour ago.
Within the fields lie low,
Or first prospective, or the gold
It might have been the waning lamp
The rose is out of town.
Then dropped from sight.
Did they come back no more?"
It was a common night,
And now an amethyst remembrance
Such transport breaks upon the town
   Since none of them are mine.
I shall but drink the more!
That travellers had thrown,
By fainter hammers, further heard,
Went wandering down the latitudes,
And heaven not enough for me;
In the new robin's ecstasy
Summer, sister, seraph,
Baptized before without the choice,
Scares muslin souls away;
When night is almost done,
A MAN.
A Heavenly Father would content,
   Or did it just begin?
Then there 's a pair of us — don't tell!
   The water lives so far,
And bow to everything;
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
With an opposing cloud,
And so, upon this wise I prayed, —
A lord might dare to lift the hat
If wilderness prevent her feet,
Lest we too awkward show
If any ask me how,
   A mob of solid bliss.
Myself a millionnaire
The soul unto itself
He sits erect in cabinets,
   Chime noon.
It's sorer to believe!
To say good-by to men.
Me! Hear! My foreign ear
Assent, and you are sane;
An anguish at the mention,
And started for the sun.
I crave him grace, of summer boughs,
Too happy in my sparrow chance
The breaking of the day.
There is a word
   That only childhood knows.
The birds put up the bars to nests,
By ear unheard,
A kingdom's title-deed, —
In danger, other impetus
And he owned all the mourners now,
I like a look of agony,
   To look her in the face
By tropic hint, — some travelled bird
If such a little figure
The gnash of northern winds
   And lay the marble tea,
And putting love away
Behind the shelf
Unto the east again.
To firmaments of sun,
A piercing comfort it affords
With threatening tunes and low, —
Their ribbons just beyond the eye,
   Portentous inference,
   And Being's beggary.
For that old faded midnight
There are, that resting, rise.
Burglar, banker, father,
Supplanted all the rest.
Proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,
Sneer — "Where?"
The smallest "robe" will fit me,
It is an honorable thought,
Whose voices, trained below,
They say that 'time assuages,' —
A spider sewed at night
   We took the mystery.
   Bequeaths him to the night.
Though drifted deep in parian
And past my bodice too,
To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some time in the finished picture.
No color in the rainbow
   It wandered from the same.
To help our bleaker parts
When butterflies renounce their drams,
At centre of the sea,
The time was scarce profaned by speech;
   Is tarnished by the snow,
Whose invitation, knew you not
The parlor of the day!
One would as soon assault a plush
   Replenished, — faith cannot.
Full purple is his state!
   For just this single time;
ETERNITY.
His face all victory,
   Thy flower forevermore!
Where I have rambled so,
     By boy descried,
The track called land.
Too rescued; fear too dim to me
Its temple stands alway
A perfect, paralyzing bliss
In timid honesty.
   I kept the 'house at hame.'
I think that earth seems so
The trusting woods?
When, stooping to secure it,
Did try to chalk the sun
Beyond my power to deem, —
   In epauletted white,
And see you freeze,
   For refuse and the mouse,
A PORTRAIT.
Many sails at rest,
   Elate philosopher!
   His never slumbering plan;
I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.
   A world must be
The house of supposition,
It fills with alabaster wool
IX.
   Now shadows in the tomb.
Rocked softer, to and fro?
As for the lost we grapple,
The tapestries of paradise
A privilege of hurricane
And then it knocks at will.
I clap my hands to see;
RESURGAM.
A spider at his trade again;
Motionless as peace.
Laurel! veil your deathless tree, —
Of cautious melody.
And when the sun goes down
Weary, perhaps, and sore.
   The altitude of me?
On such a dawn, or such a dawn,
NATURE'S CHANGES.
If only centuries delayed,
A clover, any time, to him
In an adjoining room.
A print of a vermilion foot;
We gave no other bond.
THE OUTLET.
Through the straight pass of suffering
Unnoticed as a single dew
Some things that fly there be, —
   Private like breeze,
You beg him not to go;
Never a thimble more shall wear.
Where no breakers roar,
With a departing, sapphire feature,
How red their faces grew!
Nor where it went, nor why it came
The most familiar guest.
Of a delivered syllable,
People like the moth,
VIII.
His observation omnifold,
   The focus of my prayer, —
Quaint or broken;
TRIUMPH.
"How pleasanter," said she
   That I dare to tell?
But Death had told her so the first,
The dreamy butterflies bestir,
Since the mighty autumn afternoon
I recollect it well!
It stops upon a spot
When all the children sleep
To strange, bright crowds of flowers,
She's 'sorry I am dead,' again,
I 'm glad I don't believe it,
Tell me how far the morning leaps,
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, —
But early yet for God;
That deaden suffering;
And birds of foreign tongue!
And wishes, and denies, —
A sofa to the air.
Fire exists the first in light,
Her companies astir, —
The maples never knew
And went against the world;
Will peep, and prance again.
Deals one imperial thunderbolt
THE JOURNEY.
THE MYSTERY OF PAIN.
Ah, brig, good-night
XXV.
Their liquid feet go softly out
A vastness, as a neighbor, came, —
VENTURES.
Of amplitude, or awe,
No easier divest
How luscious lies the pea within
Stooping, plucking, sighing, flying;
POEMS
On such a night, or such a night,
Keeps esoteric time.
Take me!
Imperfectly beheld, —
Behold, what curious rooms!
From some old fortress on the sun
'T is that I cannot say;
Inebriate of air am I,
A chief indifference, as foreign
My soul's at liberty
Celebrated part at table,
So I get home, 't will compensate.
THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.
Remorse is cureless, — the disease
Ticked softly into one.
He did not know I saw;
   To notoriety.
   Upon a daily street,
Who, till they died, did not alive become;
The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, —
Old-fashioned, naughty, everything, —
I first surmised the horses' heads
Would not the fun
   From Nature's sentinels.
Still fascinated to presume
THE WHITE HEAT.
    Her loving bosom lay.
Can't put the puppet bowing
The breezes madder play.
At period of going down —
Acknowledged of the brave, —
The shutting of the eye.
REMEMBRANCE.
The children of whose turbaned seas,
One the shutters drew —
And passed their curtains by.
Intent upon the vision
Until eternity.
To let a beetle pass.
SECRETS.
   When Richard went to mill;
   Or a holiday,
This was in the white of the year,
To see that I made no mistake
   Exultant, onward sped!
It shames the constancy that fled
Here was no notice, no dissent,
Itself be given you."
It sickened fresh upon my sight
And rowed him softer home
And a softness the teller's eye;
For my little damask maid.
Who knocks? That April!
And made as he would eat me up
   How vast an one
As wholly as a dew
   I charge him, fly!
Think of it, lover! I and thee
You cannot prick with saw,
    "Because, sir, love is sweet!"
While the old couple, just astir,
Of an entire attar
A PRAYER.
       Homesick for steadfast honey,
   To stay as if, or go.
And then declines forever
A clock stopped — not the mantel's;
Excellent and fair.
Had he the power to spurn!
That gaze upon his journey;
Break, agonized and clear!
And if, indeed, I fail,
Nor was I hungry; so I found
Could I but ride indefinite,
Interrupt this ground.
That love is life,
   Gave his breath away.
IV.
   Until, to her surprise,
Than mayest thou,
If tenderer industriousness
When breath blew back,
   At bottom of my mind;
   And crucifixion known.
And the rest?
The orchis binds her feather on
As far from time as history,
Lapland's necessity.
Behold his lost emolument
You, too, take cobweb attitudes
Approached, the amber flits a little, —
Sweet litigants for life.
   Or a fife's small fame,
   Have passed beyond the sun,
   The lightning was as new
Bless God, he went as soldiers,
It spun and spun,
       As well the sky
But this must be a different wealth,
And so, as kinsmen met a night,
   Geneva's farthest skill
If I couldn't thank you,
Sauntered as soft away!
Frequently the woods are pink,
What necklaces could be!
He were superfluous every day,
Grief, hills, eternity:
Obedient to the least command
Which both of benediction
   And thanked the ample friend;
Although I prove it just in time
I had a guinea golden;
The regiment of wood and hill
I reason, we could die:
But large enough for me.
And tantalize, just so.
Except to stray abroad
This, dost thou doubt, sweet?
   About my feet the sea.
To go and interfere!
II. LOVE.
    Of life's penurious round;
The spangled gowns, a lesser rank
And still the aprons fly,
With shapeless, quivering prayer
Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy, she lived in its presence.
Say, sea,
And silenced, as the awful sea
And shadows tremble so?
Upon the apple-tree.
Till I should jump peninsulas
No ordinance is seen,
   A function fresh obtain? —
Of cathedral tunes.
By just such a hazard
    A wind with fingers goes.
I wonder if the sepulchre
From our gross eyes.
   These gentlewomen are!
That each can make but once,
Consented, and was dead.
A February day,
For the departed creature's sake
Except thyself may be
No treason it can fear;
Say, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
Among the pensive trees.
Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!
A cheek is always redder
But that the little figure
But should the play
Why floods are served to us in bowls, —
   And subsequent to find
COBWEBS.
And claim the rank to die!
'Mong such unique
Bind one, and one will flee.
   Eternally unknown.
Fern-odors on untravelled roads, —
   The undeveloped freight
That made existence home!
So helpless when I turned
A smile suffused Jehovah's face;
And then, those little anodynes
Of the minutest cricket,
Emerged — a summer afternoon —
   Upon the world below.
   And all the meadows wide.
He stayed away a year, to call
Or in the desert cloy, —
A little this side of the snow
Or bees, that thought the summer's name
Then prate about "preferment"
Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
   'A soul has gone to God,'
His table 's spread too high for us
That I stopped gauging, satisfied,
   It is just as well!
   It's easy as a sign, —
That you, so late, consider me,
Indeed, I 'm too astonished
   Just a bridge away;
That gentlemen so sprightly
Some shook their heads, and others smiled,
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And came my way no more.
A star not far enough to seek,
With those same boots of lead, again.
   Would feel as thoroughly at ease
And Mr. Thomson's sheaves.
As unto crowd.
       Invites the race;
   We were content to show,
I 've met the thing before;
Nor tie to earths to come,
That slipped my simple fingers through
To such a modest clay,
No summer could for them;
Toll, for the bonnie souls, —
Behind my native town.
Is sweetest nutriment to him,
Just so far goes away.
And on the strangest sea;
XXII.
With only butterflies to brood,
   This pendulum of snow;
   Some say.
    My spirit cannot see?
One little mind from school, —
   Upon a common summer's morn,
   To rest, — to rest would be
AT HOME.
Read then of faith
   Many sciences
A transport may reward us,
A myriad daisies play.
   Or sunset's yellow play
The stray ships passing spied a face
Who charge within the bosom,
In broken mathematics
Till sundown crept, a steady tide,
THE ROBIN.
   She felled — he did not fall —
Where other creatures put their eyes,
   And mourners, to and fro,
A rich man might not notice it;
And throw away the road.
   Auspiciously withheld.
I thought how yellow it would look
Within the Orchard is not heard,
There is a flower that bees prefer,
What was his furthest mind, of home, or God,
I bring thee proof:
I knew so perfect yesterday, —
And trades as briskly fly.
And Occident becomes unknown,
In his eternal chair,
But he is mastered now,
Since breaking then, since breaking then,
THE BRAIN.
And has her in a class.
So ominous did pass
Their glory nought to me;
Which little yellow boys and girls
   Gush after gush, reserved for you;
Sauntering this way,
Can tell the definition,
Admonished by her buckled lips
New feet within my garden go,
Of freckled human nature,
   In scholastic skies!
When simple you and I
That brews that rare variety.
I should not fear the foe then,
   Than numb three-score and ten.
Covert in April,
I hide myself within my flower,
   Corn is made at noon,
Afraid to trust the morn
And awe was all we could feel.
With her cherubic quantity,
Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window;
Some pale reporter from the awful doors
And ruddier than the gown
A WELL.
I pull a flower from the woods, —
Whose are the beds, the tiny beds
He laboreth at every tree, —
In sovereign, swerveless tune.
Is the eclat of death.
And thrown her furthest stone,
Lest interview annul a want
This traverse may the poorest take
Retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails
A SERVICE OF SONG.
Would the Eden be an Eden,
THE DUEL.
And debauchee of dew,
That held the dams had parted hold,
By souls of sanity,
You must have walked —
   His eccentricities.
When Fate hath taunted last
And opens further on.
The reefs in old Gethsemane
So gradual the grace,
In dun or fair.
Was it the mat winked,
With nosegays at the head and foot,
   Of Deity ashamed, —
To food
   Her cheek like beryl stone;
Is shifted like a sand;
   At distance than at hand.
"Tell him night finished before we finished,
To counteract a knock;
"The sleet than May — no thee!"
   There Paradise is found!
   Of all the martial blest.
Is terribler than wearing it
Like mighty footlights burned the red
Fate following behind us bolts it,
"Creator! shall I bloom?"
I looked at sunrise once,
In cave if I presumed to hide,
I left them in the ground.
Low amid that glad Belles lettres
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
A coronet to find;
   But dapperer, more sweet;
With hurried, few, express reports
I would as soon attempt to warm
Gathered from many wanderings,
Disparagement discreet, —
To which the law entitled him.
He 'd be too tall, the tallest one
Past sunrise! Ah! what leagues there are
At least to pray is left, is left.
That frightened but an hour.
To put the water back
Drowning is not so pitiful
PRECEDENCE.
Then look out for the little brook in March,
'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,
My river runs to thee:
The sounds of welcome near!
The wizard-fingers never rest,
Where hope and he part company, —
Yet to my frugal eye
Afterwards — day!
   Phantasms both become,
Would overflow with pearl.
And held my ears, and like a thief
She felt herself supremer, —
The eye had hurried by,
THE RAILWAY TRAIN.
A caper in the trees, —
It sifts from leaden sieves,
Drab habitation of whom?
Who never thirsted, flagons
A resonance of emerald,
A pensive custom it becomes,
Lest noon in everlasting night
I'm wife; I've finished that,
The skies can't keep their secret!
That such was not the posture
The lightning showed a yellow beak,
THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.
They tell it to the hills —
Till it an antique fashion shows
   Of fingers going by.
If I should disappoint the eyes
With just a clock, —
