Her face is rounder than the moon,
   To no precarious man.
That it can so endure
   Till, some odd afternoon,
Some found it mutual gain;
Till broad as Buenos Ayre,
APRIL.
Fantastic sailors mingle,
Who failed to touch us all,
   Or emptied by the sun
For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb
Some epauletted brother
They say that He can heal;
Artist, who drew me so,
The bustle in a house
Be debonair! Be debonair!
   I could not see to see.
Into the boiling sand.
Beetle at the candle,
It listening, listening, went to sleep
I worked for chaff, and earning wheat
Crumbs fit such little mouths,
I heard the buckle snap,
   Death had the same design;
As one encountered gentlefolk
   And little boys besides;
   How sleek the woe appears
   Bloom I strove to raise.
Tell him — No, you may quibble there,
A fear will urge it where
Henceforth a dedicated sort,
Without commander, countless, still,
Her deathless syllable.
   And we look farther on.
Domenichino dropped the pencil,
And 't was not for me;
Wending late home,
On the heavenly fame.
   The maddest, quickest by;
The wealth might disappoint,
To wonder what myself will say,
Did not talk of returning,
Enamoured of the parting west,
His caravan of red,
The bravest of the host,
Dungeons may call, and guns implore;
Who danger and the dead had faced,
As laughter was an hour ago,
   Part in memory.
You drifted your dominions
Staid sleeping there.
For two divided, briefly,
Safe in their alabaster chambers,
With one small diadem.
   Some disease had vexed;
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so
The crowd respectful grew.
   How easy all can see
You almost feel the date,
   Ascribe no less the praise;
And this untoward transport
One dignity delays for all,
Or else a peacock's purple train,
   And violets are done,
Knock, recollect, for me!
Taketh away my will;
And failed to wake them up,
If spoken by the distant bird,
Little leontodon.
   'T is something like a house;
Parched the flowers they bear along.
I've heard the hunter tell;
And then I wanted to get out,
Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!
Before the world is green
There's been a death in the opposite house
Of tassels and of coaches soon;
Yet not in all the nests I meet
Which like the moon, some turbid night,
And one, below this morning,
Than be Duke of Exeter
   That, in so dense a fuzz,
That beckoned it away!
RETICENCE.
With the blue-birds buccaneering
An actual suffering strengthens,
This is the errand of the eye
And drove away the leaves
By what mystic mooring
And whatsoever insect pass,
Of mines I little know, myself,
One little boat gave up its strife,
It is not hymn from pulpit read, —
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
   Gracious unto none.
For her old lover, Don the Sun,
Out of the foxglove's door,
Nor this behooveth me.
Might dare to touch it now!
   Permitted face to face to be;
I took my power in my hand.
You there, I here,
Lost doubly, but by contrast most,
   Did they forsake thee?
That sat it down to rest,
So sunset shuts my question down
Next to the robin
All, for him, straightway.
And the cycles wheel.
Unscrutinized by eye.
And who could reproduce the sun,
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.
So bashful when I spied her,
WITH A FLOWER.
To justify despair.
The solemn contract of a life
And coffers heaped with tears.
They "noticed" me — they noticed me;
But she slept.
It's finer not to know;
As a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial," "A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named by their author, frequently at the end,—sometimes only in the accompanying note, if sent to a friend.
Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing
LI.
Hate cannot harm
The brain is just the weight of God,
That only to the ear of God
Should the glee glaze
LV.
I never saw before
MY DEAR FRIEND,— What portfolios full of verses you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and generation" that you will not give them light.
Looking back is best that is left,
   Be witnessed in his power.
And wade in liberty?
Before the harbor lie.
An overcoat of clay.
   For this was woman's son.
Phraseless, yet it stirs
SONG.
Bitter contested farthings
Better will be the ecstasy
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.
The monster's faded eyes
A bird, by chance, that goes that way
   An independent one.
By this great light upon our minds
Then a silence suffuses the story,
And turned away, imperial,
And infiniter care,
It's like the bee, —
   Of our immortal mind,
One need not be a house;
To gain the purple democrat
And then — the wharf is still.
     The lowliest career
And like a bubble hie.
Regards with patriot love.
The news would strike me dead!
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
As if I breathed superior air,
Beguiled of immortality,
The spider as an artist
And then I come away.
The old, old sophistries of June, —
As twilight long begun,
That devastated childhood's realm,
Heart not so heavy as mine,
Without a color but the light
Of all the sounds despatched abroad,
Almost contented
Our lives are Swiss, —
The roof was scarcely visible,
DAY'S PARLOR.
As housewives do a fly.
   And bees abashless play,
I simulate the breath so well,
That is the break of day.
The hillsides must not know it,
A novel agony,
Their height in heaven comforts not,
Without her diadem.
With but a single star,
Their faith the everlasting troth;
Of dawn the ancestor.
   Seek it with the knife,
Denoted by the white;
Come slowly, Eden!
The cattle fled to barns;
A newer Sevres pleases,
Just lost when I was saved!
Until their time befalls.
I tasted wheat, — and hated chaff,
Himself, himself inform.
Grant, God, he charge the bravest
LOYALTY.
And dream the days away, —
Because I could not stop for Death,
That men must slake in wilderness,
   But then I had the dew!
To sound or circumvent,
   Best when it's done, —
The heaven the creeds bestow.
A heaven of heavens, the privilege
An arc alike inscrutable, —
When it goes, 't is like the distance
   As players at the keys
Pursuing winds that censure us
Aromatic, low,
   A soldier's — balls. Who asketh more
   There is its victory!
No bone had he to bind him,
And then, as if the hands
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
I should have been too glad, I see,
If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee and executor. Surely after you are what is called "dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think we have a right to withhold from the world a word or a thought any more than a deed which might help a single soul. . . .
Earth would have been too much, I see,
If I can stop one heart from breaking,
And I 'd like to look a little more
I wonder if it hurts to live,
THE INEVITABLE.
I had no cause to be awake,
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.
The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes.
Reverently to the hungry
Just felt the world go by!
Grave saints stole out to look at me,
Oh, last communion in the haze,
Across a barn or through a rut
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!
PURPLE CLOVER.
And yet with amber hands
PREFACE
'T is but the ecstasy of death,
The Jesuit of orchards,
THE PAST.
SATISFIED.
So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
Because I know it 's true;
The playthings of her life
Deposed, at length, the grave —
I thought that such were for the saints,
But what of that?
Save just a little place for me
And if I gain, — oh, gun at sea,
   And begets her spot.
An instant's width of warmth disclosed,
I sing to use the waiting,
The breezes fetch along,
   And guinea in the sand, —
When, were the gales propitious,
Who never climbed the weary league —
A portico,
GHOSTS.
I feel as if the grass were pleased
Finite to fail, but infinite to venture.
Guides still the sun along the crag
   Is plenty! Is enough!
She rose to his requirement, dropped
   And left it in the sky.
For period exhaled.
   That dot his distant eaves,
   For, lift them, pound for pound,
Its white foot tripped,
     Of which it died.
A troubadour upon the elm
And then he drank a dew
And bells keep saying 'victory'
   Almost to jealousy.
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn
And when her breath was done,
A privilege, I think,
All this, and more I cannot tell,
In death's stiff stare,
But most like chaos, — stopless, cool, —
By but a simple arrow
It's such a little thing to weep,
And then, obscure with fog,
   The woods exchange a smile —
But where it fell
   For the upper air!
At evening it is not;
And Beatrice wore
And visions vast and small.
They perished in the seamless grass, —
You left for me to hue;
LIV.
Ascended from our vision
   Bold it were to die
That new grace
Ring, for the scant salvation!
As it has usual done;
   A night or two ago,
Who hath suffered him.
Brewed from decades of agony!
A SNAKE.
These emerald seams enclose.
'T is almost consequence,
And warming in our own,
A wishfulness their far condition
Wait till the majesty of Death
The soul should always stand ajar,
Endears in the departure
That bustle so illustrious
To that new marriage, justified
I could not hope to own.
That maketh all things new.
A jar across the flowers goes,
Minor apparatus, hopper of the mill,
A swelling of the ground;
For my will goes the other way,
THE LOST THOUGHT.
Maintain by accident
The only secret people keep
Fritters itself away!
The wealth I had contented me;
As if my life were shaven
Does not concern the bee;
Was bridal e'er like this?
When just this time, some perfect year,
Cautious, hint to any captive
But sequence ravelled out of reach
   When there's no one here, —
But somewhere in my soul, I know
It dropped so low in my regard
UNRETURNING.
   Through centuries above,
I am poor once more!
It cannot recollect
   By my own choice and thee.
And wandered in my face.
   What abstinence is there!
All these did conquer; but the ones
Is there such a thing as day?
     As that exalted here.
The meteor of birds,
A heaven not so large as yours,
Were climbing all the while
   Of his elect content,
   It shall belong to me,
And saints to windows run,
I bring an unaccustomed wine
   And tumbles in the sea.
XXI.
Till the children ask, "But the forty?
Is but the gleam concomitant
Behold! Whose multitudes are these?
       By climbing slow,
Heart, we will forget him!
I don't know when,
The fashion of the ear
In an emergency!
In this, as all, prevails.
And then to dwell in sovereign barns,
To see if time was there.
No furrow on the glow,
   It yet remains to see
Since I hoped I dared;
Her triple suit as sweet
Be the perfect one.
   Which are out of sight?
Nor even of defeat aware
The "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death, by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without important exception, her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse.
   Between the heaves of storm.
Of mechlin, frames,
Doth of the dew:
That like the drunkard goes;
That others could exist
'T is starving makes it fat.
Just laying off, for evidence,
Playmates, and holidays, and nuts,
SUPERIORITY TO FATE.
   Is difficult to learn.
And zero at the bone.
   As sponges, buckets do.
Father, I bring thee not myself, —
She doth not wait for June;
The subtle cargoes lie.
Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?
Then close the valves of her attention
Is pungent evergreens;
His inquest everywhere.
It was not frost, for on my flesh
Life is but life, and death but death!
To know just how he suffered would be dear;
    Have climbed the distant hill;
   So still, so cool,
How very blithe the fingers
Heaven is what I cannot reach!
A flash of dew, a bee or two,
THE BLUE JAY.
Debates if it will go.
   Enjoining secrecy, —
   Till we are called to rise;
Except through this extent,
Did not ourselves the cubits warp
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Next time, to stay!
A book I have, a friend gave,
   When summer days are flown!
And doesn't care about careers,
That scalding one, "Sabachthani,"
   For duties diamond.
Then chase itself down hill
The germ of alibi;
   However good to see,
Nearest the door to wake the first,
That such a little figure
In the receipt. It was the distance
'T is first I lock the door,
Now, when I read, I read not,
What if the poles should frisk about
THE TEST.
XLIX.
But since the last included both,
   At daybreak overcome!
What they renounced,
Death's privilege?
    That soundless tugs within,
The trampled steel that springs;
Velvet people from Vevay,
And stir all day to pretty tunes
Let him be quick, the viand flits,
But when it leaves us for a time,
Then, as horizons step,
With hat in hand, polite and new,
All swindlers be, infer.
An axe shrill singing in the woods;
Bred as we, among the mountains,
   Would never be believed.
CALLED BACK.
   I stand alive to-day
Creation impotent to help,
A legacy of love
   Without a listener?
   And abrogate my bee,
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
You cannot fold a flood
It makes an even face
And led the flock away.
For credibility's temerity
Our share of night to bear,
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!
   But decoyed may be.
Than tell.
To match the grandmamma,
   How nonchalant the wood,
Than gain my blue peninsula
Borne, without dissent of either,
     Till it fell,
It founds the homes and decks the days,
A half unconscious queen;
'T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou
   Touching all the grass
   But came with less of fear,
And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.
The dust replaced in hoisted roads,
And could not bear to shut until
The nuts are getting brown;
When I at last awake.
Also, who leads the docile spheres
   So stately they ascend
So's liberty.
   Then I remember not;
   Whose adequate supply
Soft overheard the whole.
The lightning that preceded it
   In parlors shut by day.
This audience of idleness
The lips I would have cooled, alas!
For you served Heaven, you know,
Recording briefly, "Lost."
   How different we are!
For whom I must decline?
personal origin. It is more than probable that it was
A watch, some ancient brooch
The housewife's gentle task.
Who overcame most times
Mine, here in vision and in veto!
   And if to mourn were gay,
   Birds, by the snow.
FAREWELL.
And Dnieper wrestlers run.
Obviate parade.
I wish I were the hay!
I stepped from plank to plank
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Death is a dialogue between
   And undermined the years!
She was mute from transport,
There's plunder, — where?
       Then to the royal clouds
Thine is the stillest night,
   That lawful orchards mocks;
A purple finger on the slope;
An epicure, a thief, —
Give Himmaleh, —
RETROSPECT.
Me! Come! My dazzled face
Where two could creep:
And though the sum was simple,
Supposed that he had come to dwell,
Sleep is supposed to be,
I think just how my lips will weigh
That threatened childhood's citadel
That oppresses, like the weight
Whistled itself a tune, —
Merry that it is morn,
SUNSET.
I con that thing, — "forgiven," —
As guest who would be gone.
Through Calvaries of Love!
   Who own the ample sea;
I wondered which would miss me least,
Till the evening, nearing,
Far safer, of a midnight meeting
And tell you all your dreams were true;
    Faith faints to understand.
Yet to my irritated ear
Earn her own surprise!
And cipher at the sign,
As cautiously as glass,
Next time, to tarry,
That spices fly
Beware, lest this little brook of life
And like a host, "Come in,"
Who since they went to their account
   Or noons report away,
These fleshless lovers met,
In your new-fashioned world!
His fantasy to please.
Where bashful flowers blow,
   Extinct be every hum,
As trade had suddenly encroached
Or sought to;
How frugal is the chariot
     The hospitable pall
A face with which a stone
   Then space began to toll
Deputed from what firmament
Turned slowly to his native coast,
Adjusted in the tomb,
Of the mysterious bard!
And blushing birds go down to drink,
Upon her friend she could bestow
The "tune is in the tree,"
Are out of sight, in heaven.
For certainly her way might pass
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Without a chance or spar,
       Lifts his light pinnace
   As if my brain had split;
Submits that home and certainty
And still she plies her spotted brooms,
Until it settled firm on Paradise.
   And when I sought my bed,
To take a backward look.
   For all the rest of life.
The soul with strict economy
The birds, in docile rows,
No rack can torture me,
Wooden barred,
CHILDISH GRIEFS.
Or a glee among the garrets,
   Who may expected be?
This limitless hyperbole
A murmur in the trees to note,
   So adequate its forms,
I reason that in heaven
And yet the crowd applauds below;
I 've often seen them play
At half-past seven, element
   And the brake of dun!
Italicized, as 't were.
   The loss of an estate,
How out of breath you are!
Or service of a keel,
Did the paradise, persuaded,
Or, haply, mistletoe.
Which, when to patience grown,
Had He the offer of;
To us, the duller scholars
I take the clew divine.
Guides the little one predestined
Enhances nature now.
To offer whom a chair
   And later, when we die,
It tried to be a rose
An awe came on the trinket!
A robber 'd like the look of, —
   What ultimate for that?
And then, excuse from pain;
Choose one;
Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
A marrowless assembly
Some other thirsty there may be
But only on my forehead stopped,
Repairing everywhere,
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
Her forehead is of amplest blond;
   As lately as to-day.
(The wind is prince of those).
Without apparent burden,
Or has it feathers like a bird,
No man drew.
What then? Why, nothing, only,
And whatsoever is consumed
   And only nails the eyes.
I do not care about it,
       Heedless of the boy
Could finish enmity.
   He feeds upon the fair;
Nor could I rise with you,
Then shuts the door;
   For the ethereal blow,
What inn is this
Not even God can heal;
I'll put a trinket on.
Who went to thank her;
WAITING.
Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;
In which it cautions arm,
ENDING.
The silence like an ocean rolled,
We never know how high we are
XLVI.
Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand,
   His remedy for care, —
And Judgment twinkled, too,
This world is not conclusion;
And made the hurry plain.
A rush of cochineal;
Oh, some wise man from the skies!
VOID.
    Of unanointed blaze.
Demur, — you're straightway dangerous,
A few incisive mornings,
   To lose it in the sea,
How public, like a frog
   To sleep its shape away, —
The robin is the one
Baronial bees march, one by one,
   Accompanied with tear,
If I shouldn't be alive
   Is immaterial.
With such a practised frost,
Far safer through an Abbey gallop,
This new circumference, have blamed
   A good news should be given.
L.
I noticed people disappeared,
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
But turning back 't was slow.
The hills untied their bonnets,
Could I see it from the mountains
The banquet of abstemiousness
And even when it dies, to pass
The Queen of Calvary.
I had no time to hate, because
Society.
The brain is deeper than the sea,
You could not.
   Nor tambourine, nor man;
As will suffice to light her lamps;
It was not night, for all the bells
One of the ones that Midas touched,
The way I read a letter 's this:
Like a cup
Less skilful than Leverrier
Because the winds would find it out,
And mice won't bark;
XXXII.
The quiet nonchalance of death
Sailing silently,
While he, victorious, tilts away
Our little sexton sings.
And then I heard them lift a box,
And this bequest of wings
   In such a little while!
Handle the adamantine fingers
   So larger to my eyes
What if I file this mortal off,
I shall forget the drop of anguish
Where the meanings are.
Her sturdy little countenance
May be a common thing,
Better than larger values,
   Not that we tire of thee,
Leap, plashless, as they swim.
And that was in the sod;
Or a nervous star?
Some new equation given;
A mighty afternoon;
Meet tranquilly as friends,
THANKSGIVING DAY.
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?
Far feet of failing men,
And if my stocking hung too high,
But just before the snows
So intimate have we become
Sufficient troth that we shall rise —
A long, long yellow on the lawn,
But this sort grieved myself, and so
He will tell me what Peter promised,
It is not fit for table,
But I could never sell.
Will the frock I wept in
Birds, hours, the bumble-bee:
His fashions quaint, mosaic,
And then it closes at your feet
Her heart misgives her for her vow,
To hold my life, and hold my ears,
Its infinite realms contain
How sweet it would have tasted,
But did because they died, — a fact
Impossible to feign
And no one made reply.
And angels know the rest.
From inns of molten blue.
When that old imperator, Death,
The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
That oceans are,
Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the April following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until this winter."
Yet that pathetic pendulum
Only the soldered mouth can tell;
XV.
The unsuspecting trees
   Unto the nearest town?
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
She laid her docile crescent down,
The bee is not afraid of me,
Between my finite eyes.
Into renown!
His strategy
It's like the woods,
Whose sandals touch the town, —
   Proud little heart!
The dusk drew earlier in,
While, chiefest of the crowd,
Just a look at the horses —
And then, to go to sleep;
And bowed and sang again.
We paused before a house that seemed
Drink, and are gone.
Day rattles, too,
My poignant luxury
In using wore away,
Upon the window-pane
Or would they go on aching still
ALMOST!
To lash the magic creature
An azure depth, a wordless tune,
Henceforth her only one.
And later, in August it may be,
And clerks in counting-rooms observe,
Of mountain and of plain, —
Was needless, as at sacrament
If recollecting were forgetting,
The grass does not appear afraid;
Invisible, as music,
The other peep
When we are going home.
And why not this, if they?
What opulence the more
Where he is floorless, yet of fear
   So short a thing to sigh;
   A brief campaign of sting and sweet
And kiss the hills for me, just once;
Bolder to fly away,
For we must ride to the Judgment,
   When nature's laugh is done, —
MAY-FLOWER.
The neighbors rustle in and out,
The pretty people in the woods
   Upon my silver shelf.
Supports me like imperial drams
Her voice among the aisles
COCOON.
   Reflex holiday.
Aforetime in my hat,
And somebody has lost the face
I went to thank her,
Within its hope, though yet ungrasped
I could not miss an ear,
THE LOST JEWEL.
Did stagger pitiful.
It would suffice my prayer
Some industry must be,
The Revelations of the book
Unknown, refreshing things;
The leaves, like women, interchange
The spirit and the dust.
Like intermittent plush were heard
I 'm finite, I can't see.
Contempt of generations,
Stiller than the fields
The will of its Inquisitor,
That phraseless melody
Taken from men this morning,
   Could not obtain for me.
And leave the soul alone.
   Enlightening misery.
   Ashore at last!
The realm of you.
Beneath the village door,
The thought is quiet as a flake, —
   Of those that stand alone,
Who cannot thank them, for the ice
'T is beggars banquets best define;
For it would stop my breath,
With her extremity,
Adown the empty street.
How would your own begin?
But if there were a Jason,
Retrospection is prospect's half,
My lifetime folding up
   The walls began to tell;
Till I take vaster attitudes,
Lead the wandering sails.
Remorse is memory awake,
My little craft was lost!
And cherubim and seraphim
It paints my simple spirit
Stranded, through discipline,
   Beside your twinkling door.
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;
As sure as flocks go home at night
   A worm his utmost goal.
The rose did caper on her cheek,
No man he seemed to know;
Empowered with what malevolence
Except the dying; this to us
As hopelessly as I,
And then, that we have followed them
   Saved for your ear when lutes be old.
High from the earth I heard a bird;
Yet strangest, heavier since it went,
Taught me by Time, — the lower way,
But let a splinter swerve,
My business, — just a life I left,
The wind pursued the little bush,
   Remembered but by me.
A something in a summer's noon, —
And our new hands
Oft a head is crested
Quick! a sharper rustling!
   That makes no show for dawn
'T was such a gallant, gallant sea
His helmet is of gold;
Never such an ambuscade
Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
Whatever prank betides!
Eternity enables the endeavoring
How many the fictitious shores
Of indigo and brown.
As an evening west
Her fingers fumbled at her work, —
That scalds me now, that scalds me now.
Be its pillow round;
   Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,
Paid all that life had earned
And only the waves reply.
If certain, when this life was out,
JOY IN DEATH.
   Be so, ashamed of thee.
REAL RICHES.
That passed, an hour ago.
    So, Saviour, crucify.
   No station in the day?
Then drop the paste,
I envy seas whereon he rides,
For this new value in the soul,
Good-by to the life I used to live,
   As heaven, unto me!
He bit an angle-worm in halves
Remit as yet no grace,
The gentian weaves her fringes,
Our life, his porcelain,
Than an earl's distinguished face;
Upon the waters borne,
   It almost speaks to me.
Our feet reluctant led.
The lady just unrolled.
In human nature's west!
Impatient of no child,
At news that he ceased human nature
I should not dare to leave my friend,
All day, among the crowded air,
   Why Paradise defer,
Rowing in Eden!
The bees will not forget the tune
I'm wife! stop there!
   Residing in a jar.
If I were as tall as they?
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, —
Her pretty speech, like drunken men,
   Where, keeping house for thee,
Between our feet and day!
   The stillness round my form
   In passing Calvary,
To vanquish other blooms.
SIGHT.
And if I do, when morning comes,
Mine by the right of the white election!
He doubtless did his best;
   Forever intervene!
And noon should burn,
All overgrown by cunning moss,
It slipped and slipped,
Unto supremest name,
Now know I they both visited
Let no pebble smile,
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush
To go without the spectre's aid
And visit only where I liked,
   And put it in a drawer, —
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
Angels, twice descending,
See where it hurt me, — that 's enough, —
   Myself his noon could bring,
Not any voice denotes it here,
For transport it be sure.
Of bronze and blaze
   When I am, long ago,
Then quivered out of decimals
RETURNING.
There's something quieter than sleep
WHO?
Of the separated people
    Had importuned to see!
Stirs the culprit, — Life!
The flying tidings whirled.
And when I was not heeding
The hands still hug the tardy glass;
Their faces upon God.
Softened by Time's consummate plush,
So busy was she, finishing,
And life is over there
   He is new and high;
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear,
Pleiad its name, and robin,
    By withes of supple blue?
A flower superfluous blown;
Here a mist, and there a mist,
Two worlds, like audiences, disperse
A route of evanescence
Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H." must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th September, 1884, she wrote:—
   Throughout a Christian land.
'T is whiter than an Indian pipe,
That, fading from your vase,
Or gold, who am the Prince of Mines;
   A service like a drum
One might depart at option
As of brier and leaf displayed
Or any cheek at nightfall
Of immortality
And whether, could they choose between,
IN SHADOW.
There must be guests in Eden;
    In her imperial round,
When you have done, pray tell me,
The low grass loaded with the dew,
Inviting to
This being comfort, then
New fingers stir the sod;
   Our statures touch the skies.
Comprised in prayer.
And row in nowhere all day long,
Whether to isles enchanted
Before the ice is in the pools,
Presuming me to be a mouse
When Orient has been outgrown,
I'll fetch thee brooks
So leisurely were we!
   I think it that "new life!"
As a church remain;
'T was sunset all the day.
But tens have won an all.
   My mind was going numb.
Love is anterior to life,
MY CRICKET.
ALONG THE POTOMAC.
LIII.
The minister goes stiffly in
A flying attitude.
As lady from her door
We ask that we may be.
Not like the dew did she return
SIMPLICITY.
At her low gate;
First page of Renunciation Second page of Renunciation Third page of Renunciation Fourth page of Renunciation
What once was heaven, is zenith now.
   From steeples in my soul!
The saved will tell
The breaking of the day
A long, long sleep, a famous sleep
And all the dead lie down;
Nor definitely what it was,
Its distance to behold!
The body grows outside, —
Upon my ankle, — then my shoes
   On his British sky.
The more convenient way, —
After dinner light for flowers,
A breeze
Edited by two of her friends
   Time never did assuage;
MINE.
   Like morning glory
   When I forget to tease,
Wonderful rotation
Disdaining men and oxygen,
Must seek the neighboring life!
Beneath his tabernacles play,
   Our periods may lie,
Was never blown away.
The quiet ages picked it up,
Upon a shining sea, —
The soul should stand in awe.
Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling —
Defeat whets victory, they say;
All forests, stintless stars,
Again.
On the bleakness of my lot
Two bodies therefore be;
Whether my bark went down at sea,
And still the pensive spring returns,
Still states, to dates that have forgot,
Grand go the years in the crescent above them;
She turns as long away
Obedient to her eye,
Felt feebly for her crown, —
Where the place called morning lies!
   To take the pumpkins in.
After playing Crown!
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,
The waters wrecked the sky,
Till those two troubled little clocks
By people of degree,
THE CHARIOT.
   Have lain their missiles by.
Lest I should be old-fashioned,
And flower that zealous blew,
Nor any coursers like a page
As blind men learn the sun;
The seasons fit the same,
At our stupidity,
On Pizarro's shore?
The cherubim withdrew;
A window opens like a pod,
And life and I keep even.
I found the phrase to every thought
Whose pencil, here and there,
That wearing on your breast,
And that 's the skies!
Too costly for repairs.
Haunted by native lands, the while,
The thunder hurried slow;
Laying her spotted face, to die;
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
The surreptitious scion
Without a tighter breathing,
   Bride of the Holy Ghost!
The moon was but a chin of gold
Have I the lip of the flamingo
To reach
We estimate our prize,
ASTRA CASTRA.
   To universe, or me,
A too presumptuous psalm.
Her little figure at the gate
   To punctuate the wall,
Give balm to giants,
   May seize upon his mind,
Facts, centuries before,
I felt siroccos crawl, —
Prithee, my pretty housewives!
   Whom none but daisies know.
We brethren are," he said.
Could we stand with that old Moses
My flowers from a hundred cribs
Or priests adjust the symbols
With gay delays he goes
To lives that thought their worshipping
The flesh surrendered, cancelled,
The siren Alps,
His conversation seldom,
To know if he was patient, part content,
Meant nought but going home.
   Will arrive to me!
But just for one to stipulate,
At morning in a truffled hut
And blotted out the mills!
   You and I, to-night!
That overflows the noon
Begins to live
Thine enemy;
And dip your fingers in the frost:
In search of something, as it seemed,
Talked softly of new species
Upon his dateless fame
Oh, bells that in the steeples be,
And he — he followed close behind;
Retreat was out of hope, —
   I envy speechless hills
And yet it will be done
Crackling with fever, they essay;
There knits a bolder one
Forgive us, if as days decline,
Then, bending from the sky
The palate of the hate departs;
PROBLEMS.
   Nods from the seconds slim,
For it would split his heart to know it,
PROOF.
You see, God bless his suddenness,
And summon them to drink.
   Could bounty but remain
I turn my brimming eyes away,
Of summer's circumspect.
As if some caravan of sound
The lightning skipped like mice;
And took himself for pay.
It powders all the wood,
Though his surpassing merit
And now, before the door,
Nor any death, but lest
Around its forehead bound.
Have you got a brook in your little heart,
THE RAT.
   Remember, as thou flee,
With badinage divine;
The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes,—life and love and death. That "irresistible needle-touch," as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power. This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.
How the old mountains drip with sunset,
Meadows of majesty concedes
Will idle lie, in Auburn, —
Perusal to facilitate
Where this is said to be
The meadows mine, the mountains mine, —
   Or chase me if I do,
Become so wondrous dear,
Behind the hill, the house behind, —
Or brooches, when the Emperor
To have it intermit;
I'd wind the months in balls,
* * *
Still rears the East her amber flag,
A little weather-worn,
   And no man visit me,
Till we are stouter;
Love, by memorial mould;
And ask my business there.
New weary sleep below;
Or the most agonizing spy
Is all the rest I knew!
Before the seal!
   And tell your cedar floor.
Futile the winds
Some lose their way.
Delayed till she had ceased to know,
I think just how my shape will rise
Done with the chart.
And then, if it should be
Some sailor, skirting foreign shores,
   That just now dangled still.
And might o'erwhelm me so!
Our faith to regulate.
I keep it staying at home,
   Has never been employed
Run round and round a room
After a hundred years
A day when it was not.
The lady dare not lift her veil
That they have done expecting me,
Until the daffodil
I breathed enough to learn the trick,
   To that ethereal throng
The slow archangel's syllables
Was dressed in mechlin, — so;
Agony, that enacted there,
Of ballads and of bards.
To lose thee, sweeter than to gain
That comprehendeth me
How better than a gem!
   It made us all ashamed
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!
How pleased they were at what you said;
Winds of summer fields
Had nature an Iscariot,
None buy it any more.
A lady white within the field
Depreciate the vision;
And they will differ, if they do,
A quality of loss
   Have summer's leave to be,
I shall not live in vain.
Or only I too small?
To the ecstasy.
Is it brought from famous countries
Why joys so scantily disburse,
There 's something in their attitude
From a superior bush.
A WORD.
       Before the school-boy
   A woman white to be,
Strange that the feet so precious charged
There came a purple creature
   In just a country town.
   The exponent of breath.
A witchcraft yieldeth me.
The entering takes away.
Parting is all we know of heaven,
   And then he spied a breeze,
The morns are meeker than they were,
The hours slid fast, as hours will,
Vast, in its fading ratio,
I've got an arrow here;
THE FUNERAL.
Where men made hay, then struggling hard
He hurts a little, though.
With my granite lip!
Step lofty; for this name is told
More near.
Took up her simple wardrobe
The river could not drown;
Who sings the same, unheard,
   Was haughty and betrayed.
Far off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,
"Hush! Epigea wakens! —
The eagle's golden breakfast
Report was not to me.
Related somehow they may be, —
   Canaan denied, —
And trudging feet from school.
Bride of the Father and the Son,
In shanties by the sides of roads;
The forests galloped till they fell,
   Upon a sacrament.
He cheats as he enchants
   When frosts too sharp became,
In Nature's dining-room.
Enabled by his royal dress,
Many will doubtless ask me,
Then lightly as a reed
I wish I knew that woman's name,
Learned gem-tactics
That shall aurora be
Proportioned to his several dearth
Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison
As one should come to town
A BOOK.
        HELEN JACKSON.
Oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,
Elysium is as far as to
Weeds triumphant ranged,
Enabled of the eye,
But called the others clear,
Pigmy seraphs gone astray,
Dear March, how are you?
   Till mine too heavy grew,
Necromancer, landlord,
At the accustomed hour!
Full royal is his retinue,
   Is helped by the regret
Is every one I meet.
His notice sudden is.
GONE.
   Its other realm of sea;
By every broom and Bridget
A guest in this stupendous place,
Jehovah's countenance!
Glee! The great storm is over!
I shall not live in vain;
Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"
I dared not meet the daffodils,
   For his beloved need,
PSALM OF THE DAY.
    No eye could find the place;
Is of within;
Upon a foreign shore
OUT OF THE MORNING.
A timid thing to drop a life
As imperceptibly as grief
Associates or glows alone,
   Surpasses that of wine.
TWO WORLDS.
Than it eludes the hound.
And thus, without a wing,
Therefore, as one returned, I feel,
I waked, to find it first awake,
At the setting sun;
LOST JOY.
And that side of the haze.
"For beauty," I replied.
Because estates can be
   Perceives when you are gone.
I offer thee
VANISHED.
I could not bear the bees should come,
A spirit, how doth it accost?
   And certainly that one
There's a certain slant of light,
   When what we need is by,
Held fast in everlasting race
In gentle deference to me,
Except for angels, lone;
And estimate the pearl
     I've known
To hear an oriole sing
Fate slew him, but he did not drop;
For you know we do not mind our dress
   I lost it in the sand,
XXXVII.
And swung their frenzied hair.
Keeps pleading, "I don't know."
But were it told to me, to-day,
ALPINE GLOW.
The snow and he are intimate;
You may forget the warmth he gave,
What right had fields to arbitrate
   And now, removed from air,
Success is counted sweetest
Must tell!
And first pronounced "a fit."
   He, too, did fly away.
THE SPIRIT.
    Than another hue;
Unarmed if any meet her,
And mockery was still.
   How still the dancer lies,
An imperial affliction
Should have the face to die.
I laughed a wooden laugh
XXXV.
   Or has an easier size.
And groped delirious, for morn.
    And say how many dew;
For mine to look at when I liked, —
LOVE.
'T is not conferred by any,
Did the harebell loose her girdle
And frigates in the upper floor
Horizons straggled down.
XXXIV.
I hope I 'm ready for the worst,
   'T is a necessity.
I boldly answered; entered then
We barred the windows and the doors
The sun has got as far
The grave my little cottage is,
At least to know the worst is sweet.
Is finished using now,
The north begun to push,
   That ever mason hewed;
   And breaths were gathering sure
And then, reluctant, turn away
MELODIES UNHEARD.
And morn should beam,
Brave names of men
That could not stop to be a king,
Just girt me for the onset with eternity,
The little cage of 'Currer Bell,'
Presents upon a tree,
What fortitude the soul contains,
ESCAPE.
PARTING.
Insulting is the sun
Neither patriarch nor pussy,
   Of what astute abode,
Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and the "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,—appealing, indeed, to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.
Still is the bustle in the brook,
An almanac's aware.
But I shall never tell!
Made nature different.
   I learned its sweetness right.
   As if a duchess pass!
Beguiles the centuries of way!
To the immortal tune, —
Given in marriage unto thee,
Whose bleating ceases to repeat,
There's not a charge to me
At its own stable door.
A presence of departed acts
She bent her docile sails;
No eye hath seen and lived,
Him you chasten, that is he!
The blissful oriole.
And closer to the fire
When they take the knife!
To invest existence with a stately air,
Mixing fresher air.
That just abroad his window
My friend must be a bird,
   They would not encore death.
   Or violate a star.
From cocoon forth a butterfly
COMPENSATION.
The one the other will absorb,
For fear it be dispelled.
How well I knew the light before!
I've known her from an ample nation
When, duller than our dulness,
But if they only stay
It burned me in the night,
   Were such her silver will!
Except the heaven had come so near,
Too silver for a seam,
In casual simplicity.
He preached upon "breadth" till it argued him narrow, —
A "this way" beckons spaciously, —
Late, my acre of a rock
Of victors designate.
I. LIFE.
HUNGER.
Upon the village I perceived, —
   By contrast with the love.
Obtained my lodgings ere myself,
That bells should joyful ring to tell
What more the woman can, —
One day is there of the series
Enlightened to a larger pain
I could not fix the year,
   For every day is said
I tried to match it, seam by seam,
The heaven unexpected came,
Fingers denied the plucking,
A hurry in the breath,
Both went to see.
Have crawled too far?
When suddenly across the June
   I speculate no more.
Wisdom is more becoming viewed
I know a place where summer strives
   How trivial is life!'
Advances calm to her supreme,
Reckon the morning's flagons up,
   Upon her puzzled ear;
   But possible to earn
Still for my missing troubadour
Permitted to commune this time,
The divine intoxication
Oh, thou unknown renown
OLD-FASHIONED.
Is solemnest of industries
She each year leads her daisies back,
A passing universe put on;
And instead of tolling the bell for church,
Would seem to me the proper way
   Till, swollen with the sky,
CONTRAST.
Of their imperial conduct,
Did you leave Nature well?
To venerate the simple days
An everywhere of silver,
Withstands until the sweet assault
That could abash the little bird
When peace was far away;
I lived on dread; to those who know
   Within a hut of stone
Captivity is consciousness,
When everything that ticked has stopped,
On fence and roof and twig.
There is a shame of nobleness
Repose to typify.
The orchard sparkled like a Jew, —
Equally plausibly;
The clover-bells forgot.
Creation looking on.
Into the sea, in passing,
And through a riddle, at the last,
Tell him the page I didn't write;
"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS."
Before I got my eye put out,
And windows hanging low,
Sleep is the station grand
But this time consciously, of grace
A ditty of the street;
I have another trust."
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
AURORA.
Tell him I only said the syntax,
The gnat's supremacy
Flowed silver to the west,
When Plato was a certainty.
THE SECRET.
   A sequel stands beyond,
Obliterate the etchings
   I used to when a boy.
Her golden finger on her lip,
To an insulted sky,
'T is drama, if (hypothesis)
And then the pious form
Its doom is audible.
In every human soul.
The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue,
The door as sudden shut, and I,
   And never I mind the sea;
This, the signal woe!
That syllable whose faith
Was ratified this way.
CONSECRATION.
The conscience of us all
   No evidence gives he.
A member of the cloud.
The robins stand as thick to-day
So proud she was to die
Then knit, and passed
Before you thought of spring,
His is the halcyon table
An Indiaman — an Earl?
Could mortal lip divine
   That one, to be quite sure
It was a narrow time,
Oh, what an afternoon for heaven,
   As cool to speech as stone,
Bedecked with thee,
And neigh like Boanerges;
And sportsman is not bold.
   That night should be to thee
Wear nothing commoner than snow,
Extended hempen hands,
When I am occupied.
   That from you or me
Was ever idleness like this?
   'T is dimmer than a lace;
Present our meek escutcheon,
   We journey to the day,
Some keep the Sabbath going to church;
What first,
   In frantic melody!
We play at paste,
Her admonition mild
   Or diamonds, when I see
And you should live,
When winter shakes the door,
And I and silence some strange race,
Is slowly handed back,
'T is an instant's play,
   Comes up to face the skies,
One blessing had I, than the rest
This is the land the sunset washes,
I've seen a dying eye
THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.
Dear March, come in!
At least, it solaces to know
TWO VOYAGERS.
Or settled regions wild.
He never misses a degree;
   Powerless to unfold.
   Nature had left behind.
Impaled him on her fiercest stakes —
Degrades the dress I wear.
Say quick, that I may dower thee
   A fitting a despair.
But nature is a stranger yet;
Affords the sly presumption
Were toward eternity.
Least village boasts its blacksmith,
This is the sovereign anguish,
Apparently with no surprise
When figures show their royal front
We waited while she passed;
As ankles of a queen, —
VII.
Though never yet, in any port,
Augmented, sweet, a hundred fold
Not a mention, whose small pebble
Wait till in everlasting robes
   Posterior to death,
While I was gone, and I — too late —
And taste eternity.
'T is then we sigh for houses,
Was God so economical?
   Flit russetly away.
Christ will explain each separate anguish
   For fear to be a king.
She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking. She was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist in pretence.
She stung him, sapped his firm advance,
Of orchis in the pasture,
I could not die with you,
   What customs hath the air?
His presence is enchantment,
   Will glow like bright bouquet,
And place was where the presence was,
And hands beseeching thrown.
   Our only lullaby.
Water is taught by thirst;
Somewhere, in silence.
Could stretch to look at me.
Must awaken her.
Through which men reach
   I, lost, was passing by —
Complaining all the while
Unfair an immortality
The symbol of a word
The heroism we recite
The motions of the dipping birds,
Put gently up the evening bars,
   And we accost no more.
When men and boys, and larks and June
So we must keep apart,
My gypsy face transfigured now
THE RETURN.
   And let the fire through.
Or some elf's catacomb?
'T is true the drought is destitute,
Neither decree
If, haply, mine may be the drop
I fumbled at my nerve,
Counts his nectars — enters,
   Before the skaters go,
And birds take places overhead,
   To houses unperceived, —
   I gathered from his talk,
On this soldier's brow!
Lest back the awful door should spring,
Provided it do hopeless hang,
   Philosophies don't know,
His fingers, if he pass,
I asked no other thing,
Some say it is the spheres at play!
   Is summoned by the tides.
   We ignorant must be.
Delayed till in its vest of snow
But God on his repealless list
While the ages steal, —
   When excellence is dead;
Reeling, through endless summer days,
Grandfather of the days is he,
That makes the quick of woe!
For fear I spoil my shoe?
The dying need but little, dear, —
I more than once, at morn,
   For many an ardent year.
We outgrow love like other things
And independent as the sun,
   The dial life and him.
But how he set, I know not.
And scarce of diadems
Split the lark and you'll find the music,
The sun went out to work,
From us she wandered now a year,
And they 'll wilt, like men.
But the success was his, it seems,
My heart would wish it broke before,
It wears a sprig upon its breast,
Or stirring house below,
How still the bells in steeples stand,
To measure off another day
You try to touch the smile,
I started early, took my dog,
A black, as of a spectre's cloak,
   And will not tell its name.
The frost beheads it at its play
   The universe her shoe,
The doom's electric moccason
   To him whose mortal light,
The far theatricals of day
And flirt all day with buttercups,
And 't was like midnight, some,
Italy stands the other side,
And then the streets stood still.
   And oriole are done!
But proud in apparition,
Since then 't is centuries; but each
That shone above the fagot;
Of a tint so lustrous meek.
   Wrinkled any bay, —
And shouts for joy to nobody
Like children round a sire:
   To that abhorred abode
THE MUSHROOM.
So you could see what moved them so.
And touched the curious wine.
At rest his fingers are.
And sunrise grows so near
Are so superfluous cold,
With a suspicious air, —
One little boat o'erspent with gales
What we touch the hems of
THE MOUNTAIN.
He visited, still flitting;
And celestial women,
The red upon the hill
Or early task to do?
Strangles them.
The sparrow of your care.
SETTING SAIL.
I'm answered in a lonesome tone;
   And it were perjury!
A Tyrian light the village fills;
Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor!
   Although I heard them try!
And then, prodigious, step
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,
And on the other side
And much can go,
Till hair and eyes and timid head
God gave a loaf to every bird,
Behind this soft eclipse!
And then a livid claw.
He has hid his rare life
And kindly ask it in, —
'T is so much joy! 'T is so much joy!
Victory comes late,
It asked a crumb of me.
And shut the windows down so close
Till we are less afraid;
Were I with thee,
For privilege of sod and sun,
In those dim countries where they go:
   Yielded grape and maize.
I could not find a privacy
Thine the securest fold;
'T were blessed to have seen.
On this long storm the rainbow rose,
No brigadier throughout the year
'T was not so much as David had,
Clutched tight by greedy hands;
And bore her, struggling, blushing,
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
From spotted nooks, —
LII.
Might some one else so learned be,
Only scantly and selectly,
Or laces, or a travelling show,
By those who ne'er succeed.
Next time, the things to see
Morning is the place for dew,
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?
   In country far from here,
Tears open her imperial veins
The seasons must have turned
Men do not sham convulsion,
And narrow at the floor,
An April but begun.
The second time to me,
Batschia in the blanket red,
A few went out to help the brook,
Prove piercing earnest,
Permit a child to join,
Essential oils are wrung:
Thither I pilot thee, —
Too fair
And if he spoke, what name was best,
And, supercilious, peer
Because that fearing it so long
Then have I
The notice to the startled grass
   But murmuring of some
And chubby daffodil."
The breezes brought dejected lutes,
And sanctity are best.
   And night is coming down!
I left the place with all my might, —
It was as if a bobolink,
   Beneath the sun may find.
Lay this laurel on the one
Then draw my little letter forth
   Of the appalling trade,
A dew sufficed itself
And then reluctant turn,
   Puts minor streams to rest.
An hour behind the fleeting breath,
The one who bore him tottered in,
Set orderly, for burial,
That self were hell to me.
They 're centuries from that.
To a heart in port, —
     Then to tell.
FRIENDS.
   Riches are sad.
   To her desire seemed.
Nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,
Upon a planet's bound.
It's safer so.
I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;
So constant to its stolid trust,
   That never seats but one,
Can read without its glasses
Instinct picking up the key
As the fainting bee,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me
Just a drop!
And then the brake is still.
Repudiates the obligation,
They won't frown always, — some sweet day
And will at home and well.
I never lost as much but twice,
     A miracle for all!
TILL THE END.
   Now, do you doubt that your bird was true?
   The sedge stands next the sea,
The hosts of witness stand!
When winds go round and round in bands,
And set the sun,
And were you saved,
Like stone.
Much as formerly?
I had a daily bliss
It wraps it, rail by rail,
   At what is dread to me.
With water, in the country church,
And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates
Before the judgment-seat of God,
At any other period.
Touching the roof and tinting the barn,
While just a girl at school!
I felt a funeral in my brain,
   For such a foe as this!
Who knows?
Unfitted by an instant's grace
   We envy the despair
Till opposite I spied a cheek
The murmuring of bees has ceased;
The very nearest room,
For pang of jealousy.
    Endear the shore beyond.
Capacious as the sea,
I drop my heart, unshriven!
   Need the wiser tell?
And felt, 'how vast a destiny!
    Doubtful if it be crowned!
Too near thou art for seeking thee,
Without a stint, without a blame, —
THE MASTER.
The best vitality
As berry of a mountain bush
This latest leisure equal lulls
We have understood, for better
   A perished sun
I fitted to the latch
   Some call experience.
Was like the stillness in the air
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him
I am glad they did believe it
For interrupting tears
The smallest housewife in the grass,
With specimens of song,
Should startle most;
    Like petals from a rose,
   Not present on the year
    Sits shyly at his feet.
His labor is a chant,
   Of vanished dames and men!
That interrupts the morn
The lingering and the stain, I mean —
   And our departure take
PLAYMATES.
Nature rarer uses yellow
Or rhododendron worn.
They leap upon their silver feet
Existence's whole arc filled up
But they could gag the tick,
And never stops at all,
Would split, for size of me.
Her simple haunts beyond!
The fathoms they abide.
If Immortality unveil
Is easier to find
That we can show to-day?"
Nods from the gilded pointers,
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
   Thou notice us no more,
   Some one the sum could tell, —
But why compare?
His idleness a tune;
The Spirit turns away,
THE SNAKE.
The bells at distance called;
As if no soul the solstice passed
And now she turns her perfect face
How dare the robins sing,
   That our minds are hot.
   But not a remedy.
   Thy little plan to me,
To seem like perfidy.
Let me not mar that perfect dream
Know what the sapphire fellows do,
Too lifted for the scant degree
On miscellaneous enterprise
   By summer's gracious mien.
And is lost in balms!
'T was a small town,
Some drifts were moved away
The intuition of the news
Reaching late his flower,
   Death's single privacy,
And go to pieces on the stones
I heard recede the disappointed tide!
I mind me that of anguish sent,
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.
For 't is his institution, —
Or Nature, spending with herself
Those who read the same edition
When one turned smiling to the land.
And keeps the soul serene,
His separation from his rose
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
To look at her; how slowly
I dreaded that first robin so,
Like hindered rubies, or the light
Too rapt with frost
To subdue the bumble-bee!
Of 'Potosi' and the mines!
LVII.
It tossed and tossed, —
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
Rise solemn in the tree,
   How cool the bellows feels!
The complement of hell.
An unconcern so sovereign
The one the other will include
We follow thee until
To bask the centuries away
And her capacity.
Born everlasting now.
'T was so unlike the crumb
Loose the flood, you shall find it patent,
Convicted of itself.
   The nearer her they get.
How dreary to be somebody!
And situated softly
My sentiments to share.
There 's triumph of the finer mind
IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.
Underneath their fine incisions
And touch the pantomime himself.
How conscious consciousness could grow,
   Sped by an archer's bow.
And rumbles still, though torrid noons
   Rapid! That will do!
Transporting must the moment be,
But then I promised ne'er to tell;
The berry's cheek is plumper,
If such an outcast be,
Enacted upon earth, —
    Like a lover's words.
To Eden wandered in —
Not all pianos in the woods
And if I don't, the little Bird
Dare you see a soul at the white heat?
   In strong society.
   Is freely certified
Yet not too far to come at call,
Morns like these we parted;
Too imperceptible, at last,
   Is not a lonesome way,
O God, the other one!
THE GRASS.
   Salubrious hours are given,
A peace, as hemispheres at home, —
Their chivalry consumes,
A narrow fellow in the grass
My cocoon tightens, colors tease,
These are the days when birds come back,
Cannot excel decay;
There came a day at summer's full
    Were undefeated still?
The gales indeed were done;
For that last onset, when the king
This timid life of evidence
Where presence is denied them.
   That were the little load;
That hurried all abroad, —
Four have recovered the land;
This democrat is dressed,
To squirrels and to me.
Going to heaven! —
But differed in returning;
He flung a menace at the earth,
For fear their yellow gown
At that enthralling gallop
The grave was finished, but the spade
As we ride grand along.
   In matters ratified?
Dim as the border star, —
   No less bereaved to be
As he esteemed them trifles,
A raised, ethereal thing;
It 's early yet for spring;
There came one drop of giant rain,
"That must have been the sun!"
What service when we pause!
How still the riddle lies!
Salute and pass without a hint —
   And bells that boldly ring
REMORSE.
And leave me standing there.
As far as cannon dwell,
THE SOUL'S STORM.
So safer, guess, with just my soul
If I should die,
XXXVI.
   Or a disgrace.
And echoes, trains away,
Thy consecrated bread to break,
Will there really be a morning?
I deem that I with but a crumb
And yet by trades the size of these
   There was no malady.
From out my summer's eve;
'T was this on tables I had seen,
And an orchard for a dome.
Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
On this superior soil;
Courtiers quaint, in kingdoms,
I like to see it lap the miles,
His haughty, spangled hems,
Saves she all of that for sunsets, —
I heard a fly buzz when I died;
I think the hemlock likes to stand
A lady red upon the hill
Prayer is the little implement
Before their feet are cold.
Through what transporting anguish
Nor had I time to love; but since
That speechless from her nest
LVI.
Fluttering first, then firmer,
   And pounds were in the land,
And pass, escaped, to thee?
Except to some wide-wandering bee,
THE HEMLOCK.
And it is bells within.
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
Lawful as
   Upon an ether sea,
As take the tale for true
   A whole existence through.
There was a little figure plump
Had there been no sharp subtraction
I envy nests of sparrows
He put the belt around my life, —
With chrysoprase, inlaid.
   Into what carbonates.
It is as if a hundred drums
A memorial crumb.
My best was gone to sleep,
It might be famine all around,
But Calvary.
Chastened, as to the chapel,
Gone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,
LVIII.
'T is noon, my little maid, alas!
Mine, by the grave's repeal
I did not know the ample bread,
On whom the summer shone!
At bases of the trees, —
As far from pity as complaint,
Till my small library.
Though I get home how late, how late!
XXXI.
Her little rocking-chair to draw,
Our blank in scorning.
A deed knocks first at thought,
Red is the fire's common tint;
   Ho! pilot, ho!
Alas! that frowns could lie in wait
Belles from some lost summer day,
When Death lit all the shortness up,
Ah, curious friend,
To the lover bee,
When sense from spirit files away,
And the bridges often go.
Shadows hold their breath;
Soft sauntered through the village,
Death doubts it, argues from the ground.
Hint that within the riddle
I taste a liquor never brewed,
THE LOVERS.
When the meadows parching lie,
The moon slides down the stair
Has it feathers like a bird?
A brief, but patient illness,
I'd rather call him star!
Wills silence everywhere.
'T is dying, I am doing; but
The cavalry of woe.
So short way off it seems; and now,
Of one another's eyes.
And wrecks in peace a purple tar,
I moved my fingers off
Mortal my friend must be,
Musicians wrestle everywhere:
Antiquity.
By stretch of limb or stir of lid, —
   I hear the silver strife;
   To memory and me.
NOTE. — This poem may have had, like many others, a
   With rubies pelteth me;
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
It was a short procession, —
Several of nature's people
And the odd flambeaux no men carry
The sunshine threw his hat away,
Is all I own.
   And if they have to try,
   I trudge the day away,—
   To electricity.
SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
To tell him it is noon abroad, —
Before the fields have finished,
Until the bees, from clover rows
A minor nation celebrates
And showed their dimples, too.
Withheld the little child!
   To perish of delight.
And every blossom on the bush
The bell within the steeple wild
The deer invites no longer
Since that appalling day!
Of latitudes unknown.
IN VAIN.
But the least push of joy
I years had been from home,
And if to miss were merry,
Slow tramp the centuries,
And bathed them in the glee;
And I had no more eyes
For sordid excellence
'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand
The creatures chuckled on the roofs
Prepares your brittle substance
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;
And I a pauper go;
Annihilate a single clause,
The orchards spangles hung.
   Where was once a room,
   Such as these, are still.
XXXVIII.
'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, —
Pink, small, and punctual,
The forest of the dead.
   'T would crumble with the weight.
You left me boundaries of pain
   Her dimities of blue.
So shy, so very ignorant,
To meet an antique book,
Surfeit? When the daffodil
The color on the cruising cloud,
To stay the homesick, homesick feet
It has a garret also
Dips — evades — teases — deploys;
The mermaids in the basement
Who marshalled her away.
Whose fingers brush the sky,
   Be it but a play,
She leads him, docile as a boy,
Kept treading, treading, till it seemed
   Ourselves be not pursued.
No nearer, lest reality
Bars cannot conceal!
   The pod that Duty locks!
Before my simple bosom broke, —
Until to-morrow, — happy letter!
   This is a mighty room;
Not audible, as ours to us,
The birds and I had often shared
An ecstasy of parting
A summer afternoon, —
The broad are too broad to define;
   And I'm a rose!
And made the gables laugh.
Till love that was, and love too blest to be,
   As near yourself to-day
   Just saves it from despair,
Has it feet like water-lilies?
Instead of morning! Hadst thou broached
Except to heaven, she is nought;
REFUGE.
LOVE'S HUMILITY.
Almost a loneliness.
The purple territories
And of the butterfly
You left me, sweet, two legacies, —
THE BATTLE-FIELD.
To fight aloud is very brave,
   Upon a pile of wind
To a discerning eye;
   Trips frantic in a tree,
And I became alone.
We wondered at our blindness, —
Dwell timidly with thee!
It's past set down before the soul,
I might have chanced that way!
Our summer made her light escape
Against the wind is seen,
A narrow wind complains all day
That at the last it should not be
   And makes one lift one's hat,
There 's triumph in the room
Unbraiding in the sun, —
   There'll be that dark parade
And life would be all spring.
He wore no sandal on his foot,
Death sets a thing significant
Her progress by the bee proclaimed
As if it tarried always;
Or cool one pain,
I feel for them a transport
My hand, with trembling care,
In lonesome place.
   Out of reach of skill,
To eyelids in the sepulchre.
The grass so little has to do,
Met by the gods with banners
A neighbor and a warrior too,
REQUIEM.
Would not the jest
I know not which thy chamber is, —
   As these that twice befell.
   On solitary hills
   All other hearts I knew.
If, haply, thro' a dream to peep
But rapid, like the roe;
My noon had come, to dine;
But now, all ignorant of the length
Why, God would be content
And though I may not guess the kind
A sickness of this world it most occasions
I scanned the windows near;
Lest anybody spy the blood
Disdained them, from the sky,
SAVED!
Too tender to be told.
That is the manufacturing spot,
Time's sublimest target
Faith is a fine invention
Pass back and forth before my brain,
An enemy could send.
In the name of the bee
That nobody might know
Is possible
To seek for the accomplished guest, —
To lips long parching, next to mine,
POWER.
Wades so, through polar air.
   Now I am ready to go!
   Would be my final inch, —
Some things that stay there be, —
Then, punctual as a star,
So much that, did I meet the queen,
My country need not change her gown,
God preaches, — a noted clergyman, —
Ah! the sea!
He touched me, so I live to know
Discarded of the housewife,
So satisfied to go
Some burning noon go dry!
The stitches stopped themselves,
   His head, a cap and frill.
Upon her mat.
Those who read the Revelations
Gracious now to me as any,
   Into solitude! —
I said: "'T will keep."
Oftener by the claw of dragon
DEAD.
By means of it in God's ear;
Blown tremulous in glass.
And therefore good.
So hidden in her leaflets,
To-day her only boy
God keeps his oath to sparrows,
A wider sunrise in the dawn;
And bees as bustling go, —
A sphere of simple green,
The morning stars the treble led
November left; then clambered up
Who, had they lived, had died, but when
   I go no more away
By homely anguish strung.
Because your face
A light exists in spring
A death-blow is a life-blow to some
So quiet, oh, how quiet!
IMMORTALITY.
MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON
And fences fled away,
   I half indifferent viewed,
       Attempt by strategy.
How fair her conversation,
   Upon the slowest night.
Good night! which put the candle out?
Bears me along that way.
   Abrupt, mechanically;
Being just asleep,
A foe so reticent.
   And gurgled down and down.
That yours and mine should be,
A passage back, or two, to make
It waits upon the lawn;
Surrender is a sort unknown
Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,
THE SEA OF SUNSET.
She dropt as softly as a star
And Immortality.
Unto my books so good to turn
   Makes he forest dry;
    Of morning and the moor,
Hope is the thing with feathers
The show is not the show,
THE SNOW.
If tolling bell I ask the cause.
   And where was the wood,
It cannot be my spirit,
A THUNDER-STORM.
Odd secrets of the line to tell!
As children bid the guest good-night,
When I was carried by the farms, —
Alluded to no time
As soon impeach my crown!
Behind, a sealed route,
And now, what life or death can do
It was as if a chirping brook
In accidental power.
Is daily drunken there.
And gain the sky,
What dignified attendants,
But microscopes are prudent
It is as swans discarded you
The pedigree of honey
Peruse how infinite I am
III. NATURE.
THE LETTER.
No blossom stayed away
So seemed to choose my door,
FOLLOWING.
Upon her amber shoe.
Their costume, of a Sunday,
Of heaven above the firmest proof
Receives its annual reply.
How pomp surpassing ermine,
I wonder if it weighs like mine,
   A glass of water's all,
My paradise, the fame
SHIPWRECK.
LOST FAITH.
The opening of a door!
Just opposite, another speech
The angels, happening that way,
And yet abide the world!
Amid no bells nor bravos
Contending with the grass,
Entirely for me;
Too late for striving fingers
   And Being but an ear,
It could not hold a sigh, —
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
Its unobtrusive mass.
Or giddy bird in orchard,
By but twelve performed!
The only one forestalling mine,
The wondrous nearer drew;
The everlasting clocks
He stirred his velvet head
I have not quite the strength now
And do the little toils
All the rooms are full.
How many legions overcome?
His best Norwegian wines.
With ropes of sand
Portraits are to daily faces
That make the circuit of the rest,
   I, lost, was passing by, —
   No wedlock granted me.
Our journey had advanced;
Whose dying eyes no country
A throe upon the features
Redemption, brittle lady,
Alas! how heedless were the eyes
BY THE SEA.
The mountain at a given distance
Her everlasting fashion set,
XIII.
   Sometimes almost more.
   Just as the dusk was brown,
   And the discomfit mine.
   And then consolidates, —
'Father, thy will be done' to-day,
   Ecstatically leap, —
Clear strains of hymn
The sky!
But did not finish, — some way back,
It can't be dying, — it's too rouge, —
   Which bears a sword
The grass divides as with a comb,
   The morning it is new,
Arcturus is his other name, —
Immediately, that anguish stooped
"Dissolve," says Death. The Spirit, "Sir,
With last delight I own!
Would anybody care
A dominie in gray
His speech was like the push
Equilibrium.
Posterior, prophetic,
Was recently among us.
   As daisies now to be seen.
That those who know her, know her less
With implements to fly away,
It is the gift of screws.
And he passed quickly round!
The last and second time
Anemone and bell,
And yet, as poor as I
Bound to opposing lands.
   Your brain to bubble cool, —
And yet it tasted like them all;
I say it just
XVII.
WITH FLOWERS.
Somehow, it will be even,
Past what ourselves can estimate, —
Great streets of silence led away
Was that she might,
Of our old neighbor, God!
Till we are helped,
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies.
Had notched the place that pleased him, —
Competent to kill it,
Breaks up my feet,
They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
Convulsion playing round,
The eyes glaze once, and that is death.
A honey bears away
I should have been too saved, I see,
A vest that, like the bodice, danced
Could she a son contemn,
To lose one's faith surpasses
And know no other way.
And chatted close with this grand thing
Concluded and begun
And so, until delirious borne
And so I always bear the cup
For any golden fleece;
   He neutralized them all.
   That sense was breaking through.
Blue sea, wilt welcome me?
The stimulus there is
Betimes an oratorio,
East of eternity;
   The reason deeper lies, —
   We jest and shut the door;
The foreigner before he knocks
   Conviction every day, —
The purple brook within the breast
Is an imperial friend, —
   To gain it, men have shown
As from an emerald ghost;
And fretted in the eaves.
The angels must have spied,
Life's latitude leant over-full;
     Nor with a stone;
Bereaved of all, I went abroad,
Mine, while the ages steal!
On such a day?
Scan, like him, the stately landscape
   If thou would'st take it now.
   In one consummate bill,
In cups of artificial drowse
   The aster on the hill
Runs evenly and true;
I 've known permission given
Put on her carmine suit, —
And settled regions wild,
   The shaft that never knew,
In forest and the hill
That very instant passed.
Not any higher stands the grave
Yet take her from the lawn,
Known by the knoll,
Let go a music, as of tunes
   When you approach the place.
That if the spirit like to hide,
APOTHEOSIS.
An island in dishonored grass,
That bore another rose;
Where parties, phantom as herself,
   Too sullied for the hell
Can go, itself, without a fan
   To occupy.
ASPIRATION.
   And all we need of hell.
At the full dew,
This gave me that precarious gait
In lands I never saw, they say,
And morn a new politeness took,
He, waking, finds the flower near.
As children to the rainbow's scarf,
The heart I cherished in my own

Is Heaven a physician?
I lost a world the other day.
"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,
Without disclosing what it be,
Her pretty parasol was seen
So when 't was time to see,
She died, — this was the way she died;
UNWARNED.
Exultation is the going
Pray gather me, Anemone,
Then, how the fire ebbs like billows,
V.
Death is but one and comes but once,
Minutest of mankind might be.
Neglected son of genius,
   When 'Brontë' entered there!
Within my income these could lie,
Or a leaving home; or later,
What word had they for me?
I gained it so,
Brazil? He twirled a button,
Was grateful for the roses
A charm invests a face
Restraining rampant squirrel
   With tints of majesty,
And what a privilege to be
The day came slow, till five o'clock,
   To fail with land in sight,
I know the butterfly;
Was physiognomy.
A contrast to our respites.
    Oh, lagging yesterday!
   For, put them side by side,
With eyes in death still begging raised,
   Termed immortality.
And the children no further question,
For ampler coveting.
   And all the night ashine,
Or mists the Apennine.
And bees to entertain,
Since I could never find her
Induces my belief,
As 't were a tropic show.
Stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,
And yet how still the landscape stands,
And lo! her silver principle
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,
Where nature's temper cannot reach,
But her Carrara guide-post, —
Than all the golden presence
Too plummetless that it come back
   And she had hearkened him.
Denying they have been.
A very few, a bird or two,
And dwell a little everywhere,
And then, if we are true to plan,
Inspiriting habiliments
   And guile is where it goes.
    And I, no other prayer.
Before were cities, but between,
   Her visitor no more.
    They speak of what we owe;
The porter of my father's lodge
   I thought how it would be
   A fisherman's degree!
   The village lies to-day.
I did not love enough.
   Why swagger then?
Oh, if there may departing be
The morning fluttered, staggered,
   As the attempt to rise.
And still the punctual snow!

THE JUGGLER OF DAY.
   Did round my pillow roll,
Remembrance has a rear and front, —
The brain is wider than the sky,
Whether by day abducted,
If summer were an axiom,
The thoughtful grave encloses, —
And when this mournful ditty,
Unto such, were such assembly,
But only to himself is known
Take care, for God is here,
Yet certain am I of the spot
Obsequious angels wait!
Oh sea, look graciously!
To tell your name the livelong day
   Must not criticise
   His musket on his breast;
A word is dead
The daisy follows soft the sun,
Upon an arc of white.
Behold the keenest marksman!
   Drill silently for heaven.
And carts went stooping round the fields
It can't be summer, — that got through;
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow, —
Balking our wit
GOING.
With infinite affection
It was the limit of my dream,
Defeat means nothing but defeat,
Then they will hasten to the door
   The dust in streets goes down,
Surrendering the last,
Who built this little Alban house
One mitred afternoon.
Feather by feather, on the plain
Between the bliss and me.
Henceforth for her what holiday!
Somebody flings a mattress out, —
    Whose anvil's even din
    Its quivering substance plays
Then, glancing narrow at the wall,
The Alps neglect their curtains,
   I open every door;
   It had the tassels on.
That such a day, permitted so,
GOSSIP.
   A cycle, it may be,
I thought that storm was brief, —
   Then I am ready to go!
Come back, and dust the pond!
A TEMPEST.
And wear, if God should count me fit,
'Tis harder knowing it is due,
Circumference between.
My labor, and my leisure too,
   Then take my flower, pray!
She went as quiet as the dew
Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane;
At last to be identified!
Nor noticed that the ebbing day
My neighbor be.
EMANCIPATION.
   But their competeless show
Imps in eager caucus
To sing unto the stone
In little wealths, — as girls could boast, —
And life hath immortality.
Until the North evoked it.
I 'm sure 't is India all day
And fleeter than a tare.
Acquaintance, just a few,
       Lest it fall,
Beloved, only afternoon
   I often wonder he
Past bows and invitations,
I, softly plucking,
The broadest land that grows
The last night that she lived,
GRIEFS.
'T were easier for you
Thou stirrest earthquake in the South,
I pray you stroll once more!
Without a single leaf,
But we stood whispering in the house,
Who has not found the heaven below
The royal scar hast thou?
Yet that whip's name too noble
XXXIII.
If nature will not tell the tale
    Among astonished boughs;
And cooling tamarind.
If I should stab the patient faith
"And I for truth, — the two are one;
With thoughts that make for peace.
'T was the new liquor, —
Thy music still when whippoorwill
The Caspian has its realms of sand,
The only raiment I should need,
Your consciousness and me.
Into the lap of adamant,
Her rusty ammunition
But just a crumb to me;
From house to house 't was noon.
Is Heaven an exchequer?
A something in a summer's day,
Until it puzzled came
He lived where dreams were sown.
Which solemnizes me.
'T was such a greedy, greedy wave
No drearier can prevail!
SUMMER'S ARMIES.
   Their anchors fast;
An easy morning's ride.
The night was wide, and furnished scant
   Go down the fields to hay!
Oh, housewife in the evening west,
A sloop of amber slips away
Propitiate this democrat
A diadem to fit a dome
To Nowhere seemed to go
Some distant heaven,
Our share of morning,
Almost thy plausibility
   This, and my heart beside,
Angels in the early morning
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended —
What if I say I shall not wait?
Of resurrection? Is the east
Sweet debt of Life, — each night to owe,
   Vanquished, my soul will know,
Have ventured all upon a throw;
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
   Fructified in sand.
His larder — terse and militant —
And a green chill upon the heat
With such severity,
Nor that his frame was dust.
   Afforded royally.
Who took the flag to-day
The murmur of a bee
He questioned softly why I failed?
An aged bee addressed us,
Extinguished in its sea.
That taunts her bayonet.
Immortal Alps look down,
    Night's possibility!
He scanned their trinkets, curious,
THE CONTRACT.
Reminded me of mine,
Set bleeding feet to minuets
BECLOUDED.
Where the maids?
It wrinkled, and was gone.
The wind does, working like a hand
But no man moved me till the tide
It quivered through the grass,
Would anybody sigh
Had nature any outcast face,
The chiefest apprehension
Unbroken forehead from the east
As other creatures that have eyes,
Far ends of tired days;
In a satin vest.
Dispelled from there;
If the foolish call them 'flowers,'
In bright detachment stand.
He danced along the dingy days,
When earth cannot be had;
You'll know it by the row of stars
THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.
Their coming mentioned be.
The brooks brag all the day;
The neighbors do not yet suspect!
The brooks laugh louder when I come,
   Before its emblem flew.
A wisdom without face or name,
   From the early sum,
The sceptic showeth me;
And deem ourself a fool.
Summer for thee grant I may be
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;
I could not see it now.
The general rose decays;
The sun kept setting, setting still;
   To con thee o'er and o'er,
And newer fashions blow,
Then stills its artisans like ghosts,
These are the days when skies put on
The lily waiting to be wed,
THE WOODPECKER.
Just a dome of abyss is nodding
Except a perished creature
II.
HOPE.
TRIUMPHANT.
Putting up
South winds jostle them,
   The most accomplished shot!
Besides, the deepest cellar
In one or more existences
That mushroom, — it is him.
Seems it, to my hooded thinking,
    Passing pomposity?
The want of diadems!
   Termed mortality!
   Might yet reply!
Each one salutes me as he goes,
Why, I will lend until just then,
The bodiless begun;
When nothing was to see
Blazing in gold and quenching in purple,
       The heaven we chase
   And that by right that he
And the sermon is never long;
Oh, sacrament of summer days,
The bobolink was there,
And God at every gate.
And then you and I were silenter.
Later by just an hour than death, —
The sweeping up the heart,
Land, ho! Eternity!
The emperor will say.
How high
THE FIRST LESSON.
    The debauchee of dews!
Will no one guide a little boat
And if forgetting, recollecting,
Expressed or still;
   Should disenthrall thy soul.
On revelation's wall.
As if the resurrection
For an approving God.
With will to choose or to reject.
The distance that the dead have gone
The splendor of a Burmah,
   A fashionless delight
THE TULIP.
Of early hurt, if such a lapse
   Than knowing it is here.
   Is it too large for you?
    Can summon every face.
My life closed twice before its close;
And workmen finished, one by one,
Is where the angels are.
A dim capacity for wings
To miss it beggars so.
Sequestered afternoon.
Repeal the beating ground.
REAL.
I could have touched!
Morn is supposed to be,
They'd judge us — how?
The carriage held but just ourselves
Is not so ample as the breast
"Perhaps they did not hear," I said;
Put me in on the firmest side,
Taste thine immortal wine!
The literature of old;
Yet why so little sound myself
What soft, cherubic creatures
   I will forget the light.
   That bears a human soul!
May be seen the dews among,
Departing like a pageant
I will not be pursued!
No dew upon the grass,
A loosened spirit brings!
   The figures hunched with pain,
Stands symbol for the finer forge
And sigh for lack of heaven, — but not
   Loving the hand that sent it,
A flower's unobtrusive face
And yet, my primer suits me so
Of me, himself was shy;
Have never passed her haunted house,
Antiquest felt at noon
Or the earl an earl?
The gem was gone;
If just as soon as breath is out
And what a wave must be.
   Affecting our content,
That short, potential stir
And could not breathe without a key;
Let down the bars, O Death!
Earring, or stone,
Like neighbor from another world
Should reach the heart that wanted me;
   For he is grasped of God.
The thunder crumbled like a stuff —
It is not bird, it has no nest;
MY ROSE.
When it began, or if there were
It would be life,
XXX.
Then cloudier become;
Dissuade thee if I could not, sweet,
Hurries a timid leaf!
I meant to find her when I came;
Came out to look at me,
   I have a missing friend, —
To countenances new!
To lives that stoop to notice mine
   It passes, and we stay:
Heavenly hurt it gives us;
It cannot be again.
And a company — our pleasure
I could not tell the date of mine,
XX.
An instinct for the hoar, the bald,
Clasped yet to him and me.
   But something held my will.
To bear them orchestra,
News is he of all the others;
Myself a poorer prove
   Frail little heart!
MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.
Sweet hours have perished here;
Had been legible to me.
THE WIFE.
   Like balls upon a floor.
Great Spirit, give to me
We passed the setting sun.
And now, I'm different from before,
Nor noticed night did soft descend
Are you nobody, too?
Has sated flame's conditions,
If 't was a meaner size,
But just the names of gems, —
To learn the transport by the pain,
There 's that long town of white to cross
The lightning's jointed road,
   I know I heard the corn,
But just to hear the grace depart
On their passage Cashmere;
And now you 've littered all the East
And drew the head erect;
But then,
These are the visions baffled Guido;
My childhood, and the string of spools
To those who look on you
But, March, forgive me —
   Till the ball is full, —
I never hear of prisons broad
Fair play —
Recordless, but for them.
   And anchor off the bar,—
At the drowsiest?
It was a boundless place to me,
THE BEE.
   Or billows like a shore?
Delight becomes pictorial
Practising sands.
To dare.
Her unanointed forehead
Passed out of record
Develops pearl and weed,
   Nodding in navies nevermore.
His countenance a billow,
For shops would stare, that I,
To all the lists of clay!
The stars the trinkets at her belt,
I offered him a crumb,
He ate and drank the precious words,
There's grief of want, and grief of cold, —
They may take the trifle
And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
Went up from the Potomac,
The peace, the flight, the amethyst,
    Ah! friend, you little knew
   Since Yorkshire hills are green,
   Do lowlier appear;
   And it's partly down hill.
Partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us
III.
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
And all we said was "Saved"!
That such have lived, certificate
How many trips the tortoise makes,
This humble tourist rose.
What interested scholars most,
   Belief but once can be;
THIRST.
So clear, of victory,
   Nor simplified her ghost.
One in the red array, —
To have a smile for mine each day,
And struggles in the lanes,
   The apple on the tree,
Nor action new,
Falter? When the sun
Presents a claim invisible,
And revery.
Then I said softly to myself,
Three weeks passed since I had seen her, —
XLVIII.
Her God her only throng.
   For death was that, and this is thee.
We like March, his shoes are purple,
Sweet morning, when I over-sleep,
And I condemned to be
Makes summer when the lady lies
Or what the distant say
The cornice but a mound.
   The interdicted ground
Menagerie to me
A spotted shaft is seen;
How hospitable, then, the face
Creation seemed a mighty crack
   The children hurry by;
Cheerful, as to the village,
Just his sigh, accented,
We must an anguish pay
   In a New England town!
   For the one ship that struts the shore
FORGOTTEN.
So preconcerted with itself,
Had I, a humble maiden,
Or is entombed so still
   So I shall never fall;
The vane a little to the east
The mighty merchant smiled.
So sure I 'd come — so sure I 'd come,
So breathless till I passed her,
And scooped a turnpike for themselves,
Still had it such a value
As lowly spices gone to sleep,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
I thought just how red apples wedged
When time's brief masquerade was done,
And life was not so ample I
Nature forswears
A goal,
Eternity by term.
Was but a book. What liberty
I have no life but this,
Her glory I should know:
Busy needles, and spools of thread,
Since that my Lord, "the Lord of lords"
I wonder how the rich may feel, —
Or flag subsist, or fame export
And make itself so fine, —
It 's sharpest of the theme
Her eye unto the summer dew
Was it a pleasant day to die,
Which if they do not fit for earth
   The north, to-night!
And one upon the rack.
To-morrow, night will come again,
   Of prancing poetry.
Except that you, than he
After a life, a death we'll say, —
I'd brush the summer by
   Correctly, yet to me
   And when Thanksgiving came,
   She reached the asphodel!
A snake is summer's treason,
None will.
When the rivers overflow,
That lit the drummer from the camp
To — no one that you know!
And wonder we could care
Departed to the judgment,
Magnanimous of bird
In keen and quivering ratio
To rejoin its own.
Some rainbow coming from the fair!
The wardrobe of our Lord.
How excellent the heaven,
'T is a fond ambush,
I was wont to see,
   I do not understand!
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
Lips unused to thee,
Was large enough for me.
   And creak across my soul
That will not state its sting.
   It feels so old a pain.
And "You're hurt" exclaim!
If ruff it was of dame
The maimed may pause and breathe,
Only to fail again!
So unsuspected violets
And broke against my ear.
Bumblebees come,
To note the fashions of the cross,
For gentlemen who see;
Is shunned, we must admit it,
If I should bribe the little bird,
I.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
Can stand so close and look so bold
"'T is daisy in the shortest;
For interview had come;
   And I omit to pray,
The clouds were gaunt and few;
That often as a cloud it met
They bear no other errand,
Orchard, and buttercup, and bird —
To see who's there.
The birds jocoser sung;
That dies away in dimples
   Not to partake thy passion, my humility.
To meet so enabled a man!
And kingdoms, like the orchard,
    MABEL LOOMIS TODD.
The soul selects her own society,
To me shows insecure.
   A being has the same;
For mine, I tell you that my heart
Pain has an element of blank;
Nor fire, for just my marble feet
From all the jails the boys and girls
   I would not break thee:
Upon the mortal side.
Poured thee without a stint.
My second rank, too small the first,
That not a Santa Claus could reach
I make my parlor orderly,
   The bolt upon the door,
Because you saturated sight,
As laces just reveal the surge,
Without the fear to justify, —
It's all I have to bring to-day,
On stump and stack and stem, —
Fled gasping from the house.
    To see that none is due?
Rang loudest
And peace was Paradise!
No universe, no laws.
Is aristocracy.
Superfluous were the sun
So choosing but a gown
But children on the Don
'T was a long parting, but the time
I could not,
Whose wandering is done.
Make this bed with awe;
WEDDED.
The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
Supposed they visited remote,
Some touch it and some kiss it,
A thought went up my mind to-day
Transcending ecstasy.
And still within a summer's night
   That was in the green,
There, — sandals for the barefoot;
Than those of organdy,
Leaping like leopards to the sky,
Acquitted from that naked bar,
I'll tell you how the sun rose, —
Edited by
Drifts were as difficult then to think
Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
   That the acorn there
God's residence is next to mine,
Than when the cricket came,
   Remains to him unknown:
I made my soul familiar
   'T is the vermin's will.
O'erlooking a superior spectre
There was no purple suitable,
Spending scarlet like a woman,
A menace at the sky.
Exhibiting to these.
   That I my thoughts may dim;
Who knows but this surrendered face
   But human nature feels.
The hills just tell the orchards —
As children caper when they wake,
   In quiet Haworth laid.
   The son of ecstasy.
Shone closer by.
   And this mechanic stone
If pride shall be in Paradise
Duties of gossamer,
When but a little child, —
Which, sir, are you, and which am I,
But never met this fellow,
FORBIDDEN FRUIT.
That what we cherished, so unknown
For whom I robbed the dingle,
ROUGE ET NOIR.
Upon an August day?
Not exorcised before,
Accessible to thill of bee,
A further force of life
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Their hock and sherry draw,
The colors of the commonest;
All this, and more, if I should tell,
Our blank in bliss to fill,
I had rather wear her grace
Then put their nightgowns on.
No blackbird bates his jargoning
And satisfies an awe
Was dying as he thought, or different;
Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
It has no future but itself,
XLIII.
Yet know I how the heather looks,
Than this great purchaser suspect,
The name they dropped upon my face
It was too late for man,
But epoch had no basis here,
I never spoke with God,
Entreat us tenderly
He comes just so far toward the town,
And softly through the altered air
XLI.
One clover, and a bee,
And I tip — drunken.
   The day went out to play,
THE GOAL.
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
Second Series
That I might have the sky
And I choose — just a throne.
Grant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
Then bubbled slow away.
   The same amounts remain.
Beneficent, believe me,
Conduct the pleasing scene!
Building where schoolboy dare not look
So thick upon the plain?"
In deference to him
   Menacing the tree,
At supper of the Lamb.
Would the bee the harebell hallow
It makes the parting tranquil
   With analytic eyes;
Sharp pittances of years,
Nor implement was seen,
   Into the purple well,
A sudden expectation,
I many times thought peace had come,
And the juggler of day is gone!
The daily own of Love
There's banishment from native eyes,
Meet — and the junction be Eternity?
A joyous-going fellow
   But positive, as sound.
When I shall be forgiven,
Life, and Death, and Giants
And come next hour to look.
   For arrogance of them.
Enamour in prospective,
And left the verb and the pronoun out.
XXIII.
We cover thee, sweet face.
Whose coat of elemental brown
Three times, 't is said, a sinking man
Then veil my too inspecting face,
There came a wind like a bugle;
For each ecstatic instant
Pray do not ask me how, —
Raffle for my soul.
The mornings blossom into noons,
   Which in the clover dwell.
   I sat me down to sigh.
On deserts, in the sky,
The blond assassin passes on,
   By an auroral stain,
Except for winds, provincial;
The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones, everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong. The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date, the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy.
   Who sang full many a day,
   That hovered there awhile.
No hue of afternoon
   Where none of us should be,
'T was later when the summer went
Of independent hues,
And sings the tune without the words,
We noticed smallest things, —
Let no sunrise' yellow noise
He kindly stopped for me;
If it contain a kernel?
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,
The wagons quickened on the streets,
Of your viands and your wines!
Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying:
   At that grand 'Right hand'!
Are friends delight or pain?
SUCCESS.
Undue significance a starving man attaches
And when the hills are full,
"Their bed-time 't is," she said;
POSSESSION.
ENOUGH.
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Know how to starve!
To wander now is my abode;
Then, turning from them, reverent,
In murmuring platoon!
At first repeat it slow!
But they that go.
Where for the night
Unmeaning now, to me,
Tradition suffer me
The news like squirrels ran.
   Her hallowed mystery.
Night after night her purple traffic
I have a king who does not speak;
And just a bit of "crown;"
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
The glimmering frontier
My flowers raise their pretty lips,
    That I could spell the prayer
Not one of all the purple host
I 'm knocking everywhere.
And when his golden walk is done,
Awaited their low brows;
   Or intimates it there;
Stars, amid profound Galaxies,
XLV.
   A hubbub as of feet;
   Than the meadow mild,
Stare vacant into mine
Then quiver down, with tufts of tune
Meanwhile, her wheeling king
So instead of getting to heaven at last,
You, unsuspecting, wear me too —
   While, like a guard between,
XI.
Anecdotes of air in dungeons
You took it all with you.
A train went through a burial gate,
And God forbid I look behind
It might have been the lighthouse spark
One need not be a chamber to be haunted,
THE SUN'S WOOING.
The past is such a curious creature,
Without the sterile perquisite
A modest lot, a fame petite,
   It grew as I pursued,
And softly pick its lock.
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,
Itself its sovereign, of itself
Early aged, and often cold, —
XIX.
DAWN.
Could make assignable, — and then
You have passed enfranchised feet!
   The judgment perished, too.
Or wind's bright signal to the ear,
The bystanders will tell!
     Because it flies!
That any gain.
For entertaining plated wares
And shiver for the poor,
The sun, as common, went abroad,
Farther in summer than the birds,
Or what Circassian land?
The grave would hinder me,
To our penurious eyes!
The birds rose smiling in their nests,
It will not stir for doctors,
   Without oppress of toll;
Or whether it be none,
Are nothing to the bee;
By faith is overcome.
Too intrinsic for renown.
ROUGE GAGNE.
DESIRE.
   Acknowledged him a man.
A floor too cool for corn.
   Themselves should come to me.
In purposeless circumference,
Who counts the wampum of the night,
We talked between the rooms,
To those in heaven now.
We thirst at first, — 't is Nature's act;
"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here?"
Or shroud of gnome,
A ribbon at a time.
And push it with my fingers next,
   Oh, thou celestial host!
A whip, so small you could not see it.
Merchantmen poise upon horizons,
Morning has not occurred!
I hope the father in the skies
   Of that waylaying light.
It lay unmentioned, as the sea
But how shall finished creatures
Who are these below?
SURRENDER.
   Than I reviled myself
They wonder if It died on that, —
   Subsists till Paradise.
For that was thine before;
The brother of the universe
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!
   To the parish night;
   While cool, concernless No
Some manner of the hair, —
And time should gurgle on,
And then the windows failed, and then
And then I go the furthest off
My prayer away I threw;
But angels say, on yesterday,
   Of immortality
Doubtless we should deem superfluous
He never had but one;
Tankard, or spoon,
Our feet were almost come
Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?
   And art thou sleeping yet?
Where midnight frosts had lain!
At such and such a time.
Whether she met with gales,
And yet its whole career
While simple-hearted neighbors
Fulfilling absolute decree
   On a summer's day;
CHOICE.
The reticent volcano keeps
Beautiful as pictures
That woman and her boy
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
Can human nature not survive
Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,
Then I had counted it until
   The chemist may repay,
DREAMS.
   Drop Gabriel and me.
The bobolinks begun.
Forty gone down together
How good to be safe in tombs,
   Were nothing very odd!
As it passed my window
One with the banner gay,
And handled with a chain.
My river waits reply.
Who never wanted, — maddest joy
No ornament but palms.
Is more distinctly seen, —
A duchess were too common
And then a quarry pare
   So slow and cautiously;
THE SLEEPING FLOWERS.
   I had not strength to hold.
   Unto the thought before,
And many hurt;
Now it is night in nest and kennel,
So keep your secret, Father!
Can I expound the skies?
No daybreak can bestir;
Everywhere alone
I got your letter, and the birds';
Much sense the starkest madness.
   First time together thrown.
When heaven looked upon us all
What will the fir-tree say?
The prudent carries a revolver,
For his civility.
Themselves forsake contented,
   And covenant gentians frill,
'T was such an ample peace,
That is solemn we have ended, —
On a strange mob of panting trees,
Than oars divide the ocean,
I said, but just to be a bee
But I tug childish at my bars, —
A bird came down the walk:
That any brook is there;
I'm Czar, I'm woman now:
   Respect the grayest pile
   Dukes for setting sun!
XLII.
If the savans 'classify' them,
     Thou puzzlest me!
Till qualified for pearl,
THE BALLOON.
If I should fail, what poverty!
At window and at door.
Remembered as the mile
I had been hungry all the years;
VI.
It hurls its barbed syllables,—
   All interspersed with weed,
Without design, that I could trace,
Present them here!
Mine enemy is growing old, —
That I shall love alway,
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
I woke and chid my honest fingers, —
At length the notice came.
Noons like these she rose,
Bent to the water, shivered scarce,
Who fall, and none observe,
   Her annual secret keeps;
At half-past four, experiment
The most unworthy flower.
With clasps of chrysolite.
She sweeps with many-colored brooms,
Of the elder dead.
So whether it be rune,
But I would not exchange the bolt
The soul that asked its shelter
Except as a surmise,
Or only a divine.
We passed the school where children played,
And when they all were seated,
   And how I just said 'please.'
What one broke off with
But Nature lost the date of this,
    Truly yours,
   For immortality.
You dropped a purple ravelling in,
I knew no more of want or cold,
   Remained in memory.
One eye upon the heaven renounced
That made the pellet mine, —
On my homesick eye,
Have not each one of us the right
And then an awful leisure was,
And split their pods of flame.
The jury voted him.
Too sound asleep did lie
   Will reward the hand;
The leaves unhooked themselves from trees
By catching at the twigs that grow
That went to help the sea.
   For beggar, or for cat.
There seemed a purple stile
Where it rose, or whither it rushes,
And he, unmoved, regarded her,
EXCLUSION.
   Within my loving creed.
Superiority to fate
And went to sleep.
   Within this inner room!
Not in this world to see his face
   When men and women hear
   In placid lily sleeps!
Till everlasting life unite
And of the breeze, amen!
The frosts were her condition;
XXIV.
What ailed so smart a little maid
I tried to drop it in the crowd,
   Upon a plane of gauze!
The humming-birds aspire.
Of numerous humming-birds at once
Lest that should conquer me;
It intimates the finer want,
For heaven is a different thing
Not pursued by learnèd angels
That "God have mercy" on the soul
To take it.
Nor rend with scymitar.
My story has a moral:
The wrinkles of the road.
Till when they reached the other side,
And then we knelt in prayer.
Their countenances bland
   No fear you'll miss the road.
That stiffens quietly to quartz,
SUMMER SHOWER.
As all the heavens were a bell,
His laughter like the breeze
Yield such an alcohol!
   Can nightingale be seen.
   'T were Thanksgiving day.
   Till the houses blot;
And mists are carved away, —
"I will inquire again.
If any would avenge, —
To think of answering you!
Lethargic pools resume the whir
In chrysoprase apartments hung,
   The likest I have known.
This sums the apparatus
And yet we knew that gentle clock
    Who spun the breadths of blue!
As children, swindled for the first,
   There interposed a fly,
The bone that has no marrow;
A stately, shriven company;
In that immortal copy
For every little knoll,
Seed of palm by Lybian sun
But not an hour more!
To her fair repose.
And thrum upon the door,
   When best men die;
I said I gained it, —
"Which in the valleys lie?"
The twilight stood as strangers do
   The bee, dost thou forget?
However true their show;
Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
   A hateful, hard, successful face,
   I envy spokes of wheels
Is large as thine.
Pompless no life can pass away;
Baffle, if it cost you
   The stubble's joints between;
A solemn thing it was, I said,
Felicity or doom.
   But the remotest star!
Then, if it have burrowed
And prayer,
   Or that ethereal zone
   How near I had forgot!
The cautious grave exposes,
Not easy to surprise!
And anguish absolute,
Some, too fragile for winter winds,
A furtive look you know as well,
   That scalps your naked soul.
Needs but to remember
And carried it to God.
It beckons and it baffles;
And then together bore away
And rivers where the houses ran
The beads upon the forehead
That kept so many warm.
And maelstrom in the sea;
One will walk to-day!
Brought out their burrs and mosses
Stop — docile and omnipotent —
And "station" and the rest!
To their temerity.
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
And then 't was put among the dust
They spurn the air as 't were too mean
The date, and manner of the shame;
A paradise, the host,
And spices, and the dew,
   Who tight in dungeons are.
His knowledge to unfold
Or even a report of land
An awful tempest mashed the air,
Such dimity convictions,
The thimble weighed too heavy,
Humming the quaintest lullaby
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.
That perches in the soul,
The sun proceeds unmoved
SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.
'T was just this time last year I died.
Myself felt ill and odd,
No stature has it, like a fog,
Might I but moor
Titled, confirmed, — delirious charter!
And I esteemed all poverty,
XXVI.
Making that homely and severe,
Myself distinguished God.
That science cannot overtake,
   To discourse alone;
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
There is no frigate like a book
Was savory.
When, night descending, dumb and dark,
A something so transporting bright,
A toad can die of light!
And men that made the hay,
A wounded deer leaps highest,
Indebtedness to oxygen
The busy darling lay,
And past my apron and my belt,
It 's far, far treasure to surmise,
She slept beneath a tree
My splendors are menagerie;
Who 'll let me out some gala day,
What sorcery had snow?
Computes the stamens in a breath,
    The homelier time behind.
   Poor little heart!
Do the blue havens by the hand
When March is scarcely on.
That I could fear a door,
To lead it here;
The butterfly's assumption-gown,
THE WlND'S VISIT.
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;
Propounded but a single term
       This was all.
Into Van Diemen's land.
To him seems misery.
I met one, — forgot my school-mates,
Your inference therefrom!
THE PREACHER.
Nor simulate a throe.
The morning, happy thing,
   Is heaven then so sad?
Was all the one that fell.
And exigencies never fears;
   That day.
And pain is missed in praise.
Slipped quiet from its chair,
To touch,
   We men and women die!
Land, by the oceans passed;
And she pours soft refrains
Nor visited in heaven;
That hunger was a way
"Whose are the little beds," I asked,
Than when the winter came,
Transplanted to the road.
   I may remember him!
The brain has corridors surpassing
Experienced, who can pass
   Or brushed a royal gown;
I would not choose a book to know
My little circuit would have shamed
Your riches taught me poverty.
Blew out itself for fear.
Ah, bugle, by my window,
Sent us of the air.
   To the native land.
But not the obligation
How mighty 't was, to stay
If I can ease one life the aching,
I felt his silver heel
The tidy breezes with their brooms
But just the primer to a life
Her bonnet is the firmament,
His breast, a single onyx
No ruddy fires on the hearth,
Depart, before the host has slid
Like one in danger; cautious,
How dim it sounds!
The feeblest or the waywardest, —
   With every morning's beam.
Leaving a new necessity, —
Industrious until
Question if his glory
Cherries suit robins;
   Is culpabler than shame.
His bill an auger is,
His small umbrella, quaintly halved,
Is the egg of forests
If, haply, any say to me,
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.
In it wait till judgment break
His gait was soundless, like the bird,
   Just as the dawn was red,
From a convenient grass,
Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
   Where the storm is o'er?
   To get away from you, —
I gave myself to him,
Not death; for who is he?
That toddled down the bay!
       Ah! the bee flies not
But this, in lady's drawer,
Spectre cannot harm,
And blue, beloved air —
Can such a foot explore
The faithful witness,
Or porch of gnome,
The truth never flaunted a sign.
   As women do their gown,
Lest anybody find;
And yet we guessed it not;
Incautious of the sun.
   A crash without a sound;
I dare not eat it, though I starve, —
    I 'm not a party to.
    Patient till paradise,
   For, hold them, blue to blue,
   The happy, happy leaves
   For creatures so renowned.
   He stuns you by degrees,
   Is Immortality.
   Can pierce an armed man.
Screams chanticleer,
Of last year's sundered tune.
   It be not tragedy!
I'm feeling for the air;
It is not of the bird
Near kinsman to herself,
I wonder if they bore it long,
They cannot take us any more, —
Won't be new-fashioned when I come,
A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is
Betrays the solitude.
[Published in "A Masque of Poets"
   That prison doesn't keep.
Upon the polar hem,
fellow-townswoman and friend.]
Auto-da-fe and judgment
At half-past three a single bird
Half glad when it is night and sleep,
' T is the seal, despair, —
Of which I have never heard?
And uniforms of snow.
   Has simultaneous come, —
Of the first league out from land?
Then stepped straight through the firmament
When we with daisies lie,
Tell him just how the fingers hurried,
Though all the rest are here, —
Step lightly on this narrow spot!
By traveller is heard,
"Unto the little, unto me,"
   It blistered in my dream;
I have elected one.
And Nicodemus' mystery
The gilded creature strains and spins,
Sounds long, until I read the place
In its extremest clause, —
Tranquil, as to repose,
Within its precincts hopes have played, —
Might I but be the Jew!
Than one of higher temperature
As by the dead we love to sit,
The thought beneath so slight a film
When April woods are red."
Our bashful feet.
Yield her moat of pearl,
   That 'heaven' is, to me.
But so adjust my daily night
LOST.
   Let every babbler be.
But holiday excludes the night,
And then adjusted his little notes,
In such a shining place!
But gallanter, I know,
How they will tell the shipwreck
Some pilgrim thirst to slake, —
The maple's loom is red.
Severer triumph, by himself
   On patriotic day,
His quaint opinions to inspect,
A jealousy for her arose
For frigid hour of mind.
   Wedlock of will decay;
   It was before!
TIME'S LESSON.
When bumble-bees in solemn flight
Then, like a timid man,
   As doth the meadow-bee,
The summer's empty room,
   Whose Genesis is June.
But then I am a rural man,
For passing Calvary.
I 've heard it in the chillest land,
   Gay little heart!
BEQUEST.
An hour to prepare;
An anodyne so sweet,
As were they old acquaintances, —
   Supremest earthly sum.
Though my name
   Sweep vale, and hill, and tree!
Conjectured, and waked sudden in,
Round her chamber hums,
He knew no more that he was poor,
Attireth that it hear
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?
NUMEN LUMEN.
    To purer reveille!
Old Nicodemus' phantom
Lost, in the sepulchre.
   One Pleiad was its name,
By frigate or by merchantman,
   Jehovah told to her,
And — waking long before the dawn —
If then He hear,
Some say that bright majority
That one so honest be extant
But I was twice as bold.
   Or better, run away
STORM.
"Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him —
As Paradise.
By clocks 't was morning, and for night
INVISIBLE.
     Because it dies!
By and by the boldest stole out of his covert,
Shall meet the eye of traitor
I aimed my pebble, but myself
If anybody sneer,
I felt a clearing in my mind
If any ask me why,
   Until we meet a snake;
O'ertook by blast,
The morning foreign shone, —
New periods of pain.
THE MARTYRS.
THE SEA.
It's such a common glory,
So pretty, so ashamed!
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
A little road not made of man,
Unless we dine on tip-toe.
The Maker's cordial visage,
Beguiling thus the wonder,
Time brought me other robins, —
We might look for him;
   Could give them any pause;
Please to tell a little pilgrim
sent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty
The living looked that day.
A best disgrace a brave man feels,
THE HUMMING-BIRD.
The day that I shall go,
He traverses familiar,
   How many I espy
When turning, hungry, lone,
Carolled and mused and carolled,
Butterflies pause
Lock the door!
There is its noiseless onset,
Her lips of amber never part;
FIRE.
Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less
I reason, earth is short,
As much of noon as I could take
Contrasting which, my qualities
That image satisfies.
The dusk kept dropping, dropping still;
We shall not want to use again
The shopman importunes it,
It half endears the abstinence,
Bisected now by bleaker griefs,
A careless snatch, a ballad,
I bring thee the imperial heart
   Continual crowning me.
God permits industrious angels
The dead shall go in white.
His future a dispute;
Would pierce me with a fashion
   That it will come again.
Nor constellation burn,
But trifles look so trivial
THE SPIDER.
The accent of a coming foot,
Who win, and nations do not see,
Bells, also, in the village,
So notelessly are made!
   It wasted from my sight,
Third Series
Another on the roof;
This merit hath the worst, —
   So easy to repair.
That's all.
And get the dimples ready,
To such, if they should whisper
Hast thou no arm for me?
It is a faded meat.
But medicine posthumous
Immortal is an ample word
   Or shy of troubling her.
Lest I should insufficient prove
Some vision of the world Cashmere
AFTERMATH.
We only know what time of year
The angels labored diligent;
   To stealthily belong?
Without the formula of sound,
"'T is iris, sir, and aster,
   The tranquiller to die;
As ever in the sky.
Who never lost, are unprepared
Royalty enough for me
Unto the saints' slow diligence
   Obscured with ruddier hue.
   Did they forget thee?
Whose farthest of degree
If in that room a friend await
But that thyself fatigue of us;
As flavors cheer retarded guests
To races nurtured in the dark; —
Each that we lose takes part of us;
Till summer folds her miracle
Our panting ankle barely gained
Grant that repentance solemn
What mystery pervades a well!
As the third sycamore.
Of persons outside windows,
Prohibits him,
It might be easier
    Is unavailable.
As numb to revelation
If bees are few.
Flutter too far for me.
And rested on a beam;
Requires sorest need.
Great Britain disapproves "the stars;"
To think just how the fire will burn,
   It shows the furthest tree
Read, sweet, how others strove,
A sailor's business is the shore,
   For fear I hear her say
They 'd banish us, you know.
And ate the fellow, raw.
The mountain sat upon the plain
   And strut upon my stem,
The moon is distant from the sea,
   Upon a raft of air,
Be horror's least.
I looked for you before.
But when the woods were painted
To pity those that know her not
So drunk, he disavows it
RENUNCIATION.
Paris could not lay the fold
And blame the scanty love
Ring the tree and leave it, —
The aptitude to fly,
Will entertain the centuries
PHILOSOPHY.
'T were easier to die
THE STORM.
Mine by the royal seal!
To his adroit Creator
Of their unthinking drums.
A pleader, a dissembler,
DYING.
THE COMING OF NIGHT.
To continents of summer,
An added strut in chanticleer;
Thy windy will to bear!
If anybody's friend be dead,
Feels shorter than the day
Triumph may be of several kinds.
Time is a test of trouble,
That leaves this neighbor out.
God calls home the angels promptly
Sparrows unnoticed by the Father;
As if the chart were given.
   Among the cunning cells,
   Some thousands — on the cause
My departing blossoms
Over the stile of pearl!
Few get enough, — enough is one;
   To make me visible.
This dusty heart espied;
Upon a new peninsula, —
I know it by the numb look
It never did betray
When Sappho was a living girl,
THE MOON.
The seasons prayed around his knees,
These are the western mystery!
   We more than half suspect,
In the fair schoolroom of the sky.
That not a beggar would accept,
And I, could I stand by
I measure every grief I meet
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
My residence within
Afflicts me with a double loss;
And I had put away
Angels when the sun is hottest
Which in a perturbation
And yet your little draught of life
Where every bird is bold to go,
The attar from the rose
THE MONUMENT.
And all those hills
The wealthy fly upon his pane,
Only the chemist can disclose
MEMORIALS.
I had a crimson robin
To the same pageant wends its way
Wherefore, O summer's day?
   Oh, what a livid boon!
To die of thirst, suspecting
And stand upon their heads!
That I have had before,
The only ghost I ever saw
Frequently the hills undress
But that negotiation
Past the houses, past the headlands,
The morning after death
   In sight of native air.
Would put out Jesus',
How many bullets bearest?
Old ones crack.
   Though pyramids decay,
There, — gathered from the gales,
Their lessons scarcely done;
Is numb and vital-less.
Still fable, in the isles of spice,
Stooping as low as the otter's window,
Before the door of God!
But she slept;
A fellow in the skies
Of cordiality;
Lift, if you can, the listless hair;
Reimbursed my store.
FRINGED GENTIAN.
Sealed are the spicy valves;
The day was warm, and winds were prosy;
How condescending to descend,
That you were coming, — I declare,
And shouts fill all my childish sky,
Revisiting the bog!
Into deep eternity!
   It had been heaven below.
We trust that she was willing, —
He likes a boggy acre,
The lower metres of the year,
It may be wilderness without,
None may teach it anything,
The happy winds their timbrels took;
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
Whose fingers string the stalactite,
I struggled, and was there.
Hid heaven and earth from view.
I'd rather suit my foot
Frequently are brown;
   The proudest trees.
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
A finer shame of ecstasy
   I take thee by the hand.
For an alighting mine.
I confidently see!
It just reminded me — 't was all —
Whose bonnets touch the firmament,
Till sudden I perceived it stir, —
They storm the earth and stun the air,
The whole of me, forever,
   Before the Christmas tree,
Than save my boot,
Unto my seeming make?
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,
A heaven in a gaze,
At the lone orthography
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, —
Whereas I took the butterfly
And subterfuge is done;
Than an interior confronting
And this linnet flew!
No brimming tankards flow.
That when I could not find it
   For heroes than for men;
And struggle slacker, but to prove,
Knowest thou the shore
   Upon a sea of blond;
    Dim, long-expectant eyes,
   A third event to me,
Ah, what sagacity perished here!
An ecstasy in chief;
And he unrolled his feathers
Meek at whose everlasting feet
I will not name it in the street,
Addeth to my degree;
I thought if I could only live
It ruffles wrists of posts,
As flakes of snow stood yesterday,
If I could see you in a year,
Where it used to be.
Down which on either hand
Strews the landing with opal bales;
A courteous, yet harrowing grace,
'T is little I could care for pearls
That other kind was pain;
The liberty to die.
I'd count them on my hand,
The wind tapped like a tired man,
The shapes, though, were similar,
The privilege.
''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;
And then I started too.
   So, when she comes this way,
Anger as soon as fed is dead;
In odors so divine,
What if I burst the fleshly gate
Be sure you count, should I forget, —
His character a tonic,
   To take us lands away,
To-night in thee!
   That they proclaim.
When it comes, the landscape listens,
Of tribulation these are they
'T was not thy wont to hinder so, —
Our interview was transient,—
"The bumble-bees will wake them
   Like fallow article,
Forbidden fruit a flavor has
    AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,
For firm conviction of a mouse
Pervaded her, we thought
   Must thrust the tears away.
I 'm used to that.
Doth not retract a single spice
Lathed with down.
May be seen the sands among,
   And sow my blossoms o'er!
Out upon the bay.
The mail from Tunis, probably,
Again he tapped — 't was flurriedly —
   No Caspian could be.
At Deity's decree.
XXVIII.
I wished the grass would hurry,
And that defies me, — as a hand
Her needle would not go;
If birds should build as early,
Calls forth this spectral canticle,
   We fundamental know,
It then goes out an act,
   A horror so refined
To take the measure of the house.
Can blaze be done in cochineal,
Fell, they will say, in 'skirmish'!
But peers beyond her mesh,
I know that he exists
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
   And blaze the butterflies!
   For Deity.
The one that could repeat the summer day
And not a song pervades his lips,
As wrecked men deem they sight the land
Or dome of worm,
It sounded as if the streets were running,
   As sinews do, with age.
   To keep the dark away.
   Like an adversity.
With shrill felicity
Bees' exclusive coterie.
   Their seam the day upon.
Never the treasures in her nest
On Revolution Day?
   And wealth, and company.
And the earth, they tell me,
   On time's first afternoon!
Called to my full, the crescent dropped,
    We nearer steal to Thee, —
A color stands abroad
A SYLLABLE.
   The beggar and his queen;
It flings a crystal veil
   By physiognomy.
   Upon this summer's day
Eternity's white flag before,
So faces on two decks look back,
   That on her lisping piled.
   His countenance to see,
Who knows but she would tell?
Glow plain and foreign
I live with him, I hear his voice,
How loyally at parting
    With hammer and with blaze,
Thy sacred emblems to partake,
Experiment to me
And make much blunder, if at last
Adjusts its tumbled head, —
IN A LIBRARY.
The grass so little has to do, —
The lungs are stirless, must descend
We learn in the retreating
Ample make this bed.
And butterflies desire;
In just the dress his century wore;
The earrings of Pizarro
   Some chafe its idle hand;
   If love inquire, 'Where?'
   Gethsemane can tell
Bashful, sip thy jasmines,
   Desire's perfect goal,
Enlarged beyond my utmost scope,
I had a star in heaven;
'T was sooner when the cricket went
Oh, for a bee's experience
Stands the sun so close and mighty
   As if my trade were bone.
Other betrothal shall dissolve,
at the request of "H.H.," the author's
But when the south wind stirs the pools
Nature was in her beryl apron,
The clovers understood.
It puzzled me to know,
To guess it puzzles scholars;
It was not death, for I stood up,
   Of a dependent brood;
   With purple load will hang;
For each beloved hour
So I must baffle at the hint
A quietness distilled,
And they can put it with my dolls,
The stones achase,
That commerce will continue,
And though the skies are crowded,
Her public is the noon,
Ah! the bewildering thread!
THE ORIOLE.
   And badinage partook,
   Parting with a world
A bird broke forth and sang,
He never heard that fleshless chant
A flippant fly upon the pane;
At any fair.
Who is the landlord?
That there exists a gold,
   Will fail of it above.
The rose will redden in the bog,
   Unto my frugal eye,
To keep it from effacing
And were you lost, I would be,
A dog's belated feet
   And marry whom I may,
And what itself will say to me,
And that pale sustenance,
And I 'm accustomed to him grown, —
   I heard it hit the ground,
Hover, hesitate,
And signed the fete away.
   With beclouded eyes!
At last, the lamps upon thy side,
I held a jewel in my fingers
XII.
Doth like a bubble antedate,
Whole pools of it, —
Until we met the solid town,
Of earl and midge
I live with him, I see his face;
The figures I have seen
The crocus stirs her lids,
To crew and you;
LOVE'S BAPTISM.
Have I the art to say.
DEED.
On what concerns our mutual mind,
Unto the shepherd's arm!
Perhaps a squirrel may remain,
   To make an even sum.
Occasionally rides;
To any happy flower,
   Please God, shall ascertain!
I know some lonely houses off the road
FROM THE CHRYSALIS.
EVENING.
I just wear my wings,
It has a simple gravity
APOCALYPSE.
   But, when her worst was done,
His spirit grew robust;
EPITAPH.
   A soul had gone to heaven,
But internal difference
Or too impetuous bird.
On this wondrous sea,
On the look of death.
Deliberate, as a duke would do
Look, how I clutch it,
I never saw a moor,
The distant strains of triumph
Eclipse was all we could see at the window,
   Would it blur the Christmas glee,
   Is a soul 'forgot'!
I envy light that wakes him,
Contented, known, before
His name remain.
   Remark that birds have fled!
Like that old measure in the boughs,
Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,
"Who's there?"
So civic as the jay.
Her bodice rose and fell,
Without external sound,
I, from agony!
That was all!
The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;
Reviewed it with my eyes,
   Contented as despair.
And be of buttercups the friend
If father'd multiply the plates
She's dreaming of the woods."
   Transport, by throe;
That life like this is endless,
If I may have it when it's dead
Her bed a funnelled stone,
   With their dear retrospect.
XXXIX.
A pittance at a time,
This bird, observing others,
Too jostled were our souls to speak,
It struck me every day
Without a glance my way:
   Grant that we may stand,
THE WIND.
Invests so mean a brow!
Then at the feet of the old horizon
And waltzed above a stream,
He bolts the door,
   Confronting us again!
It's like the light, —
He glanced with rapid eyes
       It hung so high,
The smitten rock that gushes,
MOTHER NATURE.
On seas of daffodil,
XVIII.
Defeat, an outgrown anguish,
Confided are his projects pink
When I was small, a woman died.
Yet, never, in extremity,
   Like costumes grandsires wore.
For visitor, or sundown;
Hope is a subtle glutton;
Till weights will hang.
You dropped an amber thread;
EXPERIENCE.
Of an inland soul to sea, —
PRAYER.
Angels, write "Promoted"
But overlooked my father's house,
When I hoped I feared,
   Would be a daily thing,
   As if the house were his,
That rambles in the road alone,
So I, the undivine abode
Were challenging despair.
   I rose, — it followed me;
    Extinguished, now, for you!
   A dateless melody.
A prank nobody knew but them,
CHARLOTTE BRONTË'S GRAVE.
Of woman and of wife.
As if a kingdom cared!
The pillow of this daring head
   On the other side, —
   That if the heaven inquire,
When viewed through pain, —
   Be judgment what it may.
LIX.
But, till the merchant buy,
'T is lost, and lost to me.
You may have met him, — did you not,
I cannot live with you,
A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
Such as content, and heaven;
A monster with a glass
Also, who laid the rainbow's piers,
Much madness is divinest sense
Each life converges to some centre
I'm not afraid to know.
Had power to mangle me.
Bold little beauty,
THE SHOW.
Along appointed sands.
If you should get there first,
Many's the gallant, overwhelmed creature
And easy sweeps of sky.
Into the beautiful.
That other state;
But this involves the grave.
Am sovereign of them all.
One hand the tools,
Will lift his little girl, —
When that which is and that which was
The solemn Alps,
I only sigh, — no vehicle
But bliss is sold just once;
   Was nearer than the sky,
Yet a druidic difference
How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,
This covert have all the children
   I learned, in leafy wood
He will not be obliged to wait,
I meant to have but modest needs,
Was that confiding prodigal,
By soldiers battered down,
   Sagacity must go.
Their coming back seems possible
Nor heedless by the way
Her providence the sun,
LONGING.
   Had almost made it dear.
I thank these kinsmen of the shelf;
Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;
Death is the common right
The mushroom is the elf of plants,
For chanticleer to wake it, —
Or noon in mazarin?
But she and Death, acquainted,
One more "Ye Blessed" to be told;
Things overlooked before,
Your breath has time to straighten,
Tenderly took it up from toil
They'll recollect how cold I looked,
Material place.
And failed, and all the summer laughed.
Is that great water in the west
Her final summer was it,
I read my sentence steadily,
Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
WHY?
   Their old forefathers sang.
   I should not fear the fight.
Developed from within, —
   With ease, and you beside.
What is forbidden utterly
   Chat of the 'early dead,'
   I will contented be;
Receive me cordially.
Might he know
You've seen balloons set, haven't you?
And afternoon, and butterfly,
LIFE'S TRADES.
And we, we placed the hair,
Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
But never I mind the bridges,
Was such still dwelling there?
God made a little gentian;
Wonder upon wonder
And of "truth" until it proclaimed him a liar, —
And I have ceased to wonder why;
Refining these impatient ores
I meant to tell her how I longed
Retire to other latitudes,
Far from love the Heavenly Father
And wishfulness in me arose
   Glimmer on the spot!
Of robins in the trundle bed
But his seraphic self!
Were greater than itself, though he
Ages beneath the mould.
Her busy foot she plied,
The sun just touched the morning;
And started all abroad;
NOVEMBER.
Their feet upon temptation,
   Everything in life.
We can find no scar,
   Wherever roams the day,
Pathetic from the grass,
How many colors taken
But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies
   But could not make them fit.
   So distant to alarms, —
Each bound the other's crucifix,
For his decamping wants.
I hear the level bee:
The eagle of his nest
How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel
And so the walls don't tell,
Is bliss, then, such abyss
His feet are shod with gauze,
For yet to buy another pair
To shut the other's gaze down, —
A travelling flake of snow
Far as the east from even,
To some superior tree
   Myself can hold the key.
   Describing in the air
My nosegays are for captives;
"No, sir! In thee!"
That ever rocked a child.
Like flowers that heard the tale of dews,
How warm they were on such a day:
No squirrel went abroad;
Scantily dealt to the summer morning,
Inviolable compact
Not knowing when the dawn will come
Old-fashioned eyes,
   Sagacious confidence;
Look too expensive?
'T was best imperfect, as it was;
You cannot put a fire out;
   I dissect the play;
Doubt me, my dim companion!
Adrift! A little boat adrift!
   Have settled with the year! —
Has anybody found?
An altered look about the hills;
Talk with prudence to a beggar
   Does not at first appear;
Till, his best step approaching,
Her household, her assembly;
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
That hunted, hunted so, to see,
He deposes doom,
Bait it with the balsam,
The sexton keeps the key to,
Even as herself, O friend!
As soon as you have come,
And yet, inspected closely,
A hurrying home of little men
Chamber and state and throng;
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
Belshazzar had a letter, —
AUTUMN.
And was he confident until
Around this quiet courtier
   Unto her sacrament.
Till it is lost in fleeces;
A ROSE.
XXVII.
Who is to blame? The weaver?
I wonder if when years have piled —
"But, madam, is there nothing else
Peace, by its battles told;
   When March is scarcely here
Of more esteem than ducats.
Our departed are.
   Conquers mortality.
The sunrise shook from fold,
I have not told my garden yet,
The maple wears a gayer scarf,
A rapid, footless guest,
Till with long fright and longer trust
To an admiring bog!
I had not hoped before.
The wind begun to rock the grass
Lingers to record thee;
When it is said,
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
Or who died yesterday!
Behind this mortal bone
   From an abundant sky.
My fingers were awake;
The purple could not keep the east,
They 're here, though; not a creature failed,
As gold the pyrites would shun.
Rank after rank, with even feet
Serpent cannot charm;
I 'm sure it is Golconda,
Unborn, except they had beheld,
Wild nights should be
That they remember me;
Aground, upon the sands.
New children play upon the green,
Telling my tardy name, —
I could be
'T was universe that did applaud
I shall know why, when time is over,
And did the sunshine face his way?
And is held low to freezing lips
   Then nearer, then so slow
Is shorter than a snake's delay,
Rhodora's cheek is crimson, —
THE LONELY HOUSE.
In amber lies;
Had broken rank,
Venice could not show a cheek
How long at that celestial wick
Nature, the gentlest mother,
Their hundred hats they raise!
I say, as if this little flower
At me, the sea withdrew.
I have so much to tell!
   His furniture is love.
Going to heaven!
Initial of creation, and
And covered up our names.
The bat is dun with wrinkled wings
ASLEEP.
Wild nights! Wild nights!
   What portion of me I
Insolvent, every noon.
A drop fell on the apple tree,
I can wade grief,
What competitions ran
Where I proposed to go
Just quartering a tree.
They died, vitality begun.
Until they lock it in the grave,
A bone has obligations,
   Each one of us shall be;
As if some little Arctic flower,
Oftener through realm of briar
    Prodigal of blue,
Ourself, behind ourself concealed,
If such it prove, it prove too
That such have died enables us
The saints shall meet
When cancelled by the frost.
