Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge The dogs on Main Street howl
Down in Jungleland The midnight gang's assembled
I'm caught in a crossfire
No retreat, baby, no surrender Well, now young faces grow sad and old
Things been a little tight
In Harlem late last night
Would they have dumped me if they knew I'd strike a bridge?
Tonight all is silence in the world
Just a little of that human touch Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town
Aww no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
that some day it may raise me Above these badlands, you gotta live it every day
Facing up to their responsibilities
To become a man and grow up to dream again
Everybody wanted to kick my ass back there in freehold
Because French cream won't soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone
But each lover's steps fall so differently
I'm dying for some action
Singin' our birthday songs
Out on the edge of town
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied
I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A. Got in a little hometown jam
O Mary don't you weep
Honey I'm tougher than the rest The road is dark
Filled with lumber, coal and hay
When you're in love with a Jersey girl Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound
Keep on going, we gonna go home now
Lift me up, darling
Contacts made, they flash unseen
He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
I told her my story and who I'd come for
'Cause point blank
Underneath your pillow
And your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Little gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
I remember running up the street, past the condo to the church here in
Or their hearts give in
I don't need your rings of gold
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no friend of mine Well the night was like any other, well I got a call 'bout quarter to nine
That'll bring you down She'll let you in herheart
We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other
Tell me baby where did you go
Must be a lonely life for a working girl Little girl, I want to marry you
Ohh ohh ohh
Alright, alright, well alright, well alright, well alright, well alright
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
I check my look in the mirror
And first felt the sun on his face
Though I know the river is dry
My blood brother Do you still say your prayers little darlin'
O Mary don't weep O Mary don't weep, don't mourn
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
You show up and then you shy away
You were standin' in the doorway out of the rain
Lies this world In the deep forest
Right between the eyes, baby, point blank
Bring it home, yeah bring it home
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
When I come by to take you out to eat
Right between the eyes
That face off against each other out in the street
But all he kept talking about was Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Shot between the eyes
Mister I ain't a boy, no, I'm a man
I can hear the wild wind blowing
To all the girls down at Sacred Heart
Put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold
Wait for me
Well people they can be pretty mean
I just want to hear some rhythm
So Mary, climb in
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl I see you on the street and you look so tired
Oh, and that's alright with me You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
As the band plays
Janey don't you lose heart Well you say you got no new dreams to touch
In the middle of the pouring rain Well if I could I surely would
Like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away Point blank
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
They must have shot you in the head
You better look hard and look twice
Looking for I don't know what for
And one car that will do
To the Mesabi iron range
I'm talking 'bout a Tenth
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I got a deal for you right here I ain't lookin' for praise or pity
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
Ooh, fire You had a hold on me
Gonna be a twister to blow everything down
Ah looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
When I hold Candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine She has fancy clothes and diamond rings
And these badlands start treating us good Workin' in the fields
Oh, but Mama, that's where the fun is
Yeah there ain't a man in this whole town
Better days are shining through Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane
Little girl, I want to marry you Now honey, I don't want to clip your wings
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
Baby point blank you been fooled this time
Ridin' by your side in my car
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East
You spend your life waiting
Went out and hoped in my old Ford
And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go Well I saw you last night down on the avenue
Give you a little of that human touch
I'll take your sorrow if you want me to
No it ain't cynthia
Janey said it was time to go
You got a lot to learn, close your eyes
I showed 'em where their dad was born and raised
In empty bars where guitars ring out
I go driving deep into the light, in Candy's eyes She says, baby if you want to be wild
Their blood and tears rushed over me
Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze
You wait on that welfare check
What it's like to live and die Prove it all night
Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there
There's one thing mister, that I know
Your life's been wasted
She's the one Oh oh, and just one kiss, she's fill them long summer nights with her tenderness
I can feel my heart begin to pound
Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Pay me my money down
Oh, she's the one
How far'd you get
Having a home and a family
Do you go to bed at night
With her hands on her hips, oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me
And leaves you with nothing mister but
Well don't waste your time waiting Badlands, you gotta live it every day
We'll prove it all night
You say you don't like it
The girls in their summer clothes
If you're rough enough for love
And hard times come, hard times go
Everybody sing Rosalita, jump a little higher
She'll let you deep inside
Come on baby this laugh's on me Stay on the streets of this town
Don't you know that I've been there
I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun
I run when you call
And these romantic dreams in my head Once we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
So when you look at me
And it seems the game I've played has made you strong
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, 'cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
You come home late and get undressed
For just the in-betweens
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
Well, don't you know it can't be that way anymore
Even if we're just dancing in the dark Message keeps getting clearer
I want control right now
Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And if I should fall behind
Down in the street making all that noise
When your best hopes and desires, are scattered through the wind
I remember how my heart beat
The hungry and the hunted
And you don't like, don't like the way I talk
I'll never forget the feeling of that first 5 bucks in my pocket
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms
I got such a bad reputation
Everything'll be okay
And maybe everything dies that's a fact
May I feel your blood mix with mine
And hear your sister's voice calling us home
I got a time bomb tickin' deep inside of me
But there's one thing I know for sure
And in my heart it still survives
Everyday was just you and me
You were 13 but way ahead of your time
Sad eyes never lie Baby don't you know I don't care
For you to roam empty-hearted through this land
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss,
O Mary don't you weep Well Mary wore 3 links of chain
I got two strong arms waitin' to hold you
To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found
From Albany to Bufallo Low bridge, ev'rybody down
But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
With the devil snapping at my heels I broke through the trees and there in the night
When out go the lights
Now i'm standing on this empty road, where nothing moves but the wind.
And all our youth and beauty, it's been given to the dust
I go driving, driving deep into the night
And they asked me if I would do a little number And I sang with all my might
To get a dirty job done Well listen up stud
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
But I always end up stumblin' in a half trance
Trouble in the heartland
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Musta been a tear from your eye
And undid an extra button on her blouse
Just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
That's what makes us great In the quiet of the night
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Hey, that's me and I want you only
And pulled straight out of freehold My sister had her first little baby at 17 in freehold
Families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
And a woman I can call my friend These are better days baby
Fire You had a hold on me
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft, sweet, little girl's tongue
Now they blew up his house too
O Mary don't you weep God gave Noah the rainbow sign
Man turns his back on his family, well he just ain't no good Well Franky went in the army back in 1965
That ain't got the faith to stand its ground
You got a one-way ticket to the promised land
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
Man and woman circle each other in a cage
Darlin' I'll wait for you
But it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin
I remember when we used to have a lot more hair in freehold
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win I get up in the evening
The story's always the same
In cars rushin' by
And the blood rushes in my veins, the fire rushes towards the skies
An ice cream truck on a deserted street
The way things were when we were at your place
And smote' the water with a two by four
Better days with a girl like you These are better days baby
Until they rip out my heart
And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover
Rabbit ears and camel rears
These days you don't wait on Romeos
With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream, I wish she'd just leave me alone
I'm thinkin' back, baby, to you and me
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars
Cynthia, you don't smile or say "hi"
My fate decided
I turn on the radio
There's something happening somewhere
Darlin' don't you know
Down on Blessing Avenue
I'm pulling you close
Well she's a yeah, yeah, alright
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
Fire
Let them burn
Strangers from the city, call my baby's number and they bring her toys
Cover me, shut the door and cover me
There's something happy and there's something sad
You didn't answer when I called out your name
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready
Happy baby, come the dark
Without losin' the love that remains
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
Time slippin' away
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
I wanna be with you
In '69 he left and he never come back to freehold
And I'm gonna do a little favor for him Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
Blow away the dreams that tear you apart
I want to know if love is wild
Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Baby I'll spill the facts
Woo ooo ooo I had a friend was a big baseball player
There was a kid lyin' on the floor lookin' bad, bleedin' hard from his head
There was a girl cryin' at a table and it was Frank, they said Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights
That I could do,
Learned real good right now
A little of the glory of, well time slips away
She says when she feels like crying
Right back home to Buffalo Low bridge, ev'rybody down
I need you to chase the blues away
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
That's if you think your heart is stone
She checked herself out in the dining room mirror
Your smell drifts through our bedroom
You may wonder how come I love you
My baby and I
Oh that's right, oh yeah
Whoa-oh, she's the one
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
But I gotta know how it feels
Said, "No more water but fire next time"
Well if you're rough and ready for love
And when the night closed in
Hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin' Now there's girls melting on the beach
Who doubts what he's sure of So let the frozen sands crumble, crumble and fall
Who's that man who thinks
Well mister they vanished right into the air
it say's you're never gonna leave her
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way Yeah me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood
Tell her to push over and move them big feet
This kiss, this heartbeat this breath
Hey, what else can we do now?
Tenth Avenue freeze-out... The times are tough now, just getting tougher
The mystery in your smile
she's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
That's alright, I gotta dream
Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night
He said, "Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do"
'cept once he drove from california, 3000 miles in three days
Me and Mary we met in high school
In the middle of the pouring rain
Every fool's got a reason for feelin' sorry for himself
Tear all your walls down My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
Found the ore that was linin' yellow creek
And she said, Tell me, are you a Christian child?"
Fed my children and made my pay
In a world gone wild
You just say no
You don't even know what from Well they shot you point blank
I say I wanna stay
Now all them things that seemed so important
Lift me up, and I'll fall with you lift me up
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
Well alright oo yeah
It was hard to hear
If ya made your livin' on the Erie Canal Low bridge, ev'rybody down
Turn out the light, bolt the door
You feel like a stranger babe who knows too much
And you'll always know your pal
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
Ooh...growin' up I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere, and you know it's really hard to hold your breath
The gypsy swore our future was right
If you got a hammer and a vise
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
Like a spirit in the night (all night), all night (all night)
'cause I can't talk now, I'm not alone
I walk this world in wealth
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
Where all the shadow and darkness and above me a dark sky unfurls.
Or the promise tomorrow brings
I don't even know why, I don't know why I made this call
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Now promise me baby you won't let them find us
That come the twilight should we lose our way
When you get on my nerves like you do
In the cold black water Johnson Lineir stands
And I can't go home When the change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band
Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you
Yeah I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me In Candy's room there are pictures of her heroes on the wall
Low bridge, we're coming to a town
Where you can hear the laughter of children ring
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
You just walk on by, darlin' week after week
You say it ain't ours anymore to win
Across the open yards
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
Till you spend half your life just covering up Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.
That the flesh does surely hold
Bang bang baby you're dead Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air
And they brought me down to see her
I walked home with a limb but I felt fine
You know all my dreams come true
She's a good old worker and a good old pal
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked
You can bet your life I'll never part Sal
To buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue
Baby, you picked me up off the ground
He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been [Chorus] I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of Jersey, some misty years ago
Edgy and dull and cut a six inch valley
Well if you're looking for love
Well now, Hazy Davy got really hurt
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
We'd help each other stay in stride
Let your love lift me up I don't need your sacred vow
One step up and two steps back Last night I dreamed that I was a child
When you haven't got a prayer?
Everybody wants to have a home
Spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants
Or in a nameless girl
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we were gettin' robbed
My sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down
Then you've seen me, I always leave with less than I had before
Or just a brilliant disguise Now look at me baby
Yeah just to come again Bring on your wrecking ball
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville, barracks number 8
Tonight, tonight ...
Some fool stuck here watchin' the clock
Right from the start
Rich enough to forget my name In Youngstown
If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight
Well they tempt you, man, with silver
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Come down," I threw up
All that I got to give
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
And I believe in a promised land And I believe in a promised land
I got a bad desire
But just don't look too close
It's one hell of a town, freehold! Some need gold and some need diamond rings
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance Yeah, he was blinded by the light
