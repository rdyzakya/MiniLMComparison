So I must leave you all alone
That's the least that we can do
When they ask who's in the picture with me
John stood there beside me
Well, that's a different situation He'll just walk off and leave her
Everything I'd promised Him
Oh sweet Jesus if you're out there, keep me ever close to you
Can you help me go the distance?
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
Just to see him smile
He talks so sweet to me
Handing me a yellow rose
But she's an eagle when she flies She's a sparrow when she's broken
Of a cold false-hearted lover
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.
And when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light
I thought it so romantic
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head And I ain't been home in I don't know when
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
We don't have to work alone
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
And he's gonna marry me His momma don't like me one little bit
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
Sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton
Yes, you left me
Winter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten
Good ol' Rocky Top
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
I was just the victim of
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Because you miss me, do you darling
And we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
You've caused me to leave my home In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
With no word of farewell
There is no weaker than I am
The woman you thought I'd be
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
He'll use your body and tangle your mind;
The stone's been rolled away
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And they always put you to the test
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Somewhere between your heart and mine
Oh i could've loved you better
To make you treat me so
But if she ever breaks your heart
And sometimes I believe you love me
I'm a puzzle I must figure out
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
You know that was the last thing on my mind You know that was the last thing on my mind (Dolly Parton) Daddy was an old time preacher man
Until the day they lay me down In dreams of you, my body trembles
I guess we're promising a lot, but for now it's all we've got
Don't call it love
If she ever leaves you blue
Why you take for instance this old broken heart
They shown beneath his blue eyes Why don't you go home
If the teardrops ever start
Let him hold you tight
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, working 9 to 5 Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Too late you'll learn this lesson Repeat Chorus When love grows cold, it's tragic Verse 2: Mother, oh mother, he's not that way
I would always hunger
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
He's the only love for me.
Show you the loneliness
She's the leaning post of life
Would find me beside you
Happy happy birthday baby (Dolly Parton) Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Get their corn from a jar Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We were young and foolishly mistaken
Swear no love but yours will do
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
In sorrow and tears
Heaven's choir will smile
Sail away with me to another world
And some say they never will Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
I spent the night in sleeplessness
Jolene I had to have this talk with you
You asked me out
-- Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
And we still talking when it come daylight
And you better get to livin'. Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
What you need
With a strange and sweet perfume
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
That momma carefully wrote
Little sparrow, little sparrow
For he believed that God provides a way
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
Will there be not a trace left behind
With many kinds of pain Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
You might as well since you already here
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
From one lover to another, ah-ah Sail away
No no no no We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
When I'll walk alongside of him
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies Love is like a butterfly
And there was just so much we had to say hey
And lovin' on the way
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
And who knows it might last for life
Wildflowers don't care where they grow And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
In the shelter of your care each day
The line between the two is fine
With all you do, your attitude
So I'll close this note to you
We must forget the passing time
Oh oh oh oh two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
Hallelujah He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Like a blushing rose in a dazzling dew,
Of left over memories
Slowly losing sight of the real thing But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
You left me
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
Is here you come again and here I go All you gotta do is smile that smile
I have you here [Repeat chorus]
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
And rose at every sound
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Here in a world of lies
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
A broken heart will have to pay the cost You know I love you and I always will
And you better get to livin'... (Dolly Parton) Say forever you'll be mine
You better get to livin'. A girlfriend came to my house
Ever since the moment that I met you
The bargain store is open, come inside There's a wreath on the door
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLD OAK TREE
If he ever leaves you blue
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
Her only son had passed into the light Welcome home, son
And I fell down on my knees
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
Do you ever think back on old memories at all
'Cause you left me
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
Hello God, we really need you
They'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
And he said you can call me Joshua
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In a garden so different from me
Could I use you for a while,
But with a little mending it could be as good as new
She don't live here no more
You back into another place in time
If she asks
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
From another dream of you
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
Don't waste one minute of this life
There's a door without any key Somewhere between your heart and mine
I'm not sure of where I've been
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
'Cause you're making plans to leave The tears for me will be falling
Oh, how could we say goodbye Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
But that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy (Dolly Parton) Hello, are you free tonight
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans
And as happy as the laughter of a child
When everything is broken, we can mend it if we try
We got a better thing, baby Don't call it love
From here to the moon and back I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years I'll be your friend, I'll be your lover
(together, together)
And when I'm born again
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately
But even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance. All dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,
Share your dreams and share your laughter
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
With His arms held open wide
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah Islands in the stream
You can smile
That the dollar sign
And wanna be a mule skinner Yodel-a-ee-he-he
I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
Just sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
Your kiss is warm and tender
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Light that came from everywhere
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
And the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary
She has seen and done it all
So darlin', save the last dance for me Ooh darling, save the last dance for me
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her heart's as soft as feathers
From crying when he calls your name
To wear his wedding band Now I know that I'm no angel
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Forever together, together you and I will always be
Before the next teardrop falls I'll be there, I'll be there
To know, know, know him
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
And to mine I said I'd go
Never any end What will the neighbors say?
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
Is a chain of broken dreams But you know that I love you
To hold out just for you?
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
So strong that I can't let you go Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
That's peaceful and still
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man [Spoken] I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.
We have made a mockery of
You bring me the sunshine when none is in sight
The greenest state in the land of the free
All that's left behind
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made
The two have bound me heart and soul
And I saw a smile come across his face
Can you help me like before?
Tennessee, Rocky Top It's a lesson too late for the learning
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
For we know not what we do Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Do you love some more than others?
Yesterday must be forgot
If I had it all to do over again
And you did walk in tonight
Winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door
You better get to knowin', showin'
Farewell to all you ladies
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
And we're gonna go to town
There's a place on the hill
Now I miss you more
Dance, dance, dance, dance If you go, I'll follow you
And they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies
She didn't even seem to notice
You say you need me and it's too bad
It's so hard for me to believe
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', as I'm travelin' thru Momma moved out
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
With folks like me on the job from nine to five Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
I will always love you
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly" She used to rock me when I was a child
Hey, 've been working in Georgia
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life
Ansewers but a few
You left in the rain without closing the door
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
(forever you and I du-du)
Let me lean on you
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
And baby
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
With a little mendin' it could be as good as new The bargain store is open, come inside
And to all who knew me when...
Still she weathers stormy skies
The game is over now and we've both lost
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
And all the king's horses
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody In my Tennessee mountain home
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years, and I'll be here
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Momma's gone
Better start sharin'
We're burning as bright as any star
I know you're married but I love you still
To learn the greater truth We've all been crusified
Hey hey If you don't like your job
Until the end, there'll be no other
That once held me so gentle and close Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
And for no good reason to
All this love we feel
How you could easily take my man
That is what we are
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
And the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Yes, you know I'm on the road
Hey hey I won't take your pay Yodel-a-ee-he-he
The day you left my teardrops fell
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
But ya' know I feel so sad
Your touch is soft and gentle
This I know is true. You better get to livin', givin'
He left with another the year you were born.
Flies so high and feels no pain If I were a little sparrow
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly Repeat chorus Tag: Let her fly
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
'Cause you're making plans to leave You're making plans to forget me
But I just need someone so much
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
And this was the maddens reply
Oh sweet Jesus if you're listening, keep me ever close to you
Please, please don't stop loving me
And I'll love you good or bad Where you go I'll go with you
Well, it's the only life I know But you know that I love you
He preached about the great eternity
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did The bargain store is open come inside
Oh and they can call it what they like
With flaming locks of auburn hair
Just to find the note
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Then they'll leave you for another
And I'm wakin' up
And left to daddy
I wish you love
Someday he will see
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
I feel it when you're with me
You surely remember when you felt that way
I'm not holding you tonight
And I struggled for something to say
In the name of all that's true
In your name, defending you
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Is it ok if I stop by
It's your happiness that matters most of all
Two fools Starting over again
And your wardrobe way outdated
We're here to learn the spirit burns
Crickets sing in the fields near by Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling
Me and Joshua
Do you ever recall these old memories at all
WRITERS RUSSELL BROWN, IRWIN LEVINE I'm comin' home, I've done my time Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine If you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free Then you'll know just what to do if you still want me If you still want me Just tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree It's been way too long, do you still want me? If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree I'll just stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree Bus driver, please look for me 'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see I'm really still in prison and my love, he holds the key A simple yellow ribbon's all I need to set me free I wrote and told him please... Just tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree It's been way too long, do you still want me? If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree I'll just stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree Tie a yellow ribbon 'round that old oak tree I'm coming home Now the whole dang bus is cheerin' and I can't believe I see a hundred yellow ribbons tied 'round the old oak tree I'm comin' home, I'm glad you waited for me Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree Tie a ribbon 'round the old oak tree Tie a ribbon 'round the old oak tree Tie a yellow ribbon if you still want me Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree Here you come again
Oh, you left me Just when I needed you most We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto
I'm just traveling traveling
Joshua Joshua
You know that I love you
Before the next teardrop falls All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
And how or where they'd taken Him
Play a song, let your banjo ring Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
Drove shadows from the room
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
Look into his lying eyes
We'll just live our lives one day at a time In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Good Lord, have mercy on a country girl
And picked up the note
Dish it out or take it all
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way
But you know that I love you If she brings you happiness
So I'll go, and but I know
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold But teardrops aren't pennies
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
Now most every morning
I'll bring love to him
Just because I'm a woman Now a man will take a good girl
And to your surprise
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, working 9 to 5 Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
As I'm travelin' travelin' through (Repeat, Repeat)
Turned my dreams around
Where that is no one can tell me, am I doomed to ever roam
And sing, "oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Though the yellow's turned to blue
I'm just traveling through ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
If that's what you thought you'd found
Everything's easy now
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
Please don't take him just because you can Your beauty is beyond compare
Your voice is soft like summer rain
Oh, and do your memories ever take
And share my thoughts
Turned my world around
Well, you can throw your bucket down
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
Never any end
Flies so high and feels no pain
Was just an empty shell
I will always love you Bitter-sweet memories
I'm asking for thy blessing. Daughter, oh daughter, I know his kind.
You can't leave my love behind
And our darling mother is gone Mommy got sick
And I need to somehow let you know
Our ears could not believe it
The little girl's feet
Play a song for me and I'll sing
I'd give this world dear to belong to you
But we'll all met in heaven again Chorus: Oh, she's an angel
Go and have your fun
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
I'll think of you each step of my way
I want to know your dreams
And now this travelin' life
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Everytime you touch me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Precious fragile little thing
From here to the moon and back
With a love both true and strong
You think he's handsome, you think he's fine.
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
You better stop whining, pining
Just when I needed you most
Where all my pieces fit Chorus Like a poor wayfairing stranger
And I refused to just wither in place Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.
Even death could never end this love of mine I have loved you for so long
You've never been out on your own
Ooh darlin', save the last dance for me
The years have shown no kindness
Makes my life worthwhile
I was your pretty
If you will just replace the missing parts
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
He's real smart with a real big heart
But the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten
Than I missed you before
I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find what feels like home
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Wildflowers don't care where they grow
He's gonna buy me a ring
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet Nine to five, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Throw it down boy, throw it down Yodel-a-ee-he-he
Intoxicating like cherry sweet wine.
For I couldn't make it alone
[Chorus]
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And what it does
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam. I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
I'm just travelin' travelin' travelin'
This could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry
Are you sending your new love
Daddy you can load the rifles up
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
So negative the words she had to say
I will always love you (Dolly Parton) The hills were alive with wildflowers
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
And so we headed out to find our promised land Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
Here I go You know I love you and I always will
Took my dreams and I took to the road
So let it's water wash my sins away
And I do When the mornin' sun
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
Till my road comes to an end I'm out here on my journey
Go and carry on till the night is gone
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
Baby, I will hurt you never
It happens when you kiss me
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
Cause he's gonna marry me Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
How blind can he be
Be willing and forgivin'
In your hand, in your hand Are you going away
Tender love is blind
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
How I wish we could go back in time
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
If she did, she never did say so to daddy One morning we awoke
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Through our rockin' years I want to feel this way
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
And how my momma put the rags to use There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And these words he spoke
And found them
His only son was due from overseas
[ steel ]
But that was before I met you I thought I'd stay single always be free
"Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness"
And that little old shack it was a happy home
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
As I was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin'
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone Ain't ya got no gingerbread
'Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
The love was shining out from Him
She's an eagle when she flies I can see you're disappointed
For her children some day
Some are lucky, others ain't
Flies so high and feels no pain All ye maidens fair and tender
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
You packed in the morning I stared out the window
The depth and the breadth of my love for you? From here to the moon and back
When at last it came to choices
He-he-he-he-he-he
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
Keep your chin up
Hello God Hello God, can you grant us
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
So darlin', save the last dance for me Oh, I know
I will always love you And I hope life, will treat you kind
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
They've never seen a fire this hot
No looking back no matter what
Out of the past of yesterday
Just think of all the shame
It's too late to love me now Two little children a boy and a girl
"I've waited so long for this day
Fine as he can be
I hear God say as they embrace
Upon your farewell not
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
Down in the Tennessee hills
'Cause there was no land of promise
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
And I hope I'll see you down the road, you meant more than I knew
This is no way to be livin',
That big black dog and that little old shack
Don't feel sorry for yourself
When you think about love, think about me We were strangers
Welcome home!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
And none of us know where
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you better not set foot on his land
Until they come true
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong If I'll keep looking to the Father
She said they've moved Him in the night
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
But somewhere between your heart and mine
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack
Writing a letter to pass time away
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
I met him at the big barn dance
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
'Cause I need you more
To do the best she can
You meant more than I knew
But I can't ever seem to count that far
Break your little heart in two Little sparrow, little sparrow
How precious is this love we share
I love him so, I love him so.
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Although you're with somebody new
From which there flows a fountain
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are...
Oh give me some direction lord, let me lean on you
The guilt and anguish came
And nothing is in vain
And there's nothing I can do to keep
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever No more crying tears leave tracks
I knew that you'd return to me
But it's too late to love me now
I wake up and call your name
And there go all my defenses
And I'll be there
Some are fighters, others faint
To drag us all away
That we'll be happy all the time
'Cause I've got so much to give
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Half bear the other half cat
To you mommy I said
That they speak about in song
And I am only happy when you are by my side
He told the people of he need to pray
Just tell 'em you're my everything
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Am I doomed to ever roam
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
To dwell in those mansions so bright
Yes, just to know him
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Like the poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song
Play a song, let your banjo ring That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
Oh I still love you so Yellow roses
We're having a party just two doors down I can't believe I'm standing here dry-eyed, all smiles & talkin'
Even death could never end this love of mine
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
What first was heaven soon turned to hell
And I cannot compete with you
You can dance
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, I've been working down in Georgia
He's always been a momma's boy
Just what i was
A man that let me down Yes, I've made my mistakes
The sexton came early
'Cause my heart has only room for one
I told you he's dead and buried. Repeat Chorus Bridge: He'll love me true 'cause he told me so.
And he's gonna marry me
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? I am a vessel that's empty and useless
Until the day they lay me down I close my eyes and you're there with me
While she sits at home
And all the windows fastened down
Crickets sing in the fields near by Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Go ahead and tell 'em baby Feels so good, holding tight
About what's been and what awaits me
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Your laughter brings me sunshine
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
He's alive yes He's alive
I am just the broken dream
Don't turn me away I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
Tryin' to find my own way home Oh, sweet jesus if you're out there
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
Is to love love love him
Just what I did not know
I would find him,yes I would find him
That I wish this happy day
I would flutter all around him
Sittin' on the front porch swing People always comin' up to me and askin'
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
And heartaches aren't gold (Dolly Parton) Little sparrow, little sparrow
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Oh, the pain of loving you
The words that she had written there to daddy She said our kids are old enough
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
Happy, happy birthday baby
Hey hey and I'm sick of it
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
Was all we'd need to live
And we're all children of the light
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
Oooo... Don't call it love
If you're all alone, can she take you home
Why do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land"
And just before the sunrise
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
But holdin' to each other, we don't have to walk alone
You are the true [Chorus:]
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Some are addicts, drunks and strays
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
The postman was passing
You walked into my life
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Life can't be simple again Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Making up a happy home
I just let him decide where I'd go
You've been on my mind
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
This heart of mine [Chorus] Well, good morning, Captain
No one in-between
And mem'ries find their way back
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
But above all this
'Cuz even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt. To know, know, know him
Than I loved you before
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Daddy sold the house
And the message is clear
Just when I've begun to get myself together
To a single yellow rose And for years to come
One we made some time ago
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
You are Those memories of you still haunt me
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
And the gifts he never gave her
As soft and gentle as a sigh
I'm making plans to miss you
You loved me at one time
That's all I'll ask of you
Just sorting out pieces
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
He preached so plain a child could understand
I want to do I want to hold you close under the rain
We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
In a world without you
Please don't go, please don't go Are you going away
Redemption comes in many shapes
I want to change the world
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
We got somethin' goin' on
That's all I am taking with me
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
I like your looks, I love your smile
You are all I'll every have
We ride it together, ah-ah
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
Didn't mean to be unkind
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
And if I should ever hear
But you'll never keep her down
He-he-he-he-he-he Well I'm a lady mule skinner
And his evil cunning scheme Little sparrow, little sparrow
She said she would come
And then just shine, design, refine
And every fear I ever had
You got to tell her no And don't forget who's takin' you home
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
Live on dreams alone
And here I go
No matter where you take me to
You were the one
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
And I guess she's coming tonight
Sat by an old church door
My love for you is the real kind
Until the day they lay me down Peace in the valley for me some day Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
But you got dreams he'll never take away
Me and Joshua (Dolly Parton) Take my hand and run with me
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family
From one lover to another, ah-ah I can't live without you if the love was gone
Addressed to the master
Keep me ever close to you
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Sweet yellow roses
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried Oh, why do we keep holding on
And you are my last hope
We can mend it if we try
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
Oh, I do wish you joy
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, hey hey, little water boy
If you don't love us no one will
He'll break you heart when love grows old.
Welcome home son
Beneath the snow white
From one lover to another, ah-ah (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Please, please don't stop loving me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Mule skinner blues (Traditional) In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
But she's an eagle when she flies
I'm a puzzle, I must figure out where all my pieces fit
We've no one to love us
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
As of today, she flew home
Made just for me I could hold out my arms, say "I love you this much"
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
Like a poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song
The place that you were meant to be
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
And when I'm born again, you're gonna see a change in me God made me for a reason and nothing is in vain
Nine to five, for service and devotion
I stare out the window
My mommy ran away again
We've all been crucified and they nailed Jesus to the tree
But she's an eagle when she flies Gentle as the sweet magnolia
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
Jolene And I can easily understand
You choose your lovers, you pick your friends
and we'll always be together you and I
Why did you have to go
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Heaven's gates are open wide
But hold in to each other
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew
If you would just send one to me
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
It said to love you through eternity Now knowing that you were another's bride
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Without your love I'd go insane Those memories of you still haunt me
Longer than time
We can make the world a difference
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Fall on your knees and pray
Oh, bless her, Lord
With good luck and wishes too
like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.
Jolene, Jolene (Dolly Parton) If I should stay
When you tell me that you love me I want to make you see
Why did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring
All the impossible
And just like him I was all alone
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
Never trust the hearts of men
There's a love I can't understand
Circumstance and speculation
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
Where do you begin
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it Nine to five, yeah they got you where they want you
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I still love you so I never see a yellow rose
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down,yeah Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
Still I go on loving you
Here I end feeling everything but sorry (Dolly Parton) Hello God, are you out there?
Cause all healing has to start with you
Then, daughter, why are you asking?
Just a flame, that's lost its glow
Then I wish you both the best
You say you want me and it's too late
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Underground, underground
Down inside my heart
'Cause that ain't enough
We're in great need of your love
She didn't mind the stayin' home
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
Just tell 'em you're my everything Oh, oh, oh
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
Loving you through the night
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
How much and how far would I go to prove
Up in heaven with their mommy that night (Dolly Parton) She's been there, God knows, she's been there
And two doors down they're not aware that I'm around
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
Love everlasting, I promise you that
Hey hey yeah Yodel-a-ee-he-he
But I know I must keep travelin' till my road comes to an end
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly I can't forget you
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall In my Tennessee mountain home
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
Down on your new mud run?
So darlin', save the last dance for me
And many dreams have withered on the vine
Let's be honest with each other
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
You waltz right in the door
Then we'll both know where we stand
Then I pray you're new love's lasting. Repeat Chorus Tag: When love grows cold, it's tragic.
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
And I know they're thinking of me
Get your dreams in line
Until the day they lay me down
The gate began to rattle
It's all wrong, but it's all right It may be wrong if we make love
Me and Joshua yeah yeah
But I know that they all love me
With a single yellow rose Yellow roses
I stared out the window
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And he's gonna marry me Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de The gates and doors were barred
Oh, do you ever miss the feelings
Oh, the misery I go through
We've got a better thing, baby
Oh, I love you
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
Angels took her away
We may leave little marks in life's design
Can you help us like before?
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
As they embraced I heard him say
Good morning to you, Sir
When it's family, when it's family
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever ... (Floyd Parton) I'll do everything I can to make you proud to be my man
My happiness depends on you
The caboose went by at nine In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
That you ever dreamed of
I know you're married but I love you still I love you so much I can't let you go
We'll just live our lives one day at a time This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Ain't ya got no candy
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Everyone says there'll come a day
She's just as fragile as a child
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
He's gonna marry me
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
Hello God, hello, hello
Just because I'm a woman No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
With no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind
But I never understand To love and hate at the same time
I hear him say as they embrace
Than I needed before
Let her fly, let her fly
And you shiver when the cold wind blows I asked my captain for the time of day
Got to pay the rent
I'm out here on my journey, trying to make the most of it
He's the only one for me
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
You find yourself alone
Can't you feel it with your touch
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home." Welcome home!
They're talking talk, it's small town news
From one lover to another, ah-ah Islands in the stream
Heaven's above
Now I don't recall who said it
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
It might even rain awhile
You can easily afford the price
Too deep in love and we got no way out
I'm getting ready to grieve I'm making plans to be lonesome
I could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
Just a word unto the wise
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.
My bright yellow rose buds
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee
So strong that I can't let you go To love and hate at the same time
As she told me where she'd been
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
But I could never love again
It's still my favorite flower
When you've never been out on your own
Streaks across my room
From down old Tennessee way
Disappeared in sweet release
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon But I ain't been home in I don't know when
The place where you were meant to be
Good-bye you little children
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
If she did, she never did say so to daddy The only things that seemed to be important in her life
O'er these mountains I would fly
And I will always love you
Sitting down by the railroad track
Starting over again
On my little sparrow wings
And I wish you happiness
You can keep her in you vision
She's happy up there with her mommy I know (Dolly Parton) Hello you said the day we met
The dirt's too rocky by far
Sittin' on the front porch swing
And this far down the road
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo (Dolly Parton) He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
Trying to make the most of it
That I think about you all the time [Chorus:]
She was spinnin' such a sad tale
Have a pretty little babe of three
'Cause that ain't enough I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
It's all wrong, but it's all right The amber sunset glow has died
If she did, she never did say so to daddy He often left her all alone
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
Welcome home, son
You were my baby
Good-bye to daddy Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
Sittin' on the front porch swing Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies
Just like you've done before
And I'm left in the middle again Somewhere between your heart and mine... You can dance
Seems you hurt me all you can
It's all wrong, but it's all right Oooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
They don't think my heart is true
Just the way that Mary said
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
I'll run to you if ever you should call
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Go on and tell 'em baby Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
Wildflowers don't care where they grow I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
Oh, the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again Starting over again
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
As I'm stumblin', tumblin', wonderin', as I'm travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
Then you'll get to livin'. The day we're born we start to die
Jolene He talks about you in his sleep
He'll keep my heads above the water
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said Ain't ya got no gingerbread
And on every occasion
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
I'll always love you, little darling
I vowed I'll always be close by your side
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
Looking at you
You better get to livin', givin'
I'll always love you, my little darling
Tennessee homesick blues I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton
Never knowing what to do
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now I've had years of cramped up city life
So when you think about love, think about me
Why must thou be opposed to me
Good-night you handsome men
Once again it seems
I will never ever let you go
Are you going away
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Oh, I know you are a mountain
How very precious, sweet and rare
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief Welcome home, son
When everything is broken
Hey hey, I come from Tennessee I can make any mule listen
Home sweet home to me
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
So if they ask you what your feelings are Don't call it love
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And I will guarantee you'll be completely satisfied Take these old used memories from the past
Everyday is spring time
She's a lover, she's a mother
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
and we'll always be together you and I. --
Together, you and I........ You say tomorrow you're going
My needs are very much alive
Let me be all that I should be to the family (Dolly Parton) Well a good ways down the railroad track
On promises made and love without end
But you know I don't care
Please, please don't stop loving me An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time Just one thing I'm learning...
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
I'm just like a weary pilgrim
If we want to we can fllly.
No, no, no Don't call it love
And you always try to do your best
Make some points for the great hereafter. Better start carin'
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most
Leaving you to never mend
I can give you more than you'll ever need
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
One is only poor only if you choose to be It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' on Questions I have many, answers but a few
If you go, I'll follow you.... With great anticipation he waited at the door
And do that everyday
I believe it He's alive
London bridge is fallin' down
No no Yodel-a-he-ho Me and Joshua
I don't think you agree
John believed a miracle
Won't you bring your water 'round?
Just close your eyes and fantasize
But I just turned to go
But the rain will go away
And how often I long for those two loving arms
And the thought of you
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried
Better start smiling
Just melted into peace He's alive yes He's alive
My son, my very own... Welcome home." Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
To her home in the sky
Sing "rock of ages" and "in the sweet bye and bye"
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Then John ran on ahead
And the whole world cries Got an apartment
Was more than I could tell Oh something strange had happened there
Just hang tough
I said if I had a violin I'd play. I said you'd better get to livin', givin'
We can make a world of difference, if we want to we can fly Goodbye little children, goodnight you handsome men
Trying to find what feels like home Well, that is no one can tell me
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
What a life we'd have
And you shiver when the cold wind blows The longest train I ever saw
Oh, how I love you But you know I love you
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
I denied I knew His name
Cause that's when we fell in love Do you remember
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not there.
And hold me when I'd cry
And I do Why can't he see
And he took a shine to me
You can toss her around and round
I'm just travelin' on. Questions I have many
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Back to the seasons of my youth
I thought I could never be blue
When the problems of this life
Just added to my shame
She's a woman, she know how to
And still go right on bluffin'
Here you come again and here I go
A big object hit her and sped away fast
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
When it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more
I say just "Someone I use to know" I say just "Someone I use to know" (Dolly Parton) Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied
Not the family that you're in, nah
Yes, I've made my mistakes
Back together, again (Dolly Parton) Chorus:
So I went down to let her in
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied My life is like unto a bargain store
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
Mommy's in heaven
The engine passed at six o'clock
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
That I didn't think of you
To sleep with me at night
I love you, oh, so much You can dance
While he looks for an angel
I would be useless if you ever leave
It flutters like soft wings in flight
And I found you sweet and bold
I will always love I will always, always love you
But that was before I met you
I would ask him, yes I would ask him
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two
you know we'll always be together you and I [Chorus] I always be beside or close behind you.
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
When it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for
Just remember I love you
Guide me and keep me
I think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down Two doors down we're laughing and drinking and having a party
'Cause it lingers
But they ain't got it right
A little more thought about bein'
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
No, I can't call you my baby
The color of sunshine
You know that was the last thing on my mind I've got reason a plenty for goin
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands In my Tennessee mountain home
Islands in the stream
By the way you look at me
All ye maidens hede my warning
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I use to run around with
You said goodbye like you said hello
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger Here you come again
And make them mine
Were as brown as the curl
I'm making plans for the heartaches
My home sweet home I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
And I just clung to Him and cried Then He raised me to my feet
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
I must go, Mother, I must go.
And they don't need me very much
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
With nothing more than high hopes
So please, oh please don't stop loving me Please, please don't stop loving me
You do something to me that I can't explain
And daddy is dead
There was this little old rundown shack
Play a song, let your banjo ring It's too late
We can't make it without you
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I promise we won't cry
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you That was before I met you An old man was sitting at his table one day
Can we stay all night
My resistance leaves me cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
And I hope that you have all
And he'll ruin her reputation
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
And they nailed Jesus to the tree
And roaming like the wind Oh give me some direction lord
Now where do you begin
There's always a brighter day Darling, I won't promise you
Nine to five, yeah they got you where they want you
All your plans just keep on falling through
You know I love you and I always will
Had not yet crossed my mind
Don't sweat the small stuff
But when he wants to marry
More than this I love you as you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
But you don't know what he means to me
I just wonder do I cross your mind Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
But not a one is turned away, when it's family
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home I wish I had my old fishin' pole
It requires a dedication
I didn't stand in your way
And whatever you decide to do
Oh what's a heart to do
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru
Just tell them you're my everything
[ guitar ]
And even if He was alive
Oh, how I love you And if only I could find my way back to the time
And the kids are all grown
He said he throwed his watch away In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
Oh, come sail away with me Islands in the stream
To live and die, and then to live again Welcome home son
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Oh sometimes the road is rugged, and it's hard to travel on
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
Here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
I didn't stand in your way Now I love you more
But she's an eagle when she flies A kaleidoscope of colors
Every night when I lay down
Please don't take him even though you can
"Dolly, what's your secret?
Ain't no telephone bill Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
The names we had for each other
Yes, there will be peace, sweet peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Du-u-u Du-u-u Du-u-u-u-u-u wa Du-u wa My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
We're gonna be so free
And just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family Some are preachers, some are gay
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
But I know I must keep travelin'
And went on their way
And feel your pain
Just because I'm a woman So when you look at me
When the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces
From here to the moon and back From here to the moon and back... Love is like a butterfly
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
That we could start again
And I'll do what you want me to Darling, I won't promise you
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Like the poor wayfaring stranger
Yes, I'll always love you, and I'll always be here for you
Looked down into the street
Lookin' for a moonshine still
From here to the moon and back I want you to know you can always depend
Strait up into heave this letter did go
We're having our own party two doors down Oh oh oh oh two doors down
(Hello God) We beseech you
If you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
As I'm traveling through I'm just traveling traveling traveling.
More than ever
