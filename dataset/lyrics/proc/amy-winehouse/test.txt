And I do
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
Just us on kitchen floor
Although I've been here before
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
He's not for sale, he's being home-delivered to me
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
The sky above ablaze
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
Everyone is so denying
Bright as stars that shine up above you
Can we be alone?
And let your arrow fly.
Does it mean that our love is ending
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Victoria's Secret in my bag
I said 'You don't know what love is - get a grip!' -
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
The time to be
Lookin' for a man
Let me take you by the hand
Otherwise mine's a different way
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
Love is losing game One I wished, I never played
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
Because we are best friends right? It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
But we are best friends, right? I don't like the way you say my name
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, You can't sit down right,
And I go back to Black
Imobile, I can't think by any means
Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all),
Cupid, please hear my cry.
I never can behave
And I'll send all my loving to you All my loving, I will send to you
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
I just want to grip your body over mine
So I can get mine
But you were just a rich girl, and only having fun
When I'll walk alongside of him To know know know him
I can't even think about
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
But who you writing for?
Oh, is there wonder why
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
At his side, and drunk on pride
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Mister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic)
But I left my jacket with you
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
My one and only baby (be my baby now)
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He just chasing tail
And you're attitude become a bore
I'm so tired of being without it
Valerie Well sometimes I go out by myself
It was dark and I was lying down You are everything ' he means nothing to me
Now you want me to suffer just cause
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Of what we had could be intruded
Provides me with uplift Half time
You always want to talk it through, I don't care
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)
It's my responsibility,
Wheres my morel parallel It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
I hope that he turns
My odds are stacked
Cause your dream in life,
A blaze He walks away,
That everyone gets
If we just wait a while
'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe
But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
Its got me addicted, does more than any dick did Yeah I can get mine and you get yours
So I'm sorry if I upset you Tomorrow is another day
I have ever known
I won't go, go, go I'd rather be at home with a Ray
So I'm going to seek
My tears dry on their own, He walks away,
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
Love is a fate resigned Over futile odds
Anything, baby just let me get next to you So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
But it's not that easy, no I gotta know you now
In the sanctuary she has found
Wheres my morel parallel His own style, right down to his diesel jeans
Wait with impatience to throw my cash away.
If you was made of wood and strings
Thought you had so many lessons to learn"
With a pickup that puts you to shame
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
You left for London, when you were nineteen
My soul's on fire, come on and take
Black
My energy's just drained away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Valerie Why don't come over Valerie? Cupid, draw back your bow.
You caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you
Goes Aaah! When she moves it's like a samba
Girls think
You know that I'm no good Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
For every...(all my friends say)
When you live life like its so run through (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
But somehow you missed the plane. You did too much E,
I see you through the smoke Laying on my bed
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
So dust off your fuck me pumps Brother
To add his initial
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
Like two ships passing in the night
And I've missed your ginger hair
The shadow covers me,
And perspective pushes through
And I do Oh I'll be good to him
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing Try to put me in a room, distraction less
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
So now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face
So I can get mine and you get yours I'm my own man
Through our victory and done defeat
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
We may never meet again You should be stronger than me
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this Ruler's one thing, but come Brixton
Funny don'tcha know
He thinks 'What's she running from?
And when my life is over
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
My tears dry on their own So we are history
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone
And your lucky its ladies night
Some unholy war
But how can I expect you to understand
I should have tied up my loose ends
Remember I'll always be true And then while I'm away
So we are history,
And I'm breathless
I just wanted to see what you could do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Love is a losing game It's okay in the day
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
Will you still love me tomorrow He left no time to regret
Valerie Did you have to go to jail,
Left me wanting something new Physical ain't even my type
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? You left for London, when you were nineteen
When he's supposed to be mine Play all my records keep dancing all night
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Cant
Judy's wearing his ring Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
Don't do nothing for ya
No sweeter song, no heart so true There is no greater thrill
Blue without my green
I understand a man confused
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. Or them big ballers,
And spent the night getting caned. Without girls like you,
You recognize my every sound
And your priority, it must be heard
She just doesn't see Runnin' down my batt - er- ies
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway I didn't get a lot in class
But I may have forgotten you
I think I even said I can't help, it need to stop it
Half time
Our day will come (our day will come, our day will come)
Searches the man she misses, the man that he longs to be
innit
And your old tricks no longer work. You should have known from the job,
He that lame, you love how I bring the pain
Is to get the angle right
'Cause what's inside her it never dies So he tries to pacify her
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Although I enjoyed it
I really do
You wouldn't want me to be lonely How can I put it so you understand?
I hear his voice and things get wet
All that I put myself through
Through the puddle in my head
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
When old midnight comes around He can only hold her for so long, the lights are on but no one's home
And I do Why can't he see?
Falling in love can bring No one can tell me that I'm too young to know (young to know)
And that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
So dust off your fuck me pumps You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
At least your breasts cost more than hers So you did Miami
We could a never had it all,
But bring it up and beat the point to death
Of with regret I'd like
I'd rather him leave you than leave him my draw
and while all my contempt
Know you're a gambling man
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
It's your lie, it's your lie
And lately, I 've forgotten who I am
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
I told you I was trouble
Now I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Above we all become what we once hated
Not pal in comparison to who you think I am, You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
That swings so cool and sways so gently
The sun goes down,
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
Like I knew I would
Lately I find
Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong),
In the night in the night
Just, just friends?
It's you I'm fighting for
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee
He's my boo and I'm his little pet, his little pet
Now, how can he have her heart? When it got stole
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
Spare me from worse
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
And he still make this housewife blush
If my man was fighting I couldn't resist him
I love it when it says I got the means,
And did you have to pay that fine
And to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you
When you're home at night
So we are history
The lips that I am missing
You're my number one, that's all, a newborn son
'Cause we'll never be the way we were The way we were, we'll never be
Now she won't be happy
If they call you a skank,
Rockin' your f me pumps
That I live my life by
You went back to what you knew
As my day is done now
Supposed to be the man
Tempted to work Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
Thought we need to find a time
Hold it in your hand
And I tread a troubled track
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
He floats me with dread
It's not cheating; you were on my mind Yes he looked like you
I want to touch you
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh, Slick Rick)
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Well sometimes I go out by myself
The dark covers me, and I cannot run now
Who's lost in the wood
Cry if I want to
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Catch me on, have to ?
You should be stronger than me
We'd go to the club and not see anyone. Without girls like you,
To one
I know I'd look good on you Amy Amy Amy
And these days I just work
A son not a sob story (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
Just friends, just friends?
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
To put on some speed
Is a darkness that we knew,
My life a wreck you're making
You've been here seven years longer than me
In this blue shade
You can only get so much from someone yeah
Living fantasy
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
Like you're reading my will
It serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Everyone says there'll come a day
Because we are best friends right?
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery are we?
Consider the change Rhythm floods my heart
You're always looking for someone to blame
You can get so much from me
I feel it my heart like you were there
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
Now make sure you bite down
We were alone and I was singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
I have to get this down before I leave somehow And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
