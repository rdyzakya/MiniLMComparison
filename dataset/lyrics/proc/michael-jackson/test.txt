Hey Pretty Baby With The
A man and a woman's youngest son

You're living on sunset time

Money.

keep on dreaming there’s nowhere to run
And maybe next year
This Is My Life And I,
Look at the lonely lovers
I'm Gonna Tell Your Boyfriend (Yeah)
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
Faith is found in the winds
The Planets Are Linin' Up
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all
To Jam [9x]
Hey I ought to leave 
When The World Is On Your Shoulder
And when you finally lose your tender touch
Way in a distant land
I Just Want To Lay Next To You
It tells you never be afraid
Though I'm Begging
I gotta really burn this road
Your just a dog gone!
Stop It!
'Cause if you don't stop
[Akon]
This one’s for all the lost children
He got feet down through his knees
[Bridge (Michael)]
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't take your love
Caring is sharing
Make A Little Space
He's tried
Playing it right
Just a little bit of you every day
One day in your life
As you go your merry way
(They just couldn't take it) 
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
And they have not a clue
This Is Injustice
All the song to me
This Girl I Could Not Trust
Dreaming you're singing to me." 
I'll be forever searching for your love
She's blonde and she's bisexual
Yeah Yeah
My friends come around and now they're gone
Tendoroni You've Got To Be
You torn apart, understand me now? 
Everybody allegation
Come on back to me Maria 
Talkin', Squealin', Spyin'
Dance You Into Day (Sunlight)
Everybody do me
He's got muddy water
Do what you wish, be what you are
Ooh My Sugar
Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme
(Aahh)
We're Bring To You
But tell me, ain't your child
And Secrets So Untold
(Lord have mercy)
Everyday is a holiday
Moving round ha ha
Hot In The Face
And to me that's really true
And the lonely cry fades in the air
What Are The Possibilities
She can't stay in the room
[Refrain]
Can you feel it in the air 
At Night When The
I Said You Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
I Call Your Name . . .
But if Roosevelt was livin'
Don't You
If I could change in a second
I Didn't Call On The Phone To
But I Was Living In Vain
If You Can't Feed Your Baby (Yeah, Yeah)
You Stand)
You're Everything This World Could Be To Me
Oh yes, I did forget something didn’t I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.
Do or dare
(She's doin' it she's doin' it)
You know I'm bad - you know it
I Watched You On The Floor
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
Anywhere you are
And tell me you like what you see
No one to trust
We're almost there
A fall down the stairs
I felt the magic all in the air
Baby come love me
Has turned from a fantasy
There's A Chance For Groovin'
Woe Unto Thee
He wanna do it up keep it high
See I just can’t find the right thing to say
Heal the world we live in, save it for our children
Blazing 'Cross The Evening Sky 
Cause of all the blasphemy
To lie and shame the race
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
Their Needs
And you brought me back to the light
The funk of forty thousand years
You know - you know - shameone
By Saying Let It Be
So you call it trust
It seems as if we have no voice
In despair we'll be the hope
She's Statistical Fact
I Breakdown When I Cry
But I’m keep singing
Something whispers in my ear and says
Woo!
Monster
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you’ve got me nervous yet
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
Though you really wanna fix me
There goes the sunshine
I like the way you move it 
Come together babe
I'm up again I never let you down
You ain't done enough for me
Never Trust-First Impressions
You By My Side
Can’t you see that you will always be
Everybody knows my name
On! Come On!
On the go
Whispers At Morning
She Wants To Give It
I can die in my sleep
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Is destined for history
A burning deep down inside
Morning glow, morning glow
It Only Cares For
Your warning me 
Don't you know?
Stand Up!
Like A Trip To Heaven
Tschada dada dada daa (That’s why I want to be free)
I heard you're packing to leave! 
('Cause When You Close Your
And we'll find them all in time 
Take me by the hand
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
Oh, don't let them 
Home alone
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
You're my only
The midnite hour is close at hand
But not for the missing
You say you wouldn't do it
This World Is Heavenly
Why, 'lone
I've got sunshine
Oh baby yeah Maria 
Keep on reachin' out for me
Dreams don't last forever 
Just want your cut from me
Do it!
(All of the time, here in my heart)
And Your Feet Flat On The Ground
And Uhh, Little Self-Esteem
Cheater...
Everything will be alright, he assures her
Stop it
But that's what makes the world go round
And you my friend will see
What about sunrise
When she was taught that that's not clean
The Mirror,
Hee Hee Hee!
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
Hold Me, Only You And I Can Make Sweet Love This Way
When In Your Presence
Don't leave me girl 
We've Got More Problems
But You're No Damn Good For Me
I Just Want You To
I'm Conditioned By
Each Other
No one understands me
I can't even see!
Some day you are, are mine
So let the performance start 
And the darkness is lighter now
Nobody ever showed her about us
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
They thought they really had control of me
I'll come a-runnin' 
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky 
Monkey business goin' down
Hey Baby Do What You Please
Hey
And This Place Could
Girl when my life got stormy
Roll it
You'll remember the love you found here
Baby the back
Life Ain't So Bad At All (Live Life Off The Wall)
When the cards are wrong
He,d better stop treating you so bad, 
What about children dying
Sit Us Down
It's our planet's womb
[Michael]
Goodbye you today
Word out shockin' all alone
They could print it around the world today
Could never really say goodbye
If you can't get enough
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Of laughter and tears
Keep on with the force don't stop (oh my baby)
There Are No Secrets
In time I knew that love would bring
Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Oh baby you give me butterflies
Like stranger in Moscow
A Strange Woman
Que yo no puedo
Once Believed In
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'
Te quiero y sola
I'm gonna have to put you down Yeah
To Five
Into The Night-Time
No She Acts Like I'm
Let's harmonize all around the world
Can’t we find some love to take this away
When you find that you're always lonely
No there’s a lesson to learn, respect’s not given, it’s earned
Love Is A Feeling
Dare Me
She know your game
The word's got out that you're on the line
I've been so cruel to you 
And She Didn't Leave A Letter
Eat Yo', Get Yo', Hoo! Aaow!
Have you seen my Childhood...
[Both]
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
Hee Hee! Aaow!
Keep on reachin'
My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
Bringing Sparkles To Your Eyes
For higher ground
There's a ghostly smell around
Tu voz me llama
Try to make [?] I was around and y'know
It Ain't Too Much For Me To
In the scheme of life
Then comes the snow
One And 3
Between a million bucks and you
Oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should
Well, After Loving Me, She Said She Couldn't Love Another
Ah But There's No Cure
Make A Better World...
When the sky above you 
Locked your love away from me
You see I never met a girl 
Won't You Stay With Me Until The Mornin' Sun
Too young to understand
I have to tell you
Or Whatever We Do
And how can I stop losing you
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
I Don't Care What You Talkin'
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
Got to be there, got to be there 
There's a tappin in the floor
Get That Sound
Somebody's doin' it to
Your Own
Près du feu de bois
A life so sweet
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it, you know
(Drop a line) 
If you're dealing with God
Aaow!-Hoo Hoo!
You better stop
That You Seduce Every Man
Stories buried and untold
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
Kind Of Love
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
'cause we've got forever
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere
To Know That I Don't Play
Blottie contre toi
(you were struck down)
Change!
She's Got Position
To just be called a part of God
"Michael, I love you
And sweep this whole land through
When I wasn't strong
Oh baby, baby
You know I always will love you, I am forever
Since you seduced her
'Cause We're The Party People Night And Day
That There Are Some With No
My head's in a whirl
Got A Role For Me
Farewell, farewell
Want To See You For Always
Dancin'-Hee!
You must be out of your mind
What about the common man
De santo no tengo nada
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
She Trapped Me In Her Heart
Et danser tout l'hiver
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
Me
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on
[3rd Verse]
[Chorus x 3]
2010 Thriller, there’s nothing iller, it’s killer
Go! Go! Go! Aaow!
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You’re trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
About You Baby
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
That I'm learning a thing or two
Break of dawn, I can see it in your eyes
I need you
and stop talkin' aboout you 
But nobody came to her soon...
Before Your Confidence Will Win Out
(love) 
Two different people
It’s a chance I’ll take, maybe I’ll stay
She says I am the one
Gonna Dance Gonna Burn This Disco Out
Maria come on back to me girl 
Let me love ya for a little while
Stay with me, I want you to stay with me
Yeah
Satin Lace
Every time I wanna say it
I don't want ya 
All this time away
Girl, i think i love you
You'll remember me somehow
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
Da da da da da la da dum 
Yeah, even your darkest night 
And taking its fearful toll
For You're Always In My Heart.
Just think of all the lost children
You rocked my world (Oh...), you know you did
(that he struck you a crescendo Annie)
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again
Should you arrive and it's not there
He one Mojo filter
And We Can Share This Ecstasy
Wonder this time where she's gone 
(say you wanna go far)
Gotta Get To You Baby
You can feel his disease
Takin' Me Higher 
Walking the world together
Yes, happiness
In all of the time le da da dum (Mumble) 
(I Will Be There)
You Can't Close Your . . .Your
And Girl I'll Give You All I Got To Give
I just wanna touch and kiss
You Can Make It Happen
(Hee hee!)
You know where you've been
Every place I go everything I do
(Before You Make)
And now you're gonna get it
Then you better prove you're right
You know the lie, you keep it low
But You're No Damn Lover
Don't You Know Now Is The Perfect Time
Each Time I Do They Kind Of Burn Right Through Me
Gonna take you higher, higher
Well, My Life Ain't
In The Promise Of Another Tomorrow
(Why don't you give me some time)
I know it's you and me
They Said She Had A Breakdown
And It Will Be Soothing
You're Not Like Anybody I Ever Knew
We were not to young at all
It's not warm when she's away 
I Can't Let Her Get Away
(I Can't Be Still You Thrill Me, Baby, Be Mine)
With Not Enough To Eat
Baby I need you
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near
We're talkin' danger
I'm Johnny Raven
Como la brisa
Because It's Just
Don't take your love from me 
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
Someone's Always Doing Someone More
Just Wait And See
(Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na,
But if ever things that have to be
What can make me feel this way? 
You Wont Be Laughing Girl
'Cause It's Dangerous
One blow to the head is all ya need,
No need to worry
Y cuando no estas
In four years catch me with a billon
The week in village...what a thrill
Just to tell you once again,
In our small way
So tell me is it crazy for you baby 
You Got To
You're called the "Just Few"
If I Let Her Get Away
I Can't Deny
Luchando
You got to touch the one you love
I Just Lit A Rocket
Just stop pressurin' me
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
Don't understand it
In Her Pocket
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine
When Morning Awakes Me
How could this be
And where they go nobody knows
(Free like the wind)
Am I invisible because you ignore me?
Sweet, like candy to a child
Money...
Then dial a star
Chcksthtshtshtsh
I know it's you honey baby, yeah
All I wanna say is that
Every child should sing together in harmony
For someone to feel her despair
See, don't you do it baby
You Know How I Feel
Before You Make
The System
while growing, still a child
I'll Be Your Night Lovin' Thing
As the hounding media in hysteria
Day that you'll come back to me
A treasure time won't steal away
and start being without you 
I just want you here with me Maria 
Just when you thought he was done
Drop As A Honeycomb
I Hear Your Voice So
And The Dream We Were
Once all alone
The night's on you
And Get Your Feet Back On The Ground
She showed a photo of a baby crying
Why you stab me in the back? 
(That's Why)
I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom
Gotta Hide Your Inhibitions
'Stead Of Circumstance
Ben, the two of us need look no more
They don't see you as I do
But my friend you have seen nothin'
The law was on her side
And you turned the key
Am I scary for you baby
But can't begin to know the meaning of
So Just Leave Me Alone
Your love is magical, that's how I feel 
I might tell Dad about what I saw
You Really Give It Too Me
[4th verse]
Morning glow is long past due
Now there’s a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned
One minute after the end of time
Then you will hell him
Are closing in to seal your doom
Goin' down babe
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...yeah...ooh)
Just tell me twice and I will see
A Better Place
It's Just Desire
Hee hee!
You Got World Hunger
Black male, black mail
But I Say It Ain't Right
With you?
She Touched Me
Is What A Man's Supposed To Do
And she's always gone too long 
(just like an animal)
(left bloodstains on the carpet)
The Girl Will Be Mine
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Can't Climb Baby
an 18 year old black male..."
Con tu pasion
(I want to be free)
We've Got Drug Addiction
I'm giving you
Because There's Something
On The Phone You And Me
(Fairytales, make-believe and you) 
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
But if you came to see 
I can live, I can breathe
(You are the lady in my life) Let me touch you girl
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
They Say I'm Different
Deep In The Darkness Of
"I Do"
Monster (yea-eah)
You Do This To Me
He say one day you will see
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When she's around me 
Baby I want you
I Cannot Contain Myself
People say I'm not okay
[Verse 1]
Ho...oh...
This is the end of your life
[5th Verse]
Tired of the schemes
If This Town
You can cry on my shoulder... 
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
He innocently questioned why
Any, any, anywhere you are
Pony rides for a dime
He's takin' morphine
Shot me down as cold as ice
You gave me hope when all hope is lost
Just Stop Doggin' Me Around
You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing 
Did you ever stop to notice
No, No, No, She's Mine
And you’re running
And you give me a chance 
It's dead and stuffy in the place
A mother cries
You're nasty
Hold on together, darlin'
We're Gonna Have To Tell Him 
Think of me when you see
[2nd Verse]
Hello , good times
You Got Many Doctors
My father never lies (price of fame)
But they are gunning for the money
[Ad lib fade]
(it was your doom, Annie!)
It's no dreams
A Love So Brand New
With such collusions don't it make you wanna scream
Uh, uh, uh, baby
Now The Weekend's Come It's Time For Fun
To One Town
You sit around in the strangest place
I start try to make it look like I was around
I don't know 
Those abortion papers (Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
I’m everything you need, so tell me what’s the deal
The City's Heart Begins To Beat
The fires deep in his eyes
Well my only fear
Performed before your very eyes 
She's Touchin' Me So To Start
You stayed for the ride
Are you ready for a real good time
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
Love, love, yea
Teachers on strike, no more school today
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
(Lay back in my tenderness) Stay with me
Treacherous, Cunnin', Declinin'
You saw he didn't run
Ooo
I'll Change The Rules For You
You can sing your melody
Grows dark and full of clouds 
To Try To Stop This
I got it coming and it's ecstacy
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant 
That they made...
Make me wanna sing
Don't want to kiss you but I need you
You can be sure of one thing, that’s fate
Eternal (ah eternal) love shines in my eyes (ooh)
I don't wanna fly away
Your Love's Got Me High
What about all the things
(Hee-Hee Hee-Hee).
It's Getting Better All The Time
So don't be feeling no pain boy!
There's no need to dismay
If you're fixing to go
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
Anywhere You Wanna Go
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
She's Composition
And my heart would then be whole
How lucky we are to be me and you
In broad daylight
She wrote "Dear Michael
You know, you know, you know - come on
Make That Change.
Knockin' at your door 
Ain't no good for me babe
(Tell Me)
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Melodie, you're my symphony
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side 
I can't straighten it out, girl, come on
And she, knows they got this to be 
I was wandering in the rain
They don't care
The song of pain and grief across the land
[Michael] Na Na Na Na
Then It Feels That Always
I need us to carry on
To Be
In the devil's game
And see the world with your heart
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad
Young politicians fight for poverty
You Can Be A Winner
Who Is Special In Her Heart
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free 
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold my hand, hold my hand.
Oh, everyday is a holiday
Turn each problem into play
'Cause I just can't take it
And I'll Be Workin'
So tell me is it scary for you baby
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
Acha-Ooh!
Just beat it, beat it
Make my heart keep turn
She changed her name
Y de diablo lo tengo todo, ay de todo
My life is so complete
This time around yeah
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
Got It Kicking Of The Back
Would die for you
Tell Him (Woo Hoo)
No You Won't See Her Kiss
Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Will surely keep the doctor away
And Frustrations
It’s the way that I love you, let me show you I’m your man
Don't let it get you down, oh no
It was blood on the dance floor
No hay quien me de lo
Everybody watching the news on Michael Jackson
Keep on with the force don't stop (love power)
All through the night
I've got the month of May
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)
Where do your loyalties lie?
We're destined to screw ourselves one blow
And I'll Take You There
So goodbye with all my prayers
Things always missin'
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
Pick up and let them walked away
I Can't Take This Stuff No More
If you can't answer 
Ooh Stop Trippin'
Satisfied
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
In the morning 
You Know, Girl
The Girl I Could Not Trust
Got to make somebody
If They Say -
I reached for the sky
Michael Jackson, R.I.P.
Who Can't Write Or Read
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
[Chorus]
You know I really do hate to say it
Am I scary for ya
Tschada dada dada daa
Talmud Song
But I Learned Too Late
And the whole world has to answer right now
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Maybe it could be my friends
Float Across The Sky, High
[Ad Libs Out]
Of No Return
Too bad, forget it
Before we learn to live as brothers
That you pledge your only son...
Of What My Life's Supposed To Be (Well)
(Keep doin' it keep doin' it)
It's too much
(You are the lady in my life)
Your Heart
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
The world keep on spinning does the future know? 
(Always the lady in my life) I love you I love you I need you I want you, baby
You know we'll never see
And How You're Livin' Each Day
Got to be there 
For every day to start
How good to be happy and free
Don't go no where
It's Only Gonna Happen Again
You're gonna leave her one too many times
So when the going gets rough
That Got Away
Baby Be My Girl
I Don't Care What You Say
So don't you monkey shy with me
Like You Understand
Biding your time
Do You, Do You
Home with me
Oh yes I will, yes I will 
So Get On The Floor And Dance With Me 
Beating her voice in her doom
We need each other,
(You can cry on my shoulder) 
I was alone, there was no love in my life
Did God say that you could decide?
When you're not on top
You really want it
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)
If You Wanna Make The World
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme
Notre amour brillera dans ce monde
Will You Still Care?
Since I Met Her From The Start
Gotta fever in your shoes
I'll Show My Brotha
You Know . . .That Man
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries
Because of you, oh yeah
When you find that you're always waiting
Another drug baby
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
Grab a song and come along
Who's bad
She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
But when you lend my mind
Don't Let Nobody Take You Down
And We'll Keep You Movin', That's For Sure
You know me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Deseos de vivir,
I'm gonna fly
Don't you ever call!
I'm in love with a beautiful girl 
How can I begin to say
Who left my heart in pieces
A heart attack baby
I Have The Stuff That You Want
She said to keep your mind on dancing
The evil of the thriller
Juste one more step
Hee! Hee! Hee! Hoo! Hoo!
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
I Am The Dead
Any Pearl
They thought they really could control me
You stripped me of my dreams
[Spoken]
What do you get?
I don't wanna see you in mysery, so come on, baby come on
[CHORUS 2]
Do You Remember
I can’t explain, I’m all alone
And when that flag blows
It's going on baby
So I've got to be there 
But like a two-edged sword
Shalalala boom boom
(aah) (pah dah dah)
With A Fever, But Nothing He Found
He wanna hot scrub
We're gonna change the world, girl
Insurance?
Every single moment that we spend apart
Throw your brother in jail
You are the sun
But The Power That Love Has To Make It Right
I Could Feel The Aura
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
And Though I Find Myself Attracted To You
I was the clown
Like The Loss Of Sunlight
She Likes The Way I Stare
And bring all your troubles to me. 
I'm Gonna Make A Change
Gonna Groove Gonna Move Ya
Than We'll Ever Need
The moment I know she loves me 
[ad-libs]
It's not my thing trying to get back
You Got Strange Diseases
And takin' morphine
Even though we both know
The Way You Make Me Feel
You Can't Hurt Me
You'll remember one day . . . 
(Oooh!)
by and by
He's got Joo Joo eyeball
Keep The Faith, Baby, Yea
Your Ticket Right
Problem Here
Fear Or Dread
Though we're far apart
I don't even wanna say it
The painful youth I've had
Asking me to come
There's Something
And make my mother smile... 
All we have to do
Pero siento que
With the world greatest
Oh Maria you sweet little sunflower 
In my eleventh hour
Makes It Makes It Right
(Abortion paper)
Babe, Hee!
[6th Verse]
You're sellin' out souls but
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin’ love
This Love Will Be Reality (Ah Ah)
You used to love me
Todo mi amor eres tu ...
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
See now why
I love you madly
'Cause you're not there
And What You Doin' Right Now
Do anything for news
Winds of change are set to blow
I'm gonna be in misery 
'Cause you really can't control me
You're Just Another Part Of Me
With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
Let's dance dance with me 
Sittin' round tellin' how he did it to you
But I Say It Ain't Right If I Can't Give Sweet Love To You (Well, Ah)
Please don't disappear
Is the Greatest Show on Earth
Man, That Man
Give me your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Into each life some rain falls
There's blood up on the stairs
'Cause If It's Aching
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
(Go'on now)
I Knew Right Then And There
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
So Make A Better World
I'd change for you like that
What do you think of that
And call my name out loud 
She never cut baby
one man can claim
But I Was Too Blind To See
Don’t you, don’t you like it
She's looking for the hope in the empty promises
One Thing In Life
(Then Tell Me, Just What
Now Baby-Hee!
(Take my time wherever I go)
To win the fame baby
But We Both Cannot Have Her
You Know-I've Got To Get
no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here 
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Your doggin' me around
Shameone
Midnight rider
I feel their envious looks at me
Tu me haces sentir
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
I love a notion
'Cause I'm Real Tired You See
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
Someone is taking a life, hold on
With you? 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 
I don't understand it!
How many people have to cry
Ugh!
All your glory
If I had my way girl
Yesterday you had his trust
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
[Background]
But together we can be alright (alright, yeah)
[2nd Verse (Paul)]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
That you give me strong hot fever
If You Cared Enough
Just let God decide
Oh, I’ll never let you go, come here girl
Though you don't need me now
The band start to play
Now Baby's Slowly Dyin'
I won't be complanin'
(Message To You)
I close my eyes
'Cause We Got So Far To Go
To tell you how I feel 
Hoo! hoo! hoo!
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You can never break me
There's a ghost down in the hall
A Summer's Disregard,
'Cause The Will Has Brought
The flowers will grow
Till Dawn, Two Or Three
The thing you see
Does he send letters to the FBI?
And treasure the sums
What about all I pray
Doin' it on the highway, gotta have it my way
If They Ask Her
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"
Look for the rainbow in the sky
Give It To The Feeling
(Mind)
Keep nasty
Talkin' 'bout my girl
People can be so cold 
Without you darling my life is through 
Look In The View Mirror
With No Clothes On Their Back
No Message Could Have
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right 
[CHORUS 1]
Uhh!
Girl, I Need To Hold You
So D.J. Spin The Sounds
'Cause Love For Us Was Meant To Be (Well)
Us Growing
and what will she say? 
(yee-aah, why are stalking me)
Chorus (Michael)
I need your body
All You Need Is The Will To Want It
Our love's in motion
It's here inside 
Everyday I sit and ask myself
Who's Laughing Baby, Don't
Love, love, love
Heart)
If you don't stop
We Stop Existing And
Doing it right
A monster had arrived in the village
Looking In My Mirror
I read the paper
So Tonight Gotta Leave That Nine To Five Upon The Shelf
I Don't Care Anyway
Just To Make It Right
And again, and again, and again...
Et si ca stoppe
Is That What She Said
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
I'm from a world
If I can show you baby
It’s just the things I do
(Speed demon)
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"
They really wanna fix me, hit me
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Just come into my arms
You can look at them coming out the walls
And it told her out tonight
A Possibility Of More To Come
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
(Take You Anywhere)
Love To Run My Fingers
See, you
Healthly and clean
Look who just walked in the place
Have you seen my Childhood?
I've moved and make you cry
We'd Stare
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror
My life began when Happy smiled
Breakdown
There's something you should know
I Love You Liberian Girl,
With The Eyes Of Desire
The sweetness of your kiss
God forsake it 
Oh what a feeling there'll be 
Why don't you just scream and shout it
[2nd Verse (Patti Austin)]
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Who have the grateful?
And you're fighting the wars
You're doin' wrong
world)
It's Aching, Make It Feel Alright
See The Nations Turn
I Never Felt So In Love Before
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Situation, speculation
We can't take it
Don't Point Your Finger
Refrain
Up again I never let you down
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
Just remember I will always be around 
(Heal Me And Bathe Me)
You're a parasite in black and white
[Michael] I'll Take You There
But She Never Shows
Anything's in your powers
With A Song
I don't understand it
Some, some, some, some, day 
[Written by John Lennon]
Then I will sell him
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
I Love You So Much
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time
When This Is Over
You're fighting to survive inside a killer, thriller tonight
On my thought yeah yeah
Baby yeah...
But in your presence I am lost for words 
my life (Searched for all my life)
This is for all the lost children
Y me hace feliz
I'd like to take you places
I Swear There's Something
(Carry Me Boldly)
Everybody's somebody's fool
Everywhere you seem to turn
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
Tellin' Lies And Rubbin' Shoulders
Gon' Keep It Sister
(There's A Time When You're
Life is just a thing you don’t
Slam dunk ha ha ha
And You Can Say The Words
Give me all your loving
I wanna come home again
Now that you are here
Love is like a circus and a carnival is beautiful to see
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe
You're taking morphine
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Cause I'm On Fire
tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
I Was At The Point 
Deep down in my soul, Baby
The feeling of terror
Just Like In The Movies,
How will I make it when it's gone 
(Rock me with your sweet caress)
Everything we're lookin' for
Dead or alive
Ooh My Honey
I Wait For The Day,
Morphine!
Ways
I just want you to take me, take me
I Gave Her Promises
Écoute-moi mon amour
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
(Your smile is scary)
Like You Are My Brother
Tell Him What He Needs To Know
Shake Your Body Won't You G'on Get Down...
What about the seas
Come on take me please
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Just because you read it in a magazine
Keep on with the force don't stop (keep on with the power)
You write the words to destroy like it’s a weapon
Promise me we'll always be
robbery suspect. The man was
Kicking me down
Better off being together (hold my hand)
But oh so sad when it ends
Is where your space is
Yeah, 
She's from a world
Foolish of me, I couldn't see 
The thrill for the money
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,
Darling, ooooh, oooooooh yes, yes you can girl... 
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
I Gave Her Time
Say That I'm Alright
He dares to be recognized
But first I need your hand
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
And Get Your Mind On Track
Though you're gone star far away
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,
[7th Verse]
No matter where I go or what I do
Watching you when you sleep, when you’re in bed
You're not a man
I Can't Help But See You
Why are they never satisfied with all you give, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Hot love
Though It's Plain To See
Monkey see, monkey do
Kick me, kike me
Love that will endure
Those abortion papers
What's my life without you girl 
When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
Once You Get The Beat Inside Your Feet
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
And I wanna make it up to you
We Can Change All The World
(Ha!)
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
I Don't Wanna
I made one more try
And Though I'm Trying Not To Look In Your Eyes
With a child's heart
This happened much too soon
The light through the window
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
Oh
So Baby, Be Mine, Baby, Be Mine
Tomorrow
Live Your Life Off The Wall (Live It Off The Wall)
Love is all we need
What do you want from me?
You Know . . .
That We'd Live Our Life As One
Liberian Girl . . .
And I’m singing to keep from feelin’ blue
You Can't Neglect It
My friend, my someone in the dark was you
And no one ever told me
I can dance I can shake it baby (He can dance)
there’s a monster
That you send along, signed with all your love 
Gotta Have It My Way
I need her sharing her world beside me 
Then you will swear it
The Girl Is Mine (Mine, Mine, Mine)
And a man is out tonight
Then forever can begin
Sayin' that she got it good
Go on, babe
Of the truth in chapters of our minds
Que das tu
And A Day We'd Live As One
You Are My Choice Now
You know I work to hard for this kinda play, 
That’s why you’ve got to be threatened by me
Join The Party
