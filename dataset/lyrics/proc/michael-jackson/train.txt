But she left me for another man
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Shake Your Body Won't You G'on Get Down
Want To See An Exhibition
Is it really over
Frame him if you could
The cake and the crumbs
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
For Now We'll Make
La vérité pour moi
Close your eyes and drift away
Tschada dada dada daa [x2]
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
I’m singing for so very long
See That Girl
I will answer all your prayers
I still remember
You are the sun in the Southern sky, when things are shaded
You Must Understand
You kill for the money
We Can Dim The Lights
At Night Till Dawn
Over You... Over You (All Night)
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey
And ya try to make a way to see, what it is i do,
For Now We'll Make A Vow
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
And I’m singing crying helplessly
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando
Invaded by shadows
Bring your loving and nothing else
Joyful Giving
Then Why Do We Keep
Girl you've given him all you had
Morning glow fill the earth
Hoo Hoo!
(Goin' on now)
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Takin' Me Higher
You're doin' it
But they say the sky's the limit
If You Can Get It
You'll Never Make Me Stay
Softly While You Sigh
You never said goodbye
Oh happy day
It make me feel like... oooh!
People laugh when they're feelin sad
Who Promise
'Cause ooh... 
It's Time To Come Alive
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
Take)
Like You've Never Seen
All the bad songs of the night
If You Want To Know Why
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller
Is Just An Apple
You'd crucify the Lord
You gonna play this
When knowing in my heart
And nothing would cheer you
Let me keep you warm
Like A Perfect Flower
Me Girl
But I'm Only Human
Like music, music and me
All your troubles to me
(Softly Then Boldly)
Their Swords
Are you OK Annie?
Set Me Free
Haz que me quiera
[Michael] I Said Na Na Na Na Na
She's Probably Worried
You are there
'Cause There's A Chance For Choices
Hot Damn
(Holy Mary moly Mary)
That She's My Girl Forever And Ever
(Softly You Say To Me)
Susie ain't your friend
Just because you're there, 
I was lost in a world of strangers
Through your fear and sorrow
You took away the fear
It Ain't Too Much
Is if there was a girl at all
(pah dah dah dah dah)
(Can't afford to waste it) 
I don’t want nobody else to hold you
Give me a motion 'cause
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love can turn your mind around like ferris wheels and spinning carosels
Come Go With Me
But summer's gotten away from us
Within Myself
She's Just A Lover
The heavens are falling down
And She Promised Me In Secret
(Yeah!-Make That Change!)
No Excuses To Make
Now With Michael
To get the story you need, so you can bury me
It's so insane
Look at me now
I need your love in my life
Even the flowers and lollipops
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See, I
A Rather Nation
...I really wanted to do
Waiting for you to find me
Come so easy
Next to me yeah yeah
She Just Up And Ran Away
Bet you sell your soul
(Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
Does It Lead You Home
But who knows just what the future brings
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh, Wooh, Wooh)
That We're Gonna Raise The Roof Off Soon
And Don't You Pretend 
She came and stood right by me
De madrugada
Hit me, kick me
And show her that she is my girl 
She felt as a youth
Remember
You're so reliable
But girl, you know it's true
(Ya Know)
If You Care Enough
Can you dig it? 
Oh.. it always ends up this way
He's awaken, ground is shakin
And Nothin' Gonna Stop Me
Waits for you elsewhere
There's something in the walls
(Want that dime)
That’s all I pray
Will me, thrill me
They'll hurt you and desert you 
I guess you'd say
First I Cooled Like A Fan
Someone tell me why
You've got no reason to frown
He got kicked in the back
I love you
C'mon And Groove, And Let The Madness In The Music Get To You
Have time to come true
Is truth a game daddy
A real life traffic stopper
Don't Say To Me
Anytime she goes away
I Feel You Are All
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say
In My Turbulence
Recognize Me
Every Moment Takes Me To Paradise
Help Me Sing It, Ma Ma Se,
The light from the window
For A Favor
Take my hand, don't let go, baby, hold me (yeah)
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Armageddon of the brain
it cuts you and it stabs me
That twinkle at night
From Miles Around
Drop a line sometime, yeah
Move to the left
I don't care a jack, or about what cha' do, 
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
That Looks Can Fool You
This love I have for you girl it’s incredible
And then think of my blues!
Confusions Contradict
Are you ready for a real good treat
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Pour la première fois
Don't Let 'Em Get In Your Way
With each passing day
You go through life making fools of others
You rocked my world, you know you did
'Cause you are there, 
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
The things that would show that they cared for you
I don't know why baby!
Sunset Driver
Don't You Get In My Way
And Susie says its right
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
A Touch, A Kiss
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!
How To Do The Thing Right
To Touch A Stranger
[Verse 2]
(Don't let it get you down) 
Our Love Is Dawning
Don't make a fight
That didn't make it
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Lay your body close to mine
For Once In My Life
Oh girl, I really hurt you 
You Cannot Waste It
She Got It Ready
Ain't no stop and go
Who Am I, To Be Blind?
'Til the end of time
[ad lib to fade]
Their lunacy shade
Gotta, The Peace Of Mind No
animal, hannibal, cannibal addition
Where your blood comes from
when your children cried last night?
Give In To Me
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind
Vivir sin tu amor
It seems to me
Don't be callin' down babe
Before I put it in
I Touch Her Shoulder
I'm on my way back to you
Have we lost their trust
Break of dawn
So don't be feeling this way
The moon is the enemy
Sister don’t know, where would she go
(Washed-Out Dream)
Too young to really be in love
I got it coming baby
Tout te donner
Through the shadows of the night
"Do You Love Me"
(Feel you with the sweetest love) Let me be your baby
Making for my selfish pride
We shal have rhyme
Oooh, you are there, 
Because
Like A Castle
In The Jungle
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray 
You help me understand
My heart cries out for your tuch
Hello tomorrow
Darlin', Let Me Hold You
Do What You Want To Do
Never can feel
I Am The Agony Inside
And give you all the love I have inside
I need your light right here today
You gave me strength
Take my hand, don't let go, baby, hold me (hold me)
Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Before you loose your heart
I can't believe the things I see
We're so gonna loose 
I like the way how you're kissin' me,
If they're for peace, why is there war?
There Ain't No Way To Stop You Movin' Good
Everybody sing...
No hay felicidad
There's A Chance For Dancin'
That's with you baby
Where a restless soul is going
Ooh! I Love You Baby, I Want
(Cause we're almost there) 
Cos when he's in your arms
She should have spied under his skin
A mystery so sullen in air
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?
She's Got The Look
I'm gonna answer your letter
They Eat Off Of You, You're A Vegetable
It's Time That I Realize
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Diana Walked Up To Me,
I See The Kids In The Street,
So every night I say a prayer
I'll never forget you
No one's sleeping
You can't run away, past the said and done
And It Doesn't Seen Right
What about love?
Your my lady and I love your girl
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I couldn't believe it
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Brother's in curse
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself
I can't make it without you
Gonna give you loving
There's something you ought to know
Suddenly the sun shines for a while 
Dang gone it, baby!
There'll be no more wars
Know
But we took our chances
You Stand
I still feel the need for you
All the girls have bringhten now
Get your tickets right away
I'm so lonely I'm so blue 
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
This Passion Burns
No, Baby
And then someday they may recall
It don't matter if you're black or white
Alone at last
Your Love So Complete
We'd Live A Love So True
A world of sweet harmony
You're A Vegetable, You're A Vegetable
Love Is A Woman
Into Plowshares
Why Don't You Come With
The Girl Was Bad
I'll start beginning with the ABC's of loving you
And bring all your troubles to me
(Blood on my side)
Hee Hee! Ooh!
Words like, "I love you."
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
You give them your all
Gonna Dance 'Til We Burn This Disco Out
Get Your Ticket Right
Call on me... call on me
To Get There
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly
Is killing me inside
But You Got To Keep The Faith Gon'
The Truth Of Lust
I'm Gonna Make A Change,
Dirty Diana, No
At That I Ran To The Phone
(Leave Me Alone)
If heartache's what you want
And you’re running just to escape it
I don't wanna go away
Just sign your name on the line baby, I own you 
She's The Scene
The World Keeps Changing    
I'm in love 
Darkness falls across the land
And there's nothing I can see
She was there just sitting at the table
Don’t get so confused
I found heartache instead
“Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine.”
Life Ain't So Bad At All If You Live It Off The Wall
Turns your dreams around
Here One Day
And My Confessions
The world is out
They want more money but the board won't pay
You can never kill me
I Need You Night And Day
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
Get On It
Today
Not Enough To Eat
Mysteries Do Remain
(Whoa...oh...oh...)
Girl you're so together
Because She's Mine
You are there like the laughter of a child 
We Have The Truth
Who will dance on the floor in the round
Mike's So Relaxed
(Lay Your Head Lowly)
You've got a friend 
Because we care we love enough to share
We're Takin' Over
My Back
Sayin' Baby I'm Alright
Lift Up Your Head
Streetwalking baby
Party now
There's a ghost out in the hall 
Just Take It Slow
That Makes Me Want
Too much of that, fuse blown
He came into her apartment
An' congregate, illuminate
Reaching Out
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax
Anything now
You're just a liar
Where else numbers two
Tender Lovin' Care
Create A World With
Oh yeah-yeah, you better
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
From one more violent crime
I've got to be free, baby!
You might see me cry
Like A Comet
Da de de da de da da dum 
You know you're scaring me too 
My World
From Sun Up To Midnight
For No Favors
Baby come love me 
But Her Inner Spirit And Words
I'll come home to you
I am the one who came when you fell down
There’s imagination I bet you've never been there before
You should have started long ago
(Man In The Mirror-Oh
My happy arms will hold you
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
And when you're gone she'll know
Hear It
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
(Keep on goin')
Friday's brighter
The Dying Head
Cinderella, stay awhile
The girl that now is dead
I broke my radiator,
(Ah)
We're Sendin' Out
The Hurt Came Back At Me
I ain't scared of your brother
For Those Who Have Prestige
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start
When it's all gonna end
To Stay
And Dance With Me
She Doesn't Kiss And Hug Me
A nightmare, that’s the case
(Man In The Mirror, Oh Yeah!)
Love Me Like A Mother
But never two lovers
Can’t you see, I don’t wanna walk away
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Faces fill with madness
We Could Fly So High
Hurt the sheets
Got Fire In My Pocket
[x2]
Don't make it factual, actual
It's A Promise So Untrue
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it 
What about all the peace
Father left home, poor mother died
We Were Young
You wanna party
'Cause I love such elementary things,
Well they say the sky's the limit
There
Don't You Wanna Know? My

'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
I Wanna Groove With You
Will Be Tonight
[Rap]
Don't you send him, just come yourself
Don't you wrong or right me
It's gonna to kill me
Because we love, I know
Yes, we're one and the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
She Left Me Standing Alone
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
I'd Rather Leave The Fantasy Of What Might Be
living your live as Heaven
Oh oh Hollywood just making it clearer
Creatures crawl in search of blood
(He's Johnny Raven)
You keep me so upset
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine
Through all your lies and silly games 
Oh, girl please don't leave me
The mother-in-law
For her singing the tune
Are you OK, Annie?
[P.Y.T.'S] Na Na Na Na Na
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . . . 
Now she started finger popping to the beat
Touch Me
But the kid is not my son
And We'll Paint The Town
Thar was waiting there
Knowing I was lost and passed away
Neglection can kill
Cause your God is such
We shall have music
(Ooh girl let me keep you warm) I wanna give you all
And My Tribulations
Trust in me
That's one word for heaven
Won’t go, without her I’d go crazy
They've gotta hear it from you
A hold on me
I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom 
Girl I won't forget you
And I won't give up the fight
Morning glow is here at last
Things will go better if you just hold my hand (yeah)
She plays a game with such an innocent face 
MJ number 1, it’s goes on and on
(Girl)
Susie's got your number 
Lift her with care
That when she's with me, she's home 
The Girl Is Wasting Over
Swift and sudden fall from grace
And now you do regret it
We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Will Reveal A Joyful Face
Got A Feelin'
Through My Fear
Fight the circumstance,
(Oh)
And Fight Till The End
To A Place That You Only Dream Of
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 
He shoot Coca-Cola
Right)
Come to me, let me be your one and only (one and only)
Oh! Oh! Oh . . .Oh . . .
Relax
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Now you're wearing a badge
You made my life brand new
Just to tell you once again
Tell me girl, it's not to late 
[P.Y.T.'S] Na Na Na
Is that your alibi?
'Cause the power's deep inside my soul
(he left the bloodstains on the carpet)
Torn apart by creed
You know the stranger is you
J'aimerais prononcer que toi, que toi
Any Road That You Take
(Life's long hard climb) 
[RAP ]
Let Us Down
Got to be there
Got to have some loving
Don't understand it!
See the evil one is you
No one to care
There's a creak beneath the floor 
There Ain't No Way That Your Gonna
by and by (By and By)
Sister say she love him some
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're living much too fast
I'm a get down dancin man
It's up to me and I'm still alive
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
And no one told her why
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone, you know
So paparazzi, get away from me
The Life You Save Could Be
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now
I thought the grass was green on the other side
And leave my world so cold
A Vow To Just
I can taste it
Feeling the world standing still
She Love Me, She Love Me,
You know we'll never part
"Why have you come from the West?
Rearranging Minds
Shot an arrow in me!
Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Why his mother had to die
Bad news, bad news! 
You broke my heart into half
If I don't come up, number one
(You've got a place to go) 
You are there when the night's in town
But See What Will I Do!
She's Mine, She's Mine
Pull Over Boy And
Hit The City Lights
And Hold You
Those abortion papers (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
You're throwin' stones
If the angels came for me I’d tell them no
(She Wants To Give It)
In the lost and found of my heart...
I dont know 
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
Lovely, is the feelin' now
She pulls up the covers
That always bothers me
Step right up its circus time and get your moneys worth of love today
He’s an animal
I need you now
Is the greatest show on earth (yea e yea)
Girl, if you take your love away from me 
[Carlos Santana:] Thank you, man!
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
(Ooh girl let me keep you warm)
They don't really care about us
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
Tonight’s story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way
(God is jammin')
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
[VERSE 1]
Someone called out my name
Tired of you tellin' the story your way
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
he’s keeping you down like a monster
This time around you're making me sick
Maria it's been long so long 
Some things in life they just don't wanna see
My cup over runneth with the fullness and grace
With That Man In The Mirror
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
Do it do it, he can do it, watch him do it
Call on me, call on me 
3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
Not set, the pace for style
The future can't hold what your money can't buy
The Baby Boom
They Follow The Pattern Of
So Baby, Be Mine (Baby You Gotta Be Mine)
Don't be goin' down babe
You better run, you better do what you can
I Told My Brother
I had to work baby
Just the other night
If I had a chance to choose
Just to pursue her movie star dreams
I'm living lonely
It's going down baby
Your grandma's house was next to mine
He one spinal cracker
Things look up just having you around
Feel So Sorry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
Maria why d'you keep a-running away 
I Gotta Really Burn This Road
Don't tell me you agree with me
Places we once shared
(Lift Me)
I gotta be where you are
When Nobody Else Is Talkin'
I Love The Way You Shake That Thing Girl Especially 
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
Who's to trust when living dangerous
How It All Began
Trading In The Passion For That Taste Of Pain
Tahitian tanned
We don't need it...
But What Is Love Girl
His Ways
People... 
Monkey Business goin' down
But who can stand when she's in demand
(A friend) 
Don't Come Beggin'
But I Hate Sleepin' Alone
I don’t know where we’re going
'Cause You Got To Keep The Faith
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh
Of conquest and kings on the throne...
Ain't Nobody's Business But
Catch me in a bad mood, flippin’ you’ll take a whippin’
To make my father proud
Did he say to either do it or die?
Uh, Uh, Uh
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams
What Will I Do? Uh . . .Ooh . . .
You don't believe me then
He got hair down to his knees
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
Givin' Me
Just wait 'til I get through
Still I Cry Alone At Night
(Why did you, why did you)
Right till the end, for you 
Stay here and love me just a while
Yeah Shoo-hee
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
When We First Met Girl
Someone touching your face
Can't you hear them cry
But that's the way you cry girl (Cry girl)
[Fade-Out/Repeat]
I don't know
He's got Ono sideboard
He’s coming at ya
Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na,
The world could not go on so every night I pray
Now I've Learned That Love Needs Expression
Taking you away from here
But nobody's sitting there
I Said My Baby's At Home
Be in two places at the same time
No one wants to be defeated
I wanna fall with you again
I've got all the riches baby
Je te dirai tout bas
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when 
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
(The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me)
Quiero estar junto a ti
It asks no questions why (ooh)
So There's Really No Time
And this house just ain't no home 
And soon I'll be there to brighten up 
Your dog's a bitch baby
Cause we're almost there
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
Well lord have mercy
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
Those abortion papers (Hoo!)
(he came into your apartment)
I'm gonna be 
Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl
To hide your hands
'Cause You Can
You just a rival
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
He say "One and one and one is three"
She innocently questioned why
I Need To Find The Truth
[BRIDGE]
That Man, That Man, That Man
Feel The Heat Feel The Beat Rock You Into Day (Sunlight)
(Lay back in my tenderness)
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Walkin' Into Darkness
A Whisper Of Love
But It's Okay
The City Winks A Sleepless Eye
[Michael (sample)]
Being miserable alone (hold my hand)
Very Same One
You'll do anything for money...
that girl I can't take her 
Touch Me There
I will love you more each day
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
I just couldn't believe it
If I was dead broke and smokin'
(But that's the way you cry)
So young and so fair
I try to find the truth
You made your words sound so sweet
Give me a reason 'cause
So, Annie, are you OK?
I guess you'll say
You put a knife in my back,
Don't Play The Fool For The Rest Of Your Life
La guerre éclater
Na Nah
(Hold On)
Just can't break it
That I've been lookin' for
Guide you to the light babe
(Just Stop Doggin' Me)
You don't care
Can you dig it?!
Woo! Woo! Woo!
Can't we set him free
See how cryin' has left its trace
(Rock me with your sweet caress) And I love you baby
But I am speechless, speechless 
Got a hold on me
[Rap Performed By Heavy D]
I am a friend through thick and thin
Somebody killed little Susie
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
You really got a hold on me, yeah
So Give Yourself  A Chance
For The Living
Hour Like
[Spoken:]
I want you to... 
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Across The Morning
Now why
You've been so true 
Press play, don’t stop, rotate, too hot
You Say That Workin' Is What A Man's Supposed To Do 
The Wind, Ya' See
(Michael Michael) 
Oh No, No No . . .
[Chant]
"A man has been brutally beaten to death by
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl
Suspended between time and space
Listen, I've got problems of my own
Going town
We're here to simulate, eliminate
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 
No one's sleeping(no-one's lovin')
Keep doing what you do
That's Why I'm Starting With
When will this mystery unfold
And It Cuts Like A Knife
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
It was the sound of a crescendo
Could It Be Really Me,
I Thought She Had To Have It
Like a child so gay and so carefree
Oh father, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it
[CHORUS x 3]
Cause you're always there in my dreams
That's the new word for today
So unreliable
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe
To Make A Better Place...
With A Child's Heart
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Hand in hand where dreams never end
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
Sadness had no choice but to flee
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
In the morning, in the evening
People make the world go round...
I'd probably be by my lonesome
Too-My Love)
With My Man
I just wanna touch you
Love Came And Possessed You
And If I Stop . . .
Go face the worries of the day
And I can't believe what's goin' round
(Is It Just A Lie)
If You Take The Chance And Do It
To show that he cares
As long as I know you'll be there, girl
(Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh) 
Woo, Ooh Baby
Aaow
Ce que je ressens
Too bad, oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should
Y sabes tambien
Fulfill The Truth
Think you said this feeling is your life
Girl, When You Dance
When all the words keep turning down
(do think twice.)
He be waiting with his camera right on focus
She... I dah dah dah dah dah 
Alone she lays waiting
She Called My House
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Police Brutality
What did these soldiers come here for?
[Chorus (1)]
'cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
To always do my best
If you give me a hand
You know Susie says its right
Well I guess you'll say
Or let it be...
To Think For Two Years She Was Here
You think it's okay
Together We'll Cry
Tu me rends folle
But instead of tendeness
Maria I need you 
Kicking it loose
You Best Just Leave Them Alone
You're not here with me
You Kiss Me Then,
Hee, Gonna change the world, Ooo
Que nadie te querra
Woman To Man
Ain't No Mountain That I
Running Often Through My Mind
And Forever We'll Be True
and there's no way you'll ever get to me 
And I can hear her calling me.
Let sadness see what Happy does
Maria after all you were the only one 
Mother's preaching Abraham
Although a tear may be ever so near
I'm Asking Him To Change
A human presence that you feel is strange
When she says hello to the world 
This Feeling's So Strong
I Don't Wanna Hear It
[CHORUS 3x]
If I had a nickel for everytime
Just to tell you once again, 
Talk On The Phone
In love for an instant
'Til you break those ties that bind 
You hate your race baby
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
Listen Up, Hee . . .We've Got A
Keep it goin'
Let them all materialise
All The Time
Got to get your love
(Who Is It?)
(Bye, bye) 
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)
How did love slip away
The ups and downs a carousel
Tired of injustice
Will I Do)
Now Who Is Sorry Now
And some day I'll know that moment divine

Still crying, tell me what should I do.
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Like It's The Last
So Come And Go With Me
Sure Appreciate
'Cause girl, you came and changed
They just couldn't take it
Oh hear my plea for sympathy 
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Hold you in his arm 'til

I don't listen to a word they say
Flying high like a man on a trapeze
Stop being without you 
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)
I Don't Want It
We Could Really Get There
You just sit around just talkin' nothing
Tell me where were you
If you ever look behind
Tell 'Em That We're Just
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
There's a rocking in the chair
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Got to be there in the morning 
You're out of time
But baby, you're not there
She works in a restaurant night and day,
Baby, don't take your love from me
Strange Inhumanity
To lead our hearts astray
If you can't answer
Gonna, gonna put you down
The government won't pay my taxes
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
It Ain't 
I Love You
Make The Move
Paint the town so pretty
We're as close as two friends can be
Let nothin' in the world darlin'
Want your pot of gold
Watching people lose their lives
You really wanna get me
For no mere mortal can resist
Everybody Just Get On Down
I’d turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Gonna tell you right
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground 
Love you
They'd swear you're a hippy if you have long hair
Or just confusing you 
[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]
I told you
All Day Long
Together they gather
Not alone ohh
Satisfy The Feeling
Exactly what you gonna see 
Swim The Deepest Sea, Hee
Go!
Circulate the lie you confiscate
We'll make it through
To be the stranger

You've Got To
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers
When it's cold outside

Father always told me,
I've got the fastest feet around
Be careful what you say don’t overload
Will You Come And Take Me
(Free like the wind babe)
Liberian Girl
What about death again
Maybe you and I can't do great things
Understand
I can't believe that is real
Love was always here waiting for me
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
I'll be there
Some day my happy arms will hold you

A Love So True . . .
Et pouvoir t'embrasser
From love that I cannot hide
But I'm home free for no thrills

Holy Mary Mercy me
And baby through the years even when we're old and gray

My mouth might let it be
And When The Groove Is Dead And Gone (Yeah)
No Fortune

Someone in the dark for me!
only for me, then spoke with her body 
It may seem strange I know
Nobody should be grievin' this way (oh-oh)
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
Every hero dreams of chivalry
(Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
And I told about equality
To Your Alibis
Baby I've got what it takes 
Mi vida no es vida
My joy had turned to pain
Livin' Crazy That's The Only Way
To Cry
seems like you'd know by now 
Ooo...
So unaware of the lonelyness
Euphoria never to feel frustration
Will fade into the past
(Hee Hee!)
Kicked in the face baby
[Michael Jackson]
I always gave you good thing
And you have to say you looked at me
They'd do me for the money
See, it's not about races
Signed in your name against the words of God
He brushed himself off
Ah take me back
A hot buzz baby
I'm Headed For The Border
You say it's not a sword
Back to where I should have always stayed
No broken bridges
You're my daytime my nighttime
You tell me I'm wrong
You have to show them that you're really not scared
Then Tell Me Just What
I Hear Your Voice Now
Y sabas tambien
I don't want you but I need you
And everything I own I give
Who's Laughing Baby-Don't

A Broken Bottle Top
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
Straighten Out Your Life
Maria since you've been gone 
I can't take it much longer
Let us walk down the park, makin’ love ‘til it’s dark
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
Anything for money
Just places
('Cause we're almost there) 
Is it scary for you baby 
You Got To . . .
When you came to see your grandma in may
Now I wake up everyday

And leave one family oh...
Right Away Won't You Baby
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Scratch My Shoulder
You'll Never Tell

Like a knife in your soul
Oh, no
Beautiful morning
You And Me In Spain

Big girls ain't supposed to cry,

Though She Acts Like I'm Not
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
I’m telling you, when you lie under a tomb
Keep your head up, tonight!
I've raised other peoples to watch my back
My life will never be the same
To tinsel town
Like I've Never, Ever Known
Did She Find Someone Else?
You Doggone Lover, Hee . . .

Still intrudes the night
Are You Ready
I see the door simply wide open
Face The Problems
Singing a song, citing a Bible verse
I’ll be so proud if you let me love ya girl
If you stay I'll find a way 
Can’t stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
She's going Hollywood tonight
Who are you
We never say, "I don't need you"
He really thought
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Then she looked at me
[3rd verse]
That's Much More In Demand
They'll Just Go On And On
Ain't No Stop And Go
It's A Passion In My Soul
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Girl, I know that this is love
You can cry on my shoulder 
To Just
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Reach out to a fantasy
To see your fantasies
Come to me, girl
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter
Keep on with the force don't stop (don't stop darlin')
Too Low To Get Under (Yeah, Yeah)

You've got a friend, yes you do 
Je ferme les yeux

You Can Shout Out All You Want To
Whatever happens, just don't let go of, my hand.
All you need is love,
A Lot Of People
No Matter How It Starts It Ends The Same

Think about life, I’d like to have my child
Stand Up! Stand Up!

You all have to answer to the one u above
This time around I'll never get bit
I Said But Unlock The Door,

Keep on with the force don't stop (keep on darlin')
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Cuando no estas
On how I feel
What about the holy land
"Ronny, you're so silly."
I Won't Give You Reason To Change Your Mind
On my own, I was lonely
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?
No matter how hard
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
Born To Amuse, To Inspire, To Delight
Scandal
The dearest things I know are what you are
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)
And soon childhood ends
Gonna Say Things To Ya
Tschada dada dada daa (Hold on, Hold on)
Need to feel your hand
Because You Know What's True
You just sit around just talking about it
(Always the lady in my life) All over all over all over

They know my every do's
And I don’t know what I’d do, if I can’t be with you
Don't take your love 
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my...
Then The World Will
Favourite Winter Coat

No more tears, no more pain
The sweet loving you've been giving me
You Got To Groove Just Like You Know You Should
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about
Tell me what's goin' down babe
It's Worth The Giving
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
I've Got To Make That Change,
And The Entire Human Race
for the Childhood
Dirty Diana!
Love you girl...
She wipes her tears away.
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
Every year, na na na
Or He May Never Let You Go
Her dreams are tumblin' 
(Fairytales, make-believe and you)
Thinking now that things won't be the same
But with your pen you torture men
[Verse 3:]
To see that the circus came today
Keep The Faith
(Just Good Friends)
Keep on with the force don't stop (until you get enough)
Yeah!)
As Long As We Believe In Love
Hold Me
There'll be so much dancing, singing
Oooh, don't take your love from me 
But there's no-one sitting there
The whole system sucks
There you are, I walk alone
Why you stab me in the back?
What do we get, she runs away
Now it's back to reality, for Ms. Hollywood
To Just 
Because you lost his love
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
As one for numbered numbers
broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I’m kidding
Pretty Young Thing
He wanna time bar
So let me keep you warm
Just not what you seek of me 
It Ain't Too Much Stuff
You are there somewhere
all the things you are, got to be mine
And tell me you like
When your spirit's on the ground 
Sometimes I part it up,
Say Girl I Need You
While I keep playin' the game
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
(now baby, oh)
Gonna Make A Difference
[CHORUS 3]
We're Gonna Have To Tell Him
We're Mean Is You
Confess! To steal the great achievements of the people, the accomplishments of the workers..."
Could never hope to top
Apology shallow like the ocean
Baby, yes I do, yes I do
As a sunny sunny day
Just Hold Me Baby And I'm
That makes it happen
So I can see your face 
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
This love will last though years may go
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Will I be the guy that you put down
Light up your face with gladness
And there's no peace inside (inside) (hold my hand, oh, yeah).
I start to give it up,
Keep doin' it
(Feel you with the sweetest love)
This Is Our Planet
We should have started long ago
I'd like to take sometime and get away, then they'll say,
'Cause your love is alright, alright
And shivers in fright
You know he really tried to take me
I can make you sunshine, make you happy
Waitin' For You
I like the way how you're touchin' me
I wish that love would come today!
Since you taught me by sharing your life
We've got rainbows yet to find 
Take A Look At Yourself, And
And will the sun ever shine
And how many children must we see
Especially 
Your country trusts you
(Starting With Me!)
I've Seen Her Look Better
And causes her mournful cry
You'll be a part of the world of make believe
I'll always come home
I Really Love It
And you're cold inside
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
Then, Won't You Taste It
Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)
Give In To The Fire
this the bomb, ring the alarm
And Girl No Matter What Was Said
that you can get to me with anything 
Before Your Mind Gets Blown
Sans toi c'est un enfer
It's got a lot of power,
Yeah Yeah! Yeah Yeah!
Even though I had to let you go
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
I never thought she'd leave me here forever
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
And I am so sad and lonely
And Susie ain't your friend
You're rapin' me off my pride
[Rap: Shaquille O'Neal]
You're takin' morphine
Let That Rhythm Get Into You
Damn self righteousness
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real 
I Pray This Punishment
To take my time wherever I go
Keep on with the force don't stop (keep on baby)
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
In Our Darkest Hour
(what you do to me)
Scared of the moon
Keep the brother on his knees
Stop pressurin' me
Her schemes and plans
We're innocently standing by
Everybody litigation
Don’t let go, I don’t wanna walk away
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
You've got a friend in me
Jam
Father's confused, mother despair
Our love goodbye
Her face bear such agony, such strain...
Wherever I go, whatever I do
You are a liar
On the move got fire in your shoes
I Need You
Not There
Telling me to love you
And soon you'll hear me 
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life
If I had only reach out
Tu amor aparece
I don’t want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Let this love lift you up
I am the moon light, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
Just one more step
'Cause I've been looking around
(Of without compromise, 
Then there's screaming in the dark 
And I Took Her For Granted I Was So Cavalier
No matter what, you just want to feel it again
It's just a part of it 
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
I'll give you my heart
Fight)
There's nothing wrong
I'd choose you babe, yeah
I Long To Get By
What About, What About...
In the middle of a village
Pretending That They're Not
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me
Do it for me, cause baby
Prepared that are a shame
Is that boy still alive? (uh)
Living the way that you choose
In This Place You'll Feel
The Girl Was Persuasive
Gonna Make It Right . . .
Je me sens si bien de t'aimer
As he came into the window
[Bridge:]
If I can follow through
We both knew it wouldn't work
'Cause I Know How 
Ain't it good to know
Or Whatever We Do To
'Cause I Just Can't Stop
And you are there, 
To Be Trippin' On Me
Eccentrialities 
Returning on beams of light
And after be your friend
Their mistaken jealousy (oh?)
Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout
Girlfriend
I've got to get stronger
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
Settling down ain't my nature
(I wrote ya) 
Beggin' I Ain't Lovin' You
And it's true
Knowing how much you loved me
I Can See The Signs
There's No More I Can Say
Don't Let Nobody Turn You 'Round Brother
You've been hit by
But it's just like my girl 
Cause They Got No Place
The years go by swiftly
Now it's coming through the walls 
That's how you make me feel 
Deep in your soul and let God decide
[Chorus 3x]
But Here I Go Falling Again
I Just Can't Hold On
You can ask my brother
I found my happiest days, 
All The World
I am sure of it
Pretending Not To See
I Wanna Rock (All Night) With You Girl (Sunlight)
Keep daring to motivate
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
(You rocked my world)
Aaow!
No One Can Hurt You Now
But with proof as sweet as you, noo
He wanna shake it up shake it down
Baby
oo you sexy
This girl lived in vain
No...
Must Come Together
But Everytime I Did It
This is like a fairytale with you
Because 
You should have told her (should have told her)
Every word that you say
And She Says . . .
Hey, what about yesterday
That's The Man
And Angels Sing
Si tu te vas
(hee hee hee)
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before
Yeah Keep The Faith
I Love The Way You Shake That Thing Girl
And it's floating through the room
Is out to kill
And yet we're not too young to know
I was alone in the dark when I met ya
I Pray In You I'll Find
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
I'm gonna be
You're aiming just for me
A monster that you can see disappear
Been Any Clearer
To the music got to love that filled my mind
Fine from the start
Ooh Johnny Raven
Say it's fair
Girl You Got To Hold Me
It's beautiful to watch love begin
I'm Johnny Raven 
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
Never knew we could be so strong
But it's just that I love you
I'll stand not well apart
It Seems That She Has Left Me
We care enough
You're doin' morphine
Web Of Sin
Shiny And Sparkly
Tell me things they all believe, I do
Speedin' On The Freeway
Nothin' Can Stop This Burnin'
I'll Be Okay
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
By fighting love tonight, baby?
Lift Up Your Head And Show The World You Got Pride
Where Did You Come From Lady
So let love (oh let love) take us through the hours
Uh, oh,...
They say that love's a word
Oh baby you keep a-running away 
Oh No . . .
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
I'm living lonely, baby
I Will Never Forget What We Had
From word of mouth you're breaking every law
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
In My Trials
Euphoria, Euphoria, Euphoria,Euphoria
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
There's A Place In
[Janet]
That Man, That Man . . .
And I Know That It Is Love
I ain't playing
(She's dirty)
That you said we were to gain...
(Doot-Do-Do-Do . . .)
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
Band
Who's the next for you to resurrect
You'd better look back it'll all be gone
Oooh, you are there, somewhere
A love that I cannot hide
My pocket were full and now my money's gone
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my
Sing it
A revelation

Then won't slap my face
Groove, Let The Madness In The Music Get To You
I changed up my flow
(Change . . .)
The break is on me then what do you got
I Don't Understand The Way You Think
Hee! Aaow!
He comes to give it again
A lifetime Love forever true
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! (uh)
We're Bringin' Brighter Days
If you just smile
After the staring, what did you say?
I Wouldn't Help It, No
Carry Me
Yesterday when I felt down I start
He wear no shoe shine
And though you fight to stay alive
Got to give some love
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
Don't Let Nobody Take You Down,Brother
It's all absurd
Fought in a battle, where nobody won
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Do it do it Let's do it do it
(Take A Look At Yourself, And
Cause everyday I watch you
But You Got To Keep The Faith
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
So Your Tongue Became A Razor
Gon' Keep It Brother
Each time my world seems like it's falling down 
Go on, baby
Seems I gotta need one girl
But as soon as love came
On the carousel
My Feet)
When I'm Not Around
I'm gonna write you back, ouuh, i promess you that
Oh oh morning glow
Shoo-hee
Beat me, bash me
(And the whole world has to answer right now
Maria don't you hear me calling Maria 
Thinkin' that they got it made
I pray to leave my body,
The world's a better place
I was disgusted by all the injustice
Euphoria, euphoria
Get up on the floor
So beat it, just beat it
It Just Seemed Like Heaven
She got your baby
You know what I'm talkin' about
In the light 
you can drive but you done
Your brother didn't make a nickel
And Splendidly Bright
Would lie for you
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do
I Have To Say To You
Love and understanding is what you need
I chase you every step of the way yeah yeah
No matter what, you just want to read it again
Morning glow all of your life
He say "I know you, you know me"
I Wanna Rock With You
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
But now it's very clear
Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man
[Laughing]
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
Alone?
He's just a bitch baby
I am tired of this devil
Are you infected with the same disease
Just Pull Over Boy
Exactly what you wanna see
Before too long,
Yes, She Said It, You Keep Dreaming
A soldier dies
How much I love you
Be my girl
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Don't Stop
You Got A Way Of Making Me
I'll find a way to sail my course
Predictions Fly Of Doom
I Swear I'm Keepin' You
I've Been A Victim Of A Selfish
Here I am baby come and take me
To a circus girl
The force is love power
She said that I don't care
And Get Your Ticket Right
We're sharing light brighter than the sun
The time might come around when you’d be moving on
[Chorus 2:]
P-I-T is B-A-D
Thanks to you I finally got a song, 
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Dah! Chika-Chika-Chika-Ah!
You’ve got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
[News Man]
Your night is free what you wanna be
I can make you feel alright
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
just to get in
you are not alone
Especially
If you want the one you love to touch
I was excited about the way that things could have been
Ma Ma Se, Ma Ma Sa,
You're just preaching the Bible and they still speakin you're a lier 
Dog gone
What would you do?
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah
Don't be bothered they said
I Wanna Rock - Rock The Night Away
Lovely is the feeling now
[1st Verse (Michael)]
(Party down)
You make the sun shine
Give It To Me
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
What I can't recall
Heaven must be wary 
Smiles coming through my tears
Because I Forgot The Key,
In the face
I think I might go insane
Your every lick baby
I Don't Believe It
Take me back, forgive me
This happiness to me
So tell me am I scary for you baby 
I'm a dancin' man yeah
So Why Did It End?
Do-Doot-Do, [Etc.]
Out On The Floor
Saying That She's Yours Not Mine
My heart's getting weak
If You Can't Hang With The Feeling
Late At Night When The Wind Is Free
Why did you let him get her?
Though you're far away
So Look The Truth
He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
And Don't Forget The Faith
Got A Mojo
You've been so kind 
Just Aren't Enough
(Just Good Friends . . .)
Just watch your mouth
Control of meHe really thought he really had
Je supporterai tout
So pray for all the lost children
Got To Give It
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
So don't be feeling this way boy!
'Cause There's A Chance For Chances
I remember you and I walking though the park at night
He wanna write my obituary
Deep in the night
Dom Sheldon is a cold man 
One sweet night I knew I would see
I Don't . . .
If we all cry at the same time tonight
Everybody gone bad
Holy Mary mercy me
If you could keep on,
And I Sure Would Like Just To Groove With You
Love is here
He want your vote just to remain TA.
And it seemed that everything was on my side
Your Hands
Can't You See . . .?
Scream in my face then pushed you back
Todo mi amor
To Buy You Things To Keep
That's right
Hear Her Voice
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
Fashioned so slenderly
And you need some love and care 
(All Night)
Time After Time I Gave You All Of My Money
Gonna hurt your mind
Today he's taking twice as much
It doesn't matter how you're holdin' me
That it's a thriller, thriller night
(That Doesn't Mean She
Keep on tryin'
And Just Enjoy Yourself 
But They Told Me
Dead and stuffy in the face
Hide every trace of sadness
Together we can make it, all the way
(Won't you give me some time)
If We Try
Like it was written in the stars I knew
And now all I have is memories.
You Say That Workin'
Why you wanna fix me? 
So Come Together
You'd do her for the money
[Pitbull:]
Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
Cause everyday at six
'Cause They Got Nowhere
Burnt despite our pleas
(Hoo!)
(there's a sign in the window)
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
[4th Verse]
She's Getting To You
When We First Met
And a miracle has happened tonight
Nothing here means anything
I'd be the world poorest millionaire
Float around
Reality brings forth realizm
So take off the mask 
(blood on the dance floor)
Tonight
I'm a dancin man yeah
Am I scary for you 
should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
Electric Eyes Are Ev'rywhere
for the Childhood I've never known...
Your butt is mine
Ooooooh yeah babe, yeah babe
You do it every time
Only God could decide
Catch a chicken with a P-Y-T
Why you wanna get me? 
Don't Try To Tell Me 
Hey hey hey 
Good Friends . . .
Show Him (Woo Hoo)
Because I’m keeping a place
Did She Find In Someone Else?
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
On A Cloudy Afternoon
Doggone Lover!
Or someone that you don't forget, no? 
(I'm So Tired Tired Now)
If I Can't Stop!
I know, I know, 
I Feel Some Heat Is On
Or was it my imagination?
So sad, regret it
on, come on, come on)
There'll Be Problems,
Though you tried to bring me to my knees
[Michael Jackson:] Thank you, Carlos!
You Know I Do
And No Message Could've
No grown-up thoughts
So Get On The Floor
But we still can change some things today... 
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
They use me for the money
If they had a friend like Ben 
She Looked Me Deep In The Eyes
Take life easy, so easy nice and easy
See what loving has done to me
('Cause There's A Time When
He wanna turn the key
I Really Want It
Beggin' Back Mama
I've Heard It All Before, Michael
To see you again 
To blame him if you will
You can close your eyes
(So hold)
You're Just Another Part Of Me . . 
Can I get how it feels baby
That's Why I Want You To
Don't give up our plans
Shameone, lay on me
I'm Starting With The Man In
Like A Rainbow
A life time, love so guarantee (guarantee)
You're dirty
(Ooo, ooo)
When things will hurt you
My Baby Cried
(Doh)
I Love You So
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh
So, Annie, are you OK,?
Don't you ever make no mistake 
And I can't believe that I can´t tell her no 
Ghosts be hiding everywhere 
Keep dirty
I'm in 
My father always told me,
Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me
We're talkin' danger, baby
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)
It Seems You Get Your Kicks From Hurting Me
And you know there's music to my ears
Look within your heart then ask,
You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did,
And Bloodshed On The Street
Your Thoughts Of Me Remain
(If You Can Keep A Secret)
You sit behind the mask
Now our separate ways we go
And I made it this time
Hey, don't regret girl, 
(Doot-Do-Do-Doo)
Throw Away My Time
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
Take A Look At Yourself And
All my fairytales are coming true
Let Happy be where Sadness was 
Till now
Don’t you don’t you like it
Is Fakin' 'Cause
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside 
Hee, We're gonna change the world,
I Just Want To Touch You
Root-Do-Do-Do . . .
But I can do anything, she's invincible
[VERSE 3]
You think there's nothing wrong
Won't be no romancing
I Like Lovin' This Way
That makes the world go round
There have been others
I'll look up and see
Oh, girl, you're so together
(My girl)
Who will live and who will die
Am I the beast 
And that's everywhere she goes 
Yet people push bullshit in my face
Then you left me all alone
(Say We're Just Good Friends)
That’s a chance I’ll take
(You are the lady in my life) Don't you go no where
Then, If You Want It
(Keep the brother on his knees)
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
(Ooh!)
You can find them when the letter’s bout to fall
Dirty Diana . . .
[Chorus x2]
Heaven can wait
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
the birds in the trees
Talkin', Squealin', Lyin'
You Got To Keep The Faith
So unrelying
Love Is The Answer
Je sais que c'est toi
And pins the child lying there
Just Good Friends . . .
Slaughtered in vain across the land
I don't know!
Take It Like You Want It
Forevermore
But knowing just why they're scared
You're my princess
Ma Ma Coo Sa
They wanna see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie
Sister confused, she went alone
All Is Going My Way
We'll never part,
And whosoever shall be found
Gonna Burn This Disco Out
Hold my hand (yeah)
So come on, baby come on
(Oh, no) 
(Love Me And Feed Me)
fortune or fame
You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy
You just call out my name 
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
You know you've always got a place where you can go 
Deep in my soul baby
Love Is Strong
And I'm a better man
Make you just wanna scream
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
But that's your hiding place
Every Head Turned 
Gonna Live Each Day And
We may not change the world in one day
Oh brother please have mercy 'Cause I just can't take it
Like The River Jordan
Like a rainbow after rain
If I'm Always Out Of Sight (Ooh)
I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (hold my hand)
(Close your eyes)
I am forever
We'd Stay On The Phone
I’m the floor when you fall, and when you scream it’s ‘cause of me
Don't Come Lovin' Me
And girl, I'll never get enough
You sue her for the money
And every night I'll say a prayer, 
Remember The Times
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Back In The Spring
They're All In Line
Cambiaremos al mundo manana
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
[Chorus x2:]
You're the one
You'll find that life is still worthwhile 
You Got It
Don't you go
They Follow Each Other On
Don’t know where we’re going
Wishing our families well
You tried everything, you never thought of before
That you’ll even sell your soul just to get a story sold
Sunny days seem far away
should have known she was a heartbreaker 
If you tell me to cry
And Hug Me)
Though your love is not for me
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable 
(Wooh) (Wooh)
You're One Of Us
Bring her good times 
And that's a fact yeah yeah
I am the one who said that you are free
Got rid of the rocks
(Speed Demon)
I'm right back where I wanna be
She Said You Know My Name
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - come on, you know
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
I hold the world sings
(Lead Me)
Nobody ever showed her about us (oh, ba-da)
Another day has gone
I'm in my (day, alright)
Girl, I need you sweet caress, oh
baby)
Melodie, you're my everything
Everyone they don't know me
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion 
If you're on that lonely night 
I'd choose you babe
Yeah Yeah!
What you're about
We've come to far
I'll Wait For You
The girl with the tune
When all the things you are, are mine
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
The whole world smiles with you
You'll do anything for money
I like the way how you're kissin' me
Maria 'cause honest girl you were the only one 
In Ecstasy
My father always told me
She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay,
She was struck down, it was her doom
Or let it be

They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair

Somebody's out
In your heart to forgive me
(If You Wanna Make The

Do we give a damn
Someone is following you
And It's Comin' After You
Let Happy be where Sadness was
All the blood we've shed before
Like we did, when we first met
What about the days
Creepin' from a dusty hole
And they eat your soul like a vegetable
I'll Take You There
Time And Shame
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
Though She Acts Like I'm
OK, I want everybody to clear the area right now!
Then you will bear it

Tu eres quien gana
Got Pitts by the door
She Knows I'm Watching

Tu voz me acaricia
Just because you know I love you so much

Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Because of you, uh uh

Somebody's Broken Heart
You'll probably never get this letter
"Oh my God, can't believe what I saw

You know you can't control me
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
As the blackmail story in all your glory
Just to tell you
Because Your Words Just Aren't Enough
Life's about a dream

I'm Gonna Show Your Boyfriend (Yeah)
You Can't Abuse It
Oh, what I mean is

Maria girl you know you were the only one 
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
(This paper) (Hee-Hee)
Tell me what will I do
All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
Oooh!

Of lust, gluttoney and greed?
I Feel Your Fever
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Will You Be There?
You're always in my heart
Us Holding Hands
Baby for you'se
It's Worth A Try
(She's doin' it, she's doin' it)
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here.
Her world is crumblin'
Why don't you scream and shout it
I'll fell breaking 
Power (ah power) is the force the vow
Make A Better Place...
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
Keeping your head up to the sky!

Nation To Nation
There's so many things we haven't tried
Oh your smile
For all the lost children
To know that woman
That makes the lonely winter seem long
Here's what you do baby 
It's black, it's white
Really Just A Waste Of Time
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
Blood is on the knife
I'm gonna give her all the lovin'
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
With a friend to call my own
Break of dawn, there’s no sun up in the sky
Peek in the shadow
I am your joy, your best of joy
Mama is still ahead
I Fell Trapped Into Her
And the sound of your voice
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High 
Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
But I want you to be happy
She Waits At Backstage
Do You, Do You, Do You, Do You
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
You Really Turn Me On
That's right, I want to be
Prentending you're giving them love
What are you gonna do?
You're my lady
3 And 4's In A Bundle
But she doesn't hear a word that he say
There we are as cold as ice
This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He bag production
All the children dead from war
Oh yeah
The Big Boy Stands
Don't You Know Now
You can never get me
I´m steady laughin', while surfacing 
She's going Hollywood
So take off the mask, so I can see your face
(Set me free)
[CHORUS]
You get sentimental, and
Keep your head up!
Or Is It Just A Lie
Yesterday
Because now it's onto me
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Don't let go of my hand
This time around yeah...
I let you fall into me
Ooooh... 
Hustlin', Stealin', Lyin'
Well, like a woman that's pregnant for ten months
I'll Pick You Up In My Car
Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalalalala
Woh
So I said lets get right on the floor
One blow to the head is all you need,
On a cloudy day
Believe In Yourself
Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed
The government don't wanna see
And nothing gonna stop
(are you OK Annie?)
I Try So Hard To Love You
Put all your trust in me
I am forever, I am forever.
Your body starts to shiver
In your mind you will find
There Are People Dying
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)
Pull Over Boy
I'd like to help you grow
She tried to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
She Knows When They Come To Town
Just like you
There's a ghoul upon the bed
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)
I’d like to have my child (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)
Push it in stick it out
Then Make The Change)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
And I'll be all you'll need
Fortune And Fame, A Life
You can never trash me
Billie Jean is not my lover
Uh...
And how many children have to die
She says
I need her sharing the world beside me 
Time's moving too fast for us
Sweet Seducing Sighs
God I Need You
Over me
[Chant:]
Faraway hot island
But There's A Bigger Problem
Don't Want To Lay Down In A Bed Full Of Lies
We are forever, we are forever
Now The Way That It Stands
I thought I heard you cry
Everything begins to set us free
She's giving hot tricks to men
What can I say to make you stay 
To feel letting my hair blow
He roller coaster
Can't Let Go
All alone she's in the ego zone
Be the latest
(I see you love me) 
When you look up in the air there’s a monster
You Got School Teachers
You Better Know Where
Yes remember I will always be around 
(Keep doin' it)
I've Been Here Times Before
(you've been struck by
I know you 
Or dime too
Look who took you under
Take And Deceive Me
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to
We've had our ups and we've had our downs
I Tried To Mastermind It
Wherever you may be
Get Up Won't You G'on Down
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
[Verse 1:]
L'été finira
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
(Proud)
Susie's got your number
They doin' what they used to hate
Would get embarrassed for every time
You'll remember a place
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
[Bridge]
Cause I love you
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
This dude won't last forever 
Leave Me Alone-Stop It!
C'mon And Groove (Yeah) Let The Madness In The Music Get To You
I Took My Baby To The Doctor
The word is out that you're doing wrong
Give me your wings so we can fly
We're living on sunset time
They told me you should sing a song
No Matter What It's Gon' Take
There Ain't Nobody There But Us
fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin’
Even sell my soul to the devil
You're so damn disrespectable
Her dress torn
Make you mine
I like the way how you're lovin' me,
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
'Lone, 'lone
Now I don't know where we are
Had a hold on me
Oh, ah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah
I Love You More Than He
You know
She hides from the color
I'm indestructible,
Come on babe, come on, oh yeah
I mess with good women
Then There Ain't No Room For You This Part Of Town
I really get it when you're
Oh, my, he's got his Demerol
Only know wherever I go
In The Night
Looking For Someone
My brothers my brother Na
Tell the angels no, I don’t wanna leave my baby alone
Unthinkable
She's working two jobs, keeping alive,
Yeah Stop Trippin'
Lust Can Blind
(Hoo! Hoo!)
He say that he needed that
All they say, I do
Of all faith looking new
Don't give up
When You're Always Up To No Good
Leaving Susie alone
But after it all
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life
Everything we said and all we done now
Is it me?
Painting the 
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
On My Knees
It's the man of steel organizm, twizm
That love is the answer to all that I am
Called that moon talk
I waited patiently
I speak a third language
You Are My Friend
Quench My Desire
You And For Me
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Hee-hee-hee
To Me I'm Bothered
All Night Long
I . . .I . . ., Aaow!
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
Without You
I feel I’m your blue
Start Living
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Everybody say that time is borrowed,
What will she do to see the world?
Turn it up
Your business, is my business
Thriller here tonight
Here comes the rain
Turn to you when they need more honey
Speculate to break the one you hate
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
[Chorus:]
I'll be there to help, 
It's Gonna Feel Real Good!
Stranger in Moscow
I Gave Her Passion
I Don't Need No Dreams When I'm By Your Side
I'm tired of being abused 
If You Keep The Faith
And He Says So Endlessly
Kisses for your loving
You are disgustin' me
Only the strong survive
Ain't double same
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
Let me be, be the one to straighten it out, girl
Junto a ti por siempre
They've gotta hear it from us
Wish the rain would just let me
Things come and they come and then they go
Gonna change the world, Ooo
When this old world gets you down 
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
We're almost there darlin'
That She'd Love Me For All Time
So why make our lives harder (hold my hand)
She never cut from me
Within my heart, oh yeah
I know, I know, I know, I know, 
And We're Gonna Ride The Boogie
I'm So Proud To Say
(Annie, are you OK?)
For Awhile
Change the world
I could love you better than I used to
That Aren't So Sure
Just Keep Your Eyes On The Prize
And Now I Wonder Why
I Know That You Can Sail Across The Water
Right down to my bones 
Heaven Is The Prize
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
That's So Carefree
Don't Hide Our Love
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
Lovin' You Will Be So Right
Then you will dare it
All The Things We Said Like
'Cause this is love power (ooh)
And You Will See
After Dark..., Do You, Do You, Do You
Climb The Highest Mountain
Hoo-hoo!
And all the prolems that I caused you
Just beat it, beat it [4x]
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)
In the black
I'd never leave for a minute
dah dah dah dah dah people 
Who sings in the daytime at noon
You're throwing rocks at me
Someone in the dark for me
The Self
(Rock me with your sweet caress) Lay back with me
All my dreams been broken
Has become my daily need
Paul, I Think I Told You, I'm A Lover Not A Fighter
What about killing fields
Uuuuuuuuuuh Ahhhhhhhh.
So every night I say a prayer, 
There's A Magic That Must Be Love
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
I started talking
Let gets up and never stops, no
It's tough for you to get by
No, if the angels took me from this earth
(Loving We Will Share)
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found 
I've Spent A Lifetime 
Hard to convince her
Someone like you to call mine
Don't Try To Understand Me
From a far corner, out of the dark
To turn around
Please tell my why
Will You Show To Me
Somebody's out to use me
Heaven's Glad You Came . . .
Every Night She Walks Right In My Dreams
If I started now in the deep
A monster, the worst thing to fear.
But there she lies shivering
Don't Try To Fight It
its home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
Standing there with the top of the round
Something about you
He hot willed in the face
Passion's Insanity
So Won't You Just Let Me Be
Right now
Now We're Just A Web Of Mystery
To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And Ooh Won't You Take Me There
Love you so much it's not funny
Dance The Night Away
Rockin' robin' 
[Paul]
Girl, you know it seems
And then she wrote: 
Mingle Mingle Jingle
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
Tell the things you are to me and
Got to reach that driver
Were Laughing At Me In Town
If You Only Let Your Feelings Through
He's got monkey finger
Keep movin' on higher ground
(Uuh)
You're Stuck In The Middle (Yeah, Yeah)
And No Message Could Have
False Prophets Cry Of Doom
I used to say "I" and "me"
You Got Me Workin' Workin' Day And Night
Won't You Rock Across The Room
So We Can Rock Forever, On
I don't think so
Come On!...
[8th Verse]
When and how I get down 
I'm sure they'd think again
I'm Tired Of Thinkin'
This Will Be A Love Lasting For All Time
Keep on with the force don't stop (don't stop baby)
(Yeah-Make That Change)
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around
I know your game
It’s got you drunk enough to fall
And Scream Out To The World
Living for one another
But nobody to be found
Is my mind I can hear
But all the while you hear the creature creepin'up behind
You’re fearing me, ‘cause you know I’m a beast
So listen to my heart
All of those faces
All the injustice"
(Oh Yeah!)
I Guess The Lady
I've been around the world getting off the chain
Inside One Heart Could Find
And It Doesn't Seem Right
[Chorus (2)]
You feel love so deep
Come On!
So You Believe In You
Where will she go?
I need you around
High Heels On
I'm so excited how you
(Anywhere) 
We'll be present at the birth
(I don't wanna talk about it)
For You And For Me
And Don't You Pretend We Didn't
How is it that you get to choose
Too bad too bad about it
Give It To Me-Give Me
You suddenly appeared
(I Love You Too-I Want You
Can it be I stayed away too long
Ain't Nobody's Business,
You and me not alone
When you see them in the street
For Such Reasons Unexplained
Then I will fake it
Blow rockin' robin 
I see the evil is you
Sans toi j'ai froid
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
You better not shout where you gonna go
We Can Make It Right
Yourself!
I Played The Fool For You
Slander
Mind!
It's gonna come around
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
Getting higher
I was wondering, you know
Ah ah
I Love You Baby
Jew me, sue me
there vision, the missin’ the pack, this is that,
And I'm really mad
But if Martin Luther was livin'
A word we've only heard
That you said was yours and mine...
You'll Be Always Tryin'
He wanna do something keen to you
Night creatures call
Told me that you're doin' wrong
Even the little honey bees
In Each Other's Eyes
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
That girl I can't take her 
Porque me has dado
If you show me the cash
Lift Your Head Up High
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
Touch me and I feel on fire
Am I scary for ya baby 
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (yeah)
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Doin' It On The Highway
Love all the things
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it - you know it
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky 
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
I've been dreaming of meeting the picture
My girl
Smile, though your heart is aching
Just call my name, and I'll be there
And Innocent Then
Hazme el favor y prestame el mojo
Or Do To Each Other
Go underground young men...
The task may seem
Ooh!
But this time around I'm taking no s...
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
(You Gotta Get It Right, While
(Ooooh . . .)
So I won't slack
You're saluting the flag
I'm telling you
But Till That Day I Said You've Got To Keep The Faith!
I will stay in your heart
When you're alone
You put a knife in my back
Then Don't Have A Baby (Yeah, Yeah)
Let’s not wait, the sun is out, let’s get up and let’s get out
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can (if you just, if you just).
Tell me what has become of my life
Ooh, The World
To close Susie's eyes...
Where have I been? 
I tell you I know it's coming soon
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear
[RAP]
Doing that moonwalk
Love it or hate it, it's Mr. Worldwide
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,
Just walked away
Love is as welcome
Chika-Chika
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
That you've got a friend 
Each time I see a rainbow
If You Live It Off The Wall
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
I can't quit now
And hold you in my arms
Ah we're almost there
You're doggin' me [repeat 7x]
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
This Wind Is Blowin' My Mind
Either you're wrong or you're right
Feel the vibe cause I can feel in mine
Just show your face
Morning glow all days long
While people still cry for equality
She told me she forgiving me
You can cry on my shoulder
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
And show her that she's my girl 
I'll Be Crying Everyday
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol
There's Something I Would
You really got a hold on me, come on
Empty words are not enough
A Major Love
It's black, it's white, woo
she only knows how low that she can go 
And the whole world has to
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through
Tell Me
You ever want something 
(She's holy Mary moly Mary)
Just you ask, I'll come back
In the raw they don't know what you saw
(I give you my heart)
Love, Love, Love,Love
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go 
Black Jeans And
Worth Living
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)
Why you wanna hit me? 
Look at my face
When you speak the angels all sing
With Tears In Her Eyes
[AD LIBS]
Mine And My Baby
funeral’s, cemetaries, don’t worry it’s time to visit
Let me touch you with my love
Maria don't you miss me just a little 
As I turned on the TV this evening
I cannot explain the things I feel for you
(You Knock Me Off Of
You've got a place to go
Here come ol' flat top
Susie got your number
(uuh)
Kill for it
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Yeah I'm Johnny Raven
You know, you know, you know it - shameone
Who do you love, babe? 
I want to be
Let Sadness see what Happy does
You gotta touch the one who loves you) 
Remember this
It's slander
You Gotta Know When It's Good To Go
The Final Message
It Is Friend Of Mine
They try to tell us we're too young
Wanting No Break Time
That you are not alone
Can't afford to waste it 
What do you get, things she would say
Where restless soul's spoke 
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
Then You Must Be Seein'
When you cry part of me's gonna die
I said a prayer so silently
Means Never Givin' Up On Love
This time around
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
(You are the lady in my life) doo doo doo
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I'm in my
(And together we can make it all the way) 
[INTRO]
(We've got forever, forever)
[Interlude]
But if it gets too rough
You know I'm smooth - I'm Bad - you know it
Just Simply Do The 
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate
You're not in my arms
Truth be told the grassy knoll
You know I'm bad - you know
Erase the past
Hell all up in Hollywood
And nobody's there...
Relax Your Mind
So don't you ever complain
As She Stalked The Room 
I am forever, I am forever
I know his mother never taught himright anyway
She's headed for the big time, that means
In This Bliss
Causing grief in human relations
It Is A Friend Of Mine
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Gotta Straighten Up Your Act And Boogie Down
And you give, in your love
We've Got So Much Corruption
"Dear Michael, every time your record's on
Les femmes d'avant toi
(Baby, baby, baby)
What lifetime was I in? 
and you control your world
[1st verse]
Make me wanna scream
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
Say
Those Special Times
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
That’s all I’ve known
(Won't you write me back?, please write me back) 
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
I Want To Go Too Far
My Life Ain't Worth Living
Start to fall
We're ravaging the seas
Like Ben
Keep on reachin, do it for me
Gonna Feel Real Good Now!
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
I know, know, know, know, know, 
It Ain't
I'll write a hundred more" 
But things don't always turn out
If I Can't Give Sweet Love To You
If You Cant Feed Your Baby (Yeah, Yeah)
I thank the Heavens above that I met ya
Ben, most people would turn you away
Who Said The Future's In
Someone's Always Tryin' To Start My Baby Cryin'
Stand Up And Lift
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
I am here to stay
Sayin' You Just Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
But You're No Damn Lover 
She Said I Have To Go Home
You Know That Love Survives
I like the way how you're holdin' me,
Is He Hot On My Tracks
Don’t walk away
Don't let it get you down, 
Ooooooh 
You know I'm bad - I'm bad - you know it, you know
The fantasy you see is like a child again through rainbow colored eyes
Hit The Lovin' Spot
You Knock Me Off Of My Feet
yeah, yeah by abd by
If You Call Out Loud
Each Time The Wind Blows
"I Love You, Liberian Girl"
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Did God say that they could decide
What about animals
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight
I give you my heart

(why are you haunting me)
He’s keeping you down like a monster
Free and untamed that's how I've grown
Will I Do 
What about nature's worth
He wanna lay you down

Yeah, yeah
There Was A Time I Used To
Ya smilin at me while, ya stealin right before my eyes 
Hold me, hold me
When You Have To Say
Talk To Me Woman
Yourself, Now!
Making it wet
[Repeat/Fade-Out]
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Keep your head up, don't give up, today!
Not not being alone
Tonight is your night but this is what you loose
And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
She Looked Right Through You
That's Because They Don't
[Instrumental]
I like the way you're lovin me'
Wound This Earth
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me
With rain and with sunshine
Who Knows The Situation
Don't want to spend another day here
Better Stand Up And Act Like You Wanna Do Right
I wanna, wanna be where you are
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
I'm gonna write you back
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves
You'll get by...
Keep on with the force don't stop (don't baby)
[1st Verse]
You think you’re by yourself, but it’s my touch you felt
The foulest stench is in the air
There'll be no darkness tonight
With your fear and sorrow
Hoo-hoo

Look at my heart, burning is all heartbreak
There Ain't Nothin' That You Can Do
Got to give some loving
I lost my heart
Show You All The Magic That A Perfect Love Can

Your will to self motivate
She's doin' morphine

Eat Your Ticket
You are there to help me see it trough, 
Of What It's About
Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I Do
To face whatever falls my way
I need you by my side
I'll be a man the way
Of happy with your feelin’ blue

Ain't no love in this world
To erase the past 
The storm clouds stay away, yeah
If you give it with guilt
(it was your doom)
Then With Guy
Though we're miles apart
I know ya name and the game is I own you 
Just a little bit baby
God is jammin' on the run
Lift Up Your Mind
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
Stop *?!@#!in' with me
Knowing how I feel 
Then I want it too
But right now I just feel cold, so cold 
And Show The World You Got Pride
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Then we'll add up the pleasures
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
No force of nature can break
Get Your Ticket
Cuts through the air
We're bad for life
This Is The Mission
Heartbreak enemy despise
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable 
I Don't Need It
Ooh!! 
If you do I'll understand, 
Hey!
When you're feeling all alone 
A-Acha-Acha
Even burst the breast
Helpless Like A Baby
Dangerous
Ain't Nobody's Business-
What about all their joy
(It's The Choice That We
And with all that I've been through, 
Is that scary for you baby 
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)
(Close the door)
I Can't Live My Life
So They Called Her Mouth A Motor
When I get close to you
You Hurt My Baby
And don't like what you find
Keep your head together 
'Cause a madman's out tonight
I don’t know what I’m gonna do I can’t stop lovin’ you
My Lonely Days Are Gone-
Should I get down on my knees and pray
I told my mama how I feel about your power
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...
Don't you, don't you let go
A knock-out queen
God is jammin' all around
No
But if you wanna be, yeah
You Always Knew Just How To Make Me Cry
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Changing people's heads around
A Two-Edged Sword
Tell Him What You Do To Me
Je ne veux plus tricher
It was all for God's sake
Then She Sings A
I want you to remember
Beat me, hate me
Assassinate and mutilate
Everywhere you are
Am I scary for you oh 
That is what they're tellin' me
Do You    Remember The Time
I'm heading for the border
Don't you break my heart
I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely
But That Don't Mean That I Don't Know Where We Are
Can't understand anyone having the blues
J'aimerais t'appeler
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
and when you bury me underneath all your pain 
Knowing The Girl
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart
The Love You Bring
Me conoces bien
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
So don't send no doctor to my door
Spark My Nature
She's So Fine
Close your eyes and count to ten
Come on shine far all you're worth
And if you wanna to see 
If you ask me to lie
Gonna take you higher
(She's goin' down)
Algo sagrado
Heroine and Marilyn
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
When You're All Alone
Oooh
(Woah, woah, woah, woah, baby)
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
KGB was doggin' me
The crying Earth the weeping shores
Nobody should be grievin' this way
At Your Call
If I had a penny for everytime
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
Every soldier dies in his glory
As you live, you learn though a torch will burn
After you made me all your own
Somebody's out to get me
Don't Waste Your Time
We are forever
Did you have to go
Here abandoned in my fame
I never hit you when you're down
Ooh
If you are the one for me
Be God's Glow
Then stand here in my shoes
I'm Asking Him To Change His
A hot kiss honey
Somebody please have mercy
[2nd verse]
Maria don't you need me just a little 
I hate your kind baby
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
"All the injustice"
So undesirable
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Just put ya dime on the line baby, cos i own you, 
You know, I was,
It blows my mind to know
And The Pain Is Thunder (Yeah, Yeah)
This ain't no good for me babe
A Feeling So True
Is The Perfect Time
'Til that day you're really mine 
He's had his fall
Am I scary for you baby 
You are not alone
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
And when things fall apart
Just won't do, ooh baby
[CHORUS 2x]
(I'll give you my heart)
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
He got flat baby
I Know She's Mine
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
Come on back
Show Him How You Feel Inside
(You Knock Me Off My Feet)
No hay quien me de
Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...
So Give Yourself A Chance
Who's Doin' Me By
I bet he never had a social life anyway
[Verse 2:]
Don’t know the worst, she knows a atheist
That burns in my heart
Mask of life, feelin' insane
You can look at them climbing out the bushes
Some Things Take
When We Fell In Love
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
My love is strong now
Like A Pleasure Trip
No need to worry no need to fear
Feeling glorious, full of love
You just sit around just talkin' nothin'
So do surrender
I'm Stoppin' At Nothin'
His place in world history
[ROD SERLING INTRO]
(Lay back in my tenderness) Lay back with me

All my mama ever did
Please don't close the door to our future
Life Like You're The Law
Not alone, Not alone

You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl
Mine And My Baby's
Annie, are you OK?
You Are All The Future That I Desire
Gone Too Soon
Show You All The Passion Burning In My Heart
All you have to do is call 
Give me your wings so we can fly!
Leave Me Alone

Yes, I Believe In Me
Y diremos adios a la tristeza
[P.Y.T.'S] Na Na Na Na

Tell Me What Will I Do?
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
You try to get me to lose the man I really am

It happened fast
You're Everything This World Could Be

In your life 
And it make me feel like ah,
Just a little o' your love, every day
Love ain't what it used to be
Hey hey Maria 
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
If he dies sympathize

To fly away just like a sparrow
I Promise You Now That The Dawn Will Be Different

Was try to take care of her kids
Baby don't leave me 
Don't let no one get you down
Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines
Avoiding ships of fools
His eyes looked like mine
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
She put you under
But The Power's In Believing
Fever, temperature's risin' now
And Care Enough To Bear Me
Me-No
It's really too soon
A Fool Who Lives Alone
Cinderella, I just know
All I know is

Can't you see that I'm in love 
It's you whose haunting me 
I got song you enchanted me
But remember sister or brother

Now If They Ask You
[Rebbie (spoken)]
With this smile upon my face
This life don't last forever (hold my hand)

Police after being wrongly identified as a

Go On Girl!
Grandfather's soul too had flown...

So tell me what we're waiting for? (hold my hand)
And that my daddy had no gun
What about all I've seen?
Oh, for God's sake
What do you say?

On fera l'amour
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 
He's got walrus gum-boot
She Gives It To Me
The foolish trickery 
So what does it mean
Then Maybe Somehow We Can Work It Out
'Cause Doctor John been here before
She disappeared into the crowd
Girl, Close Your Eyes
When Lost Will You Find Me?
Ooh, oui, oui

You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)
I Won't Stop Until
Hey hey hey
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
I need my privacy, I need my privacy
I Am The Damned
When you live, in your love

Through My Joy And My Sorrow
But only the man from next door
You Came And You Changed
You'll return, but until you do, baby
I'll plant you a garden
Don't delay this
How about New York City
And the prayer that frees the soul
You're throwing shame daddy
Where did we go wrong
Make Your Move
You Got To Not Let Yourself . . .
Is there in your eyes
All I can (yeah, yeah, hold my hand)
She Always Takes It With A Heart Of Stone
She waits her life away,

Susie says its right
Cause what we're searchin' for
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
I Don't Like A Lady

I Gave Her Everything
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)

But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
'Cause we're almost all almost there

Dust Off Your Butt
Gotta Get The Leadway
Don't turn around
There is nothing in your eyes

When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool
Take me back
She cries inside everytime she feels this way
She'd be sitting here beside me
Come On Be My Girl-I Wanna
Her direction has a dimelight
If you could only
Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die
Make me fly away...
So they fake it
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Ain't double same, loving me bring me game
And Thoughts
Your Talk, Your Dress

Little children laughing
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever
How can I begin again
If you just reach out for me girl
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It isn’t. It’s the beginning.
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
From Their Suspicions
Now I believe in miracles
Like a mirror reveals the truth 
'Cause you might see me cry
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know
Twisting her soul
One blow to the head is all you need
The dreams that we're dreaming
You Cannot Wet It
I just feel so good, so good 
Just wait 'til I get through...

We Must Live Each Day
You'll seeeee.
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you
You'll Only Be A Girlfriend Of Mine 
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Can the heart reveal the proof 
Will soon be found
Since The First Time She Came
the bees envy me
Said lord have mercy
So Tell Me
Here Comes The Man
And One Day You'll Discover
All alone wishing on stars
But after the snow
Love today...
Will It Get Inside
How does it feel
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
Everybody's gone mad
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
Love was taken from a young life
Go For What You Want
Still They Hate You, You're A Vegetable
And Then It Happened
You Really Can't Make Him Hate Her
Hold my hand (yeah, yeah)
And she was well aware
Get the boy and make him wait
And Walk When Not Able
She's Got The Breaks
To know this stranger
She asked the men in blue
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
Than the love I can give
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
Como yo
Hoo!
The wise old owl, the big black crow 
You see
See, if the police don't take it 
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there

He wanna jump back half flap doing it right
You're Just A Product Of
There's No Hurt Or Sorrow
So listen up
You know it's thriller, thriller night
I held the tears back long as I can
Every time your lady speaks she speaks of me, threatened
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
Your sitting in your room
What about rain
All along I knew you were a phony girl
And when all calls
You make me shine
Go on, baby!
But I Loved It
If you smile
Set me free
Cause we're almost there darlin'
Blood is on the knife 
Is Still Making Up Her Mind
We've already had enough
Somethin' About You Baby
Ooh, girl, you're so together
I Felt Taken By Lust's
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
When you return to your hometown
So I've Learned That Love's Not Possession
C'mon, Girl, C'mon Girl
He wanna give hot jump shot
Happy, that's you

You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
What have we done to the world
You Know It!
Give It When I Want It
Won't You Come, It's Emergency
Got A Hot Foot
Got to make you mine
Every Morning Birds Would Sing
All Night... All Night

In My Anguish And My Pain
So she ran into the bedroom
Don't stop 'til you get enough

'Cause
I Can't Help But Love You
Is It My Brother?
How does it feel (How does it feel)
I Know The Girl

Just climb on the wings of my love 
Skin head, dead head
[ROD SERLING OUTRO]
Jam Jam
Take me back where I belong
We were together most of the time
Hey Baby Do What You Want

Blood is on the dance floor
Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
You won't live a quiet life,
and you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable 
The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine
(why did you do it, why did you, why are you stalking me)
It's very easy to say
Like fantastical stories to share
Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,
I wrote a letter, for the getto of the CIA, 
Inside Of Me
Then Make That . . .
They wanna get my ass
Built Upon A Sandy Beach
If you show me the man
When there are clouds in the sky
Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson
I Love You, Liberian Girl,
All along I had to talk about it
Somebody's up, somebody's down
In the glow of candlelight
All nations sing
Better Do It Now Before You Get To Old
Movin' Up A Hand
She's Got The Look ...
I'll Be The Freak You Can Taunt
I Said I Have No Time
(Look at the lovers) 
Too Much
A Matter Of Time
In my search to find myself
You better listen to me, yeah
I am tired of this stuff
[Repeat Chorus - Ad-Lib/Fade-Out]
That's all I need, that's all I need
Talk To Me Baby
Or see it on the TV screen
How great to give love without invitation
When she says, "Hello world!" 
Maybe you didn't know that baby
You'll Find There's No Need
(Always the lady in my life) All over [x7] baby
MJ for life
She put seven inches in
To Give It To You
Never letting fate control my soul
Speed Demon, You're The
For a love we used to share
(will you tell us that you're OK)
And you don't have to read it, read it
Because It's Just A Matter Of Time
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
I Hear Your Voice Saying
There's a creak behind the door
Ah, On The Floor And Dance
Your burdens I will bear
Who will live and who will die?
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
You Can Call Me Honey 
I Have To Find My Peace Cuz
I might tell on you
Everybody wants to read all about it
I can make you feel so right
I Feel We Belong
What about crying whales
Living is all I see
Let tomorrow be your friend
Ouuh, you are there, 
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
Baby I’ll stay, Heaven can wait
No no no no, no no no no
With No Food To Eat
Cannot Lie
Couldn’t take nobody loving you the way we were
[Michael & Paul]
I Wanna Rock With You (Yeah) (All Night)
They Don't Understand
Of popcorn and candy
Dirty Diana
Although I know we've drifted far
And It's Okay
(You're just studying my mind)
Gotta Get A Leadway
And spirits dancing 
Todo mi amor eres tu
Just give yourself a chance,
Of disappointments and confusions
A love that's true because of you
She's Saying That's Ok
It's Gonna Feel Real Good,
She's Got
we hold each other 'til we see the sunlight.
What about God?
Set You Free
So don't you start no stuff with me

Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh I, Oh)

World A Better Place)

Don't Let Nobody Turn You 'Round
Feels like a fire
[Chorus x 2]
This time around I'm taking no s...
Roots I'll never own
Ooooooh [x10]
I like the way how you're lovin' me
What Are We Doin'
Lost as a little lam was I, till you came in
You feel I’m real
I Love The Way You Shake That Thing (Girl)
Don't let it get you down
Rock With You, Rock With You Girl (Yeah)
Come on, come on,
It's Out Of My Hands
You Got Homeless People
That's why I've got to be there 
If you can, if you can find it
I took my baby on a river boat cruise
Living hot, doing what you should not
And then falsely accuse me
Ooh just a, just a, 
I've got to be there so she knows 
That glows in my heart
You're the one that I adore
Biding a life, reading the words
Pour te dire amour, toujours, je veux te garder
For we sing tomorrow's song
Masquerade the heart 
(She's)
That's the time you must keep on trying
And We Can Ride The Boogie
Let's do it do it Dance what you wanta
But no one can find thee
Akon and MJ (oh, yeah)
It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
The more you want it

Happy Tears
An invitation to some
She Likes The Boys In The

When there’s nothing left to do but walk away
You really got a hold on me
I Don't Know Whether To Live Or Die
Tell It To The Preacher
Look at you little girl
Down by surpriseI bet he missioned with the CIA
What about apathy
If you just smile...
And as the years go by we'll stay as true, 
You know, you know, you know it - come on
From Wrong
In one blink I’ll disappear, and then I’ll come back to haunt you
I was afraid of life and you came in time
Sensual Disguise
I won't be complanin' (ooh ooh)
Gonna stay
Now you can't stop me even thought you think 
If it's taking a chance
Today!
Then to scream out
But it’s been so long now all I do is cry
Smile, even though it's breaking
You Know What I Mean
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it) 
Happy, oehoe happy
To Sorrow

When I come to you

She ran underneath the table
Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
Do You. Do You, Do You,
Now yesterday is gone
To Each Other
Making a toast to the king
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
He one holy roller
She Said Later
To make my mother smile
(Too bad)
Another nest to try
I bumped into you by the corner store
Is He Getting Nearer
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Just To Check Yourself Out
I'll Never Let You Part
You know it - you know it - you know
Back In The Fall
Keep on with the force don't stop (yeah)
Na Nah)
And I did
You'll Only Be A Girlfriend Of Mine
My business, is your business
Baby baby, don't give up
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Full euphoria
Hee!
('Round and 'round and around...)
And Get Your Self-Respect Back
So don't be feelin' no pain!
You Got Me Workin' Day And Night (I Don't Understand It)
A smooth criminal)
I've got to be on time
I Love The Way You Shake Your Thing
She Said I'm All Yours
Yes . . .Just Good Friends
By The Time This Hit The Street
Anytime she goes away 
My Brothers
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it
I tried to keep my sanity
My world
Ever do what you do for me
Brighter Than Tomorrow
Uh, uh, uh, no
Is it me? 
So let love take us through the hours
It doesn't have to be that bad
When you're down and trubled 
...Gon' Keep It Brother
She Says There's No Turnin' Back
How can you cage a bird
Gone One Night
I can't straighten it out, girl, yeah
Soon Enough Darlin'
The Way She Came Into The Place
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go
Keep on with the force don't stop
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
All The People
No hay quien me de lo que das tu
Release two or three, when  I reach I can go ‘til I hit my peak
I am the cover of the magazine, what a scene
Better Freak Across The Floor
Gonna change the world, Sing it
I was the only one around (the only one around)
Then Tonight Ease The Lovin' Pain
Stab me in the back
Ne comptent même pas
(I Guess It's Still You Thrill Me, Baby, Be Mine)
Soy joven, lo se
(Wooh)
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
You are the king of the hill
Ain't nothin' like a love desire (ooh)
But I say it's just
Things I Say
You Cannot Cleave It
You think he brother with the KKK?
Before your eyes 
Cheater... 
She's Got Just What It Takes
Though She Never Shows
Just a little time is all it takes
Y pregunto por ti
So they came into the outway
And She Promised Me Forever
And take your soul if you let them 
Say it again
You make me sick baby
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson
And she was the dancer
(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl),
SpeechlessYour love is magical, that's how I feel 
As the headline stories of
Don't let it, let it, let it... 
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
baby I've got what it takes 
She's Out Of My Hands
There Is No Danger
Loving me bring me game
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Go On Girl!-Hee Hee!
She was there screaming
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Will Shine Again In Grace
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me
What about flowering fields
You'll seeeee...
Be With Mine
Ya, tellin' me that ya comin to a compramise 
Take my name and just let me be
Ne t'en vas pas
Starts to glimmer when you know
I'll never be alone
Look at my words, what do they say?
So Keep The Faith, Ow
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
We are forever, … keep on, we are forever, … keep on, have to be strong
Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
It's on my mind
Gonna Make That Change . . .
Yesterday is when I felt down
Don't make a fight,
We'd Be Together
You are the promised kiss of springtime
Farewell, my summer love, farewell
Oh, oh
You Have To Rub It
'Cause I'm Bothered Everyday
Like a child who's got no home 
And she answered "No" to me but
Just to tell you once again...
She Told Me That I'm Her Forever Lover, You Know, Don't You Remember
Come On
Music and me
Is like the month of may, yeah
Diana!
Get Yourself Together
He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl
And I Don't Know Whether To Laugh Or Cry
And I Will Then Say To Thee
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Everybody dog food
Don't shoot to kill
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And You Know Damn Well
Then Make That . . .)
Hey.
Stay awhile
that if you block me, you've done your thing 
You soul survivor
And I'll, I'll Not Find
Would make life beautiful
You And Your Manipulation
I’m the one watching you
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
For you only
(I'll take my time, baby)
In The Temple
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
Morning rider
Gonna change the world, Hee
All the lies you have to say I do
You Can Call Me Honey
What you are for me I'll be for you
Here I am so all alone
Shorty really wanna be there for me
She lie there so tenderly
You Didn't See-Her Eyes On
Baby, do it for me, do it do it baby
I'm on that
Will Always Be Dear To Me
So I could blow'em open
But I want her to be mine
Feeling Passion And Lust
In the suite, on the news
Make
you did
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)
But I can't make you stay
I like the way how you're touchin' me,
What about Abraham
(Lift Me Up Slowly)
Je vais t'emmener
What about heart?
We've turned kingdoms to dust
Dying With The Rising Of The Moon
I Like The Groove Of
Don't give up our dreams
Just to try and see you smile one more time
in her painted on jeans
What about forest trails
Theirs a goul beneath the bed 
It was cloudy before but now it's clear
When things would hurt you
You sit around and I watch your face
Turn us around
Ma Ma Sa, Ma Ma Coo Sa
You should have told her
So just let it be
Or Paris, France
Tales of what somebody told
It's Never Gonna Fade
(Why do you keep stalking me)
He’s dragging you down like a monster
Not Dangerous
(Carry)
(All is grand, all is bright)
'Cause You're The One For
I Want To Love You (P.Y.T.)
Who ran away
He’s a monster
Le terre pous trembler
[Michael Jackson:]
they don't really care about
What about life?
I believe you and I
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
I love in season
I've Got The Feelin'
Don't you go no where
That We See
Make)
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
In My Deepest Despair
Going know her way
His father grabs his hand
Then You Must Be Seein' (Woo)
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
And Never Did I Ask You Questions Why
Don't get me
What you're willing do
The girl won't break it
The fear of a child
Born to be wild
Smooth Criminal
Harmonica in my hand I got soulful rhythm in me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
A stranger who'd be my friend
You turned and you walked
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Master of the rhythm beat ohh
and I know you hate it, and you can't take it 
[fade out]
I Often Wonder If Lovin' You
Then watch the ones
Give me a notion 'cause
Who do you love?
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
While the world goes spinnin' by
Do We Know Right
I Asked My Neighbor
We shall have each other
You pay the price of fame
Happy days will drown the pain
I Can Say, Hey . . .Farewell
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
Conceived In
Wishing them well, and wishing them home
You made me love you
Love's Enough For
And A One Man's Soul
With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream
En mi corazon
Is is scary for ya baby 
her only goal is just to take control 
To fly away just like a sparrow (Oh, my, my)
I'm gonna take you higher
And when I come to you 
We're gonna change the world
Get Me Out
And together we'll fly
Love Me Forevermore
(We are here to change the world)
(he’s like an animal)
(will you tell us, that you're OK)
To make it up to you 
He's got early warning
I've Got To Be On Time
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
You are the angel glow that lights a star
My brother keep striving your child relies
And wishing them home
With the words you use
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Then Why Don't You Just
I like the way you shake it [x2]
The world is the biggest school
Rock You Into Day (Sunlight)
I Know I Am Someone
Read the Holy word
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
So Keep The Faith
And this person or thing is soon to be met
We're Gonna Rock The Night Away
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby
Susie like to agitate
Maria hey hey Maria 
And after we all did?
There’ nothing left to do
Then Let Me Take A Bite
If you know it's a lie
The world's a better place 'cause you came in time,
Don't You Come Walkin'-
The Girl Was Dangerous
You Got Me Workin' Day And Night
There Are Ways
I've never known...
Lay back in my tenderness
Gonna lock you up
Girl, when the goin' gets mean
And it's enough love for me to stay
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
Love that's sweet and pure
A smooth criminal
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
we get to crippin’, its running in the early morn’
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine
I Found Out Right Away
Who Don't Wanna Teach
Ain't Nobody's Business
And that old north wind 
And Nothin' Really Matters
You Know
What a victorious thrill
Loving You
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)
So Open The Door
Music, music and me
I'm still all alone
It's causin' confusion
Is It My Brother!
Let Me Take You To The Max
And Don't Think Maybe (Yeah, Yeah)
on, what they gave me as my tools,
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
Do You Remember Girl
What Has Come Of
You persuaded me to love you
And together we can make it all the way
Keep on with the force don't stop (keep on now)
Go With It
Some Time
It was Sunday, what a black day
No Need For Rejection
You stayed my side
Keep It In The Closet
Miracles unheard of, hold on
She knew no one cared...
You Got To KnowWhen It's Good To Go
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
This Time I'm Trying Not To Go Too Far, Cause
In sight of me
We can't, we can't
Will I Do
(Insincere, empty tears)
You Look So Beautiful Tonight
That the magic slipper's
You can start again
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 
Cast The Spell
[2x]
Like A Sunset
You say you love me but it's hard to see
Am I amusing you 
But together we can be alright (alright).
Oh with a child's heart
Feel my sin
We Shall See
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
They don't care about the things you used to say
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
Keeping your head up to the sky,
I got rhythm and a whole lot of soul
