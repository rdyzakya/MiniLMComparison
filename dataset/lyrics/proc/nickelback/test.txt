And you can scream profanity
Yeah, argh I missed you so much
I can't trust my friends
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
You can take this anymore So just give it one more try
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
High, oh! (High, high)
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
Standing on the edge of a revolution Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution
And take it from someone who's been where your at
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
And every city in between
I'm ready to go
And a lime for her lips
Well, you can stick me in a hole
And I know you feel the same way, because you told me drunk on your birthday.
Always take a toll on the conscience
And I will survive, mmm
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
(The world needs this)
With mouths to feed
And where it lands is when it should
To see what time it is
And I'd fight for you
To see the signs that we missed
To drink everything in sight
The two of us should probably start to fight
Everybody says we need salvation
And wash it all away
Just to try to make me beg
I jumped in to save a girl
So I don't have to fight off
'Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution We'll all be dead if this shit don't change
But these stories carry on
(So what you need?) I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
Gotta run, gotta run
And I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the test I like the white stains on your dress
We dropped our guns and tried
Because they heard somebody screamin'
Is this what you came for, well this means war
Every regret is a gift that you live with
In a cafe on Main Street
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know (the one thing I know)
Leave us a coin for the ferryman Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill
She's got me runnin' round and round Light on Sunset, can't imagine the two ain't having fun yet
Never seen somebody move that way.
Looks like you found me
Speaking to the galaxy
Who will dig you out when you're six feet under And the only thing to save
Then it's always yes, yeah, (yes)
'Cause the river's been high and there ain't no goin' back
And I like the way you still say please
I can't believe it
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I won't be missing one more day,
Believe in every dream that you got
But she tasted like home
Invincible and so alive
Laid her body on the bar
Just to follow you home, yeah
Just tell me there's a chance
You must've broke down
I miss you so, so, I do If there was some way, you know I would
But here we are, we're here tonight Singing Amen, I'm alive (I'm alive)
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
It had to happen sometime
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo And I can't get enough of
We wanted easy, straight and now we'll never know
You came along, and tore this world out around me
Hand in hand forever
So I tried to call across the hall to ask you out someday
I'd even cut my hair and change my name 'Cause we all just wanna be big rock stars
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands. And we sang 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
Why's love gotta be so tough Oh, and now I guess I should've listened
But darling my shit moved across the country
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
So I doubt I'll figure out
Said "I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother"
A million miles an hour
Everybody needs a leap of faith
You can ride, you can fly, you can tell them that you drive
Make the whole world wait
'Cause we're not about to live in this mass delusion
We got no fear, no doubt, all in balls out We're going out tonight
Coca-Cola roller-coaster
Now it's too late to tell you I miss you so, so, I do
She'd try anything once, 'cause anything goes
When are you taking yours? What are you waiting for wow? You gotta go and reach for the top
I don't
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will
A fast one, now that the trees
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Show me!
She does for me, because it's what I'm dreaming of. (You and me, sitting in a tree.
But you can never keep me down) And I will survive
No, I don't Well, no, I don't find faith in your false feelings
Engine, engine, number nine
A million miles an hour I wanna do it 'till the sun comes up
Then it's always yes, yeah! (Yes) sex is always the answer, it's never a question,
Looks like we got another come along girl
And pray I'm never coming back And I'll stay alive
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
Cause we were good in bed
From cuttin' yourself with the jagged edge
And dream of ways to get higher
Hey, hey, I want to be a rock star
Ooooohhhhhhh
They'll never catch me
When you never pull it out
So, what you wanna do?
Gotta get me some. Stuck in a cage
Only makes me love you more And this kind of pain, only time takes away
Now I know just what that really means.
There's no way to sugarcoat it
As long as we're tied up together
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin' Show me what it's like
And I'd pretend
A gangster wanna be and baby that was him
It's just another day
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.
Haven't you heard don't hit a lady
And now you got to wonder
Only makes me love you more
Just to get high
Gotta get me some. I gotta get me some.
Doesn't want a lollipop
No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!) You pay with your life
While your passed out on the deck
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
'Cause I'm feelin' way too damn good And it's like Every time I turn around
And a king size tub big enough
This is how you remind me
I won't let you fall,
Every time we're together It's funny how we change
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I Every memory of lookin' out the back door
'Cause time itself is standing still
Blew every dollar that we ever made
I know you're wondering when
Are we having fun yet Yet, yet
I wonder what's up under there?
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out. (Bottoms up)
Say it if it's worth saving me I, I'm driving black on black
They think they'll get it inside her
(I miss you) God knows I do
You're laid out on the floor and you're not sure
Would you call old friends you never see?
And how it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad It's too bad it's too bad
I swear I still do
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh There's clothes all over my floor
Lately there's been too much of this
No one's waiting back home Well, home ain't what I'm callin'
That I'm the only gonna lick her tonight There's other places that are better to go
It's never too late
And the voices rang like the angels sing.
It's tough to see through bullshit when it's up above your eyes. Kiss it goodbye.
In the side of a bullet How could you take his life away?
Would you forgive your enemies?
They'll go and ask the DJ
This fool, this life
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit til it's dry.
And don't you be afraid if you fall
And now I scream about it
With our lives are better stolen
Why, 'cause I'm tired of waiting No, I don't
Thought a Playmate wanna join the party
Gotta get me some. God all mighty look at that body.
the same old conversaton
Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's (Yes).
That's probably 'cause there's only half worth telling
Unless I sing this song to you
And the best is yet to come So just give it one more try
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
The years have come and gone
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
I'm terrified that she'll wind up dead in his hands
She grabs the gun, she's had enough
Argh-argh-argh, yeah-yeah
Too hard to leave it If I could relive those days
If you ain't livin' on edge
I think I've forgotten One day, up to a cliff
Are we having fun yet
'cast all this, 'constint this battle
Every time you got onto me
(The world needs this) I'm through with standing in line
Everybody wants to know her name. And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.
And I just couldn't wait
Gotta be free
She looks at you, she wants the truth
But there ain't no going back
I watched the lying, turn into hiding
Already said goodbye, nothin' left to say
If today was your last day If today was your last day
I meant to say before you left
Her congressman will call her every once in a while
Just to get high Take one of those and two of these
We watch it happen over there
(Been there, done that) I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to It's trying not to love you, only goes so far
You say those same things to me
Then watch the walls begin to breathe
Don't you wanna really live your life?
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
Love her even though I'm not supposed to Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
But dreams just aren't enough
We're going out tonight
And every penny always turned into twenty
Someday, somehow
Never let me go, keep breathing
Don't ever let it end. Saturday I'm gonna take her out.
Pick me a lock
Looking like a rock star, and she likes to go out and Get her hands up.
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon You better hang on if your taggin' along
Get 'em up To line up to the ring
So why even try?
You know I'd always come for you No matter what gets in my way,
Make me believe again
Humpty Dumpty, do your thing
That's, that's, that's when we all win
Before I walk away,
She could take your fantasy and make it a reality.
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
'Cause you're my Mississippi princess
I got a fist full of fifties, the tequila just hit me
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore So far away, so far away
She's had a couple of kids since then
Your very own lullaby Well it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
Saying it's only 20 karats, it can't be that hard to find it, baby Your touch has made me a believer
A million miles an hour Insanity is setting in
Is that your hand?
Never too late to write the rest of your story
There's no giving in
Your daddy, your sister and your brother One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
So hard to swallow Hey who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky?
Ooh Addressing those beneath from high above
You were busy motorboatin' on that blonde girl
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
But I won't do this anymore, whoa
Make me believe again.
I can taste the colour of the lights
A world full of killing and blood spilling
Get 'em up
To be wrapped around your grave You've gone too far, who do you think you are
And try to take the path less traveled by
And teach them all to sing along Singing Amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Was it wrong
You grow up quick when ya grow up poor
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,
Bettin' that her skin smells better
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive oh Well my favorite little waitress has
And tomorrow was too late
Your very own lullaby
But he traded everything, for suffering
The blue skies we wait on
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
Gonna have to come after the rain (rain)
Give anything, but I won't give up
How could anyone ask for more? But if there's a pill to help me forget,
Sitting around, hanging out this afternoon
won't even miss you at all
Put a bounty on my head
Everyone is coming on to her
Must have wound up on the floor while
Stick your diamond ring where the sun don't shine Oh, it must be nice
Leave us a coin for the ferryman One more depending on a prayer
His ex girlfriend's friend was there alone.
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
Gonna have to come after the rain How could this affect my life?
In favorable slavery I guess it wasn't really right
Don't ever let it end. Don't let it end.
Whoa-oh, oh She says I'm only telling half of it
(watching us)
If everyone loved and nobody lied
High
And I hate the people that you know
Mama gonna let you set the moon on fire Jack be nimble, jack be quick
And I want to make him
Imagine what the world could be If everyone cared and nobody cried
I'd search forever just to bring you home,
You won't believe us until we're gone
Say it if it's worth saving me, hurry, I'm fallin' Say it for me, say it to me
That's when we all win
Until we're both so good and sweaty
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place Because somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else
And all I need is you
In the side of a bullet And in the wake of his mistake
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale One step, two step, electric slide
I'm like a love sick puppy chasing you around
And I forgive you, for being away for far too long
I can still hear ringing in my brain
No, we don't wanna hear another word you say
When you're going down on me
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
And every song that sings about it
Your ripping up the dance floor honey
And a handful of junkies
Only makes me love you more What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! Ooh, bottoms up. So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar.
Was there somebody else?
You can slap me in the face
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Well, I'll walk you home when the whole things done.
I sat at home, and on my own
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire.
The time we've lost can't get back
So what you really waiting for? (So what yo Everybody's gonna make mistakes
If you ain't afraid to try it
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought
For all the wrong reasons I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought
You can tamper with the brakes
With what we throw away
Come please, I'm callin'
All night (All night) Just one more moment, that's all that's needed,
Steppin' the oo back pay a visit
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
You got off
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
While we burn it to the ground tonight Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
(The way you swing)
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
Now I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do. Everything you want, anything at all, everything you want.
Don't they know it's never going to work?
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
While your looking up at me
(You're the only one who knows that) I know you're wondering when
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon I like your pants around your feet
One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older) Everybody says that life takes patience
'Cause I'm feelin' way too damn good Feelin' way too damn good Sometimes life ain't best if left in the memory
What are you, what are you waiting for?
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
Are you waiting for the perfect night
As we all fly away And they're watching us
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
I am so high, I can hear heaven
And I can't get enough of
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
So much cuter
It's tough to see through bullshit when it's up above your eyes Kiss it goodbye.
We drink all day until we fall down
('Ay oh ay oh' x2)
'Nother round, fill 'er up,
No longer held by gravity
Damn it I knew the second that you came up
And tell your brothers I'm in town
Love to hear the sound you make the second you're done. S is for the simple need.
Power absolutely all for show
Saw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it
When we could feed a starving world
When somethings clearly wrong
And made the world all wonder why
Now the story's played out like this
It was somebody's daughter
Regardless of who you are
Now I did, you wonder why And I know who you are
And you can leave me there for days And I'll stay alive
Don't you wanna love before you die?
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad It's too bad it's too bad
We were switching our positions
I love the way you dance with anybody
But it doesn't matter 'cause I made it up, forgive me now
Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town.
There's gotta be somebody for me out there You can't give up, (when you're looking for)
Gone for good, and this is it
Never forget to remember forgiveness Everybody says that life takes patience
Yeah, yeah
Things we always needed to say
Life's no race, it's a companion
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear
Say it if it's worth saving me Heaven's gates won't open up for me
What are you, what are you waiting for? Are you waiting for the right excuse?
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
He hit the stage so full of rage
What a perfect misses, my misses still eat McDonalds
Don't you wanna spread your wings and fly?
Watch as we all fly away And they're watching us
Love her even though I'm not supposed to. She keeps me up (I keep you up)
If I can be your satellite. Let's dance around this bedroom
And try and beat me half to death
