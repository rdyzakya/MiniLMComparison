I always knew it would come to this
Pain You know you're right
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
The way I do I don't have to think
And I can never have mine It's not mine
Return of the rat Return of the rat
I'm so horny but that's okay
In every way I love you (In every way I'll help you?)
Wish me light,
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack I like it, I'm not gonna crack
They come with a flash of light
I've been drawn into your magnetar pit trap trap
You'll never leave me, mama
He'll give you breathing holes,
I can't let you smother me
Make it sound now, make it full house, sad man Leader of the band
Don't expect me to lie
But it's okay to eat fish
This is out of our range and it's crude
She asks me to untie her
Living without you girl you'll only break my heart...
We've make a pact
I can feel it I can hold it I can rub it I can shape it
I am not chippin'
Your ears rang I was young my an' you were mine.
Starved without your skeleton key What is wrong with me?
That's what I did, I killed my toe After dinner, I had ice cream
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Lay them down easy
So what should I do? I'm on a plain
And wear a shield
I'm half the man I used to be
Sprinkled with emotion
Bi-polar opposites attract
Even if you had a sight
What the hell am I trying to say? It is now time
Kiss kiss
Don't expect me to cry for thee Monkey see, monkey do
Who's that lounging in my chair?
I couldn't chew my meat too good She said, well, don't you start your crying
Masturbate it
Ummmmm I don't care
Sunbeams are never made like me Don't expect me to cry
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But instead I had a dad I just want you to know that I
Smell her on you It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
When I
Never finished his sentence
I'll go out of my way
I never know if I said
Like disco lemonade I smell sex and candy here
Then you'll think you're happy. [Chorus:Repeat x2] And if you fool yourself,
He never said among them word
Return of the rat
a mullato
As an known enemy Take your time, hurry up
Stored deep inside me I formulate infinity
Don't expect me to cry,
That legendary divorce is such a bore Mom and dad went to a show
One more on the phone, my heart
and for this gift I feel blessed
I have been true
Cannot look me in the eyes
Blackmailed again
I might be dreaming,
Stay away Stay
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x2) Congratulations you have won
They kind with seashells driftwood and burlap
Yeah, yeah, yeah I like it, I'm not gonna crack
Indebted and so grateful
Find my nest of salt
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found god Yeah, yeah,
Something in the way
Everyone is hollow Pick me, pick me yea
(Alt: So dumb, so dumb) Dimension seven (x7) You better watch out
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
"I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
Smell her on you
If she ever comes down now
This is getting to be drone
Have your way And she might as well know I
They hung him on the cross for me
Queen of lies, today, my heart
Or arosed
And for this gift I feel blessed
But I see hers and they are blue
Biting silent as a man
And you'll think you're happy. [Chorus:]
And the drippings from the ceiling
Waste me
Do what they say
Started this mess, and oh, I seen them do it
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them onto the
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Over the past 62 years Then I'm going to get some plywood
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago
Oh, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Ummmmm Underneath the bridge
And I was thinkin' 'bout myself
As an old Memoria, memoria
Could never kind
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
You're the one I wanna refill In the someday what's that sound? This song is for lovers out there
I like you With eyes so dilated, I've became your pupil
Than a, blasphemy Hold me, I'm so pathetic
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups I've accumulated
Second-rate third degree burns What is wrong with me?
I don't have the right
Take time with a wounded hand -- Cause it likes to heal. I like to steal.
I do whip her in to land
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray).
You are the only one
All the styles of heresy
Hand out lobotomies
Here is another word that rhymes with shame You could do anything Your life is shit
They're in my head
Don't expect me to die for me When I'm feeling tired
I'm on aplain
Pee-pee pressed against my lips I'm ashamed
I sink and then some Bell on door clanks, come on in
Shoot the shit (aha)
We have some seed
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July I knew a lady who came from Duluth
The water is so yellow
And the work it took was fun Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
She just wants to love herself I will move away from here
Forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
One day when I was lost
Take time with a wounded hand -- Cause it likes to heal...I like to steal..
He'll cover you with grass
Weather changes moods
No one there to free my brother (Don't go there to free my brother?)
And retire on the profits
No recess No recess
But I have some glue
To please myself Polly wants a cracker
Nature is a whore
I don't need a host to live
You'll wallow in the shit,
If I may what is right,
No recess
I fell asleep and watched TV
Chew my meat for you
Surrealistic fantasy
They're coming from all sides of the country
Follow it far
I do keep a date with you I'll take advantage while
Think of how a castrated horse feels
Straight as an arrow
Pick me, pick me yea
Contradictionary lies
To prove they still
Broken hymen of your Highness, I'm left back
Rape me, rape me again
I won't weather it well
They bit him in the side
Don't hate you anymore
Burn me It's to potentially grade me
Something in the way, yeah
To sit and think about myself
Easily amused
To save little families
You have been told
As I want you to be
Wish away the pain
Just ain't the way it seems Can you feel my love buzz?
Your life is shit
Ecto-Skeletal
The tarp has sprung a leak
Summon time too see me,
Oh no, I know a dirty word Hello, hello, hello, how low
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more This is out of our range
I formulate infinity
She loves her more than he would ever know
What is what I need?
Shake it down easy, shake yourself, Suzy, come on Don't let me detain you
Where the sun don't ever shine
an albino
Take a rest as a friend
No I don't have a gun
Less is more, love is blind
God is gay Would you believe me when I tell you
And try to find some place to rest their bones
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I'm going where the cold wind blows In the pines, in the pines
I wanna be alone Come on over
She said Even if you have
And hang out on clouds
They hurt really bad
I can't see, I'm really scared
I'm anemic royalty I'll start this off
Don't be so selfish
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
With pain
He'll keep you in a jar,
They point in my way
(No I don't have a gun) And I swear that I don't have a gun
I had better wait They hung him on the cross
No I don't have a gun Memoria, memoria Load up on guns, bring your friends
Help me inhale
And always will until the end Hello, hello, hello, how low
We can build a tree
Makes me sick (aha)
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
Don't expect me to die for me Don't expect me to cry
Love gun, love gun You can't forget me baby
And take my family away
I'm not the only one Load up on guns bring your friends
Afraid, afraid of a ghost Even if you have
Towards anti-social
But I have a light
He'll cover you with grass,
I did not want what I have got
You know your rights
People freaking every day White lights, sitting inside
Than
Your enemy you were, my an' I was once.
