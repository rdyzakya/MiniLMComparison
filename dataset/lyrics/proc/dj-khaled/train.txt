Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?

Fresh bandanna when I'm blowin' mad trees
Let her push the Chevy, hogg thru city
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies

They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
They don't want me to have another anthem
(Get 'em up) I said I'm on one, DJ Khaled uh I'm getting so throwed
Now only thing realer, Escalade full of scrilla

Stay in your bum-ass duplex
Yeah I run it with killas homie, so what?

'Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood

I'm on my way
Kanye West Khaled and Pain [Chorus]
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
Turnt up to the max
Roc Nation! Freebandz! Secure the bag alert
Alicia Keys!
'Cause I do it, do it, do it

They don't want to see me blow yo
I won't change you up next season for another chick like they did Aunt Vivian
Before the rap shit, you gotta go dap 'em
Everyting me did a'start, them borrow.
My Benjamin said "fuck you"
It's all numeric
That I'ma stay even when I need to go head
Stick you're body out in my sister mercedes
And your stomach on flat flat
Get 'em right, get 'em right (the legacy continues)
What that mean?
Like I'm Puffy, then I say gimme the total
Du respect pour chaque jour
You the type that can make me prioritize
You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
It's a pleasure Hours upon hours, searching for a better way out
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
How I get it
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
She even hang around all my savages
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
I'm in the foreign, top off, look like I'm worried homie?
Pussy bomb when you cum, girl you blow up
One more time, fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
I'm busting out the sunroof, nigga, andalé!
They got rockin' every city them niggaz back pounds of that purp'
She the baddest in the club, and I'm willing to take it
I'm watching my peers
I still remain a dog
Bitch I'm from Dade County (I'ma be forever thuggin', baby)
Everyone of my doggs, where my Dickies in The Source
Aicha, Aicha, écoute-moi
When you take off the plug and the prices go down
How you got me makin' sticky faces
Boardin' a jet with a quart on my neck
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't
First I stand around and vomit
Now we gon' get fucked up
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'
I'm like, "Who's up?" Girls is used up
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
I'm 5 Mics, five points of light
Dade County stand up right now
(In this fight)
Two Peak Patek, no palay
Gotta chopper wit' a drum and one iced up
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it

YSL and Hermes and barely scratch the surface
The capital going up heavy in Florence
Yup, come to my city, that's where I be
We the Best Music! DJ Khaled You know I like 'em special made for me
There's nothing you can't do
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
The speed of sound, what's your life like?
Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
When everyone turned their back you showed me how much you care
Bih made a movie in 3D
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
And you know she looked like she was with her man
Girl you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sista
Miami on fire, you better be cautious
You know I'mma slaughter like I'm Jason
Fifty stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
So prove it I'll handle you
Perpetrating will get your head bust
Hold you down like I'm supposed to
I'm tryna make amends
You gotta vest i gotta a shell that'll go through
Like Ricky's the Ross
Unhh
Slow me down Oooh and I done make 'em act a fool for it
Ball hard but I'm too fine to fine this bitch
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you I wanna be where the commas will be
With your new bag on
I wonder how I keep finding these places
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
Top five, I'm the one, two, three, four
Alert, alert, alert, alert, alert, alert
I done iced out my charms (2ce, ice, woah, woah) I put VVS' in my Patek, who want static? (21)
Afraid they moments have past 'em
I'm the only one
Check out my car collection
Made a knot in the line
Black ain't going play wit em'

The one we spent five racks on
What the fuck you think you doin' thinkin' I ain't gonna get on this
Bitch I'm from Dade County (I'ma be forever thuggin', baby) [Trina]
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
From where success is the bare minimal
Cold-hearted, my blood boils
Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi baby
And they say time fly's, well mine's first class
And the evil and ignorant people
Tra-tra-trappin' out stolen vans with goals and plans
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating

Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
Then I drop down, show I'm gangsta again
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
Y'all niggas actin' feminine
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
Now my old Rolex tryna sue me
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out It's just the way it is, oh

I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Get on my level
Killaz they all in the Porsche, pourin' champagne on them hoes
Make you famous in this bitch soon as the camera flash If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged

All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy

You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
Doctor was looking at us talk

They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heard a nigga whacked him. He shouldn't have testified [Chorus]
Patek Philippe, the AP, 40 mil I'm all in
Don't know what went wrong with me, 'cause I keep talkin' bout money
They outside playing hopscotch
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers

Put it in my cup and let me medicate
Then tell me you gone kill for me
Diplomat on the fender of the phantom I'm the winner
I wish you would nigga (Woo!)

Always leavin' your panties or somethin' else
I pull up dripping like BB
A Kingston they come from, A Kingston they come through My mom is my hero
Upgrade from the 2 to the 4 door
Its hard not to notice me, we known globally
Won't take you for granted
Pull strings like a violin
Plus I'm fly, so I keep some bad bitches 'round me
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
I know I got the green light
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Mama say I'm trippin', daddy say I'm trippin'
The Feds tappin' my raps, got the keys to success
All of my youngins and we lit Get 'em right, get 'em right
Just turned down a four-million-dollar shoe deal
With lips like angelina
They take your soul out your body
Word up!to visit your ass,and you playin' shit like this up in my ears.
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring

Low iron but you pressed
Yeah, you know it's you and me now
I suspended these bitches
Welcome to my hood
Carol City on my mind, we mobbin' out the line
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Oh, oh, oh, ridin' slow
If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged
But that ass on "woah" My lil' baby on thick, thick
Still in the trap but like my bitches bougie
Mightier though Once I was young
O ill monkey F***

All the haters I can spot them from far
New Wraith with the stars in it
Rest in peace to Uncle Al

If you put in work like me, put your hands up! [Chorus]
Oh, oh, fessi fession, Get 'em right, get 'em right

And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
She loves the way, she loves the way it feels
Me and my mama taking over
Money still on my mind
Aicha, Aicha, t'en va pas

My ride was a bus named MARTA
If we ain't fucking then bitch, bon voyage

Niggas getting bust over "In God's We Trust"
She say she only fuckin' with them thugs
Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with
Spirit of love Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
