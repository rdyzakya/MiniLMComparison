Grabbing titties in the club pocket full of skittles
You know the after party and the niXgas put on rasheds shit

Money in the shoebox whats up with all these shoeboxes
Big wheels make it look a lil bulky
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit
Out of Time

And if she doesnt wear panties then Ill fuck her on sight

Speak to them Jazze
Takin over now Im takin over
And Im so New Orleans its like a motherfucker

And ur perception of me is so wrong
Assholes
Youre far from home so leave it alone
Long it wont stop till daytime come home
Damn theres no keepin up with the brother man

One life to live never ask for a mulligan
And Im just wishin

Equipped with no top on
She aint got a man but she is not alone
Juelz Santana
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move

Streets cold but the heat make me feel covered in em
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip
And say a prayer for everyday
Guard your body we warn the place we here
No weapon formed against Weezy shall prosper and
Fuck you bitch my shoes brand new
Baby they gon be
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato
Say my name baby pull my hair
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough
Think its over Bitch Im thinkin forward
Oh you know I got Currencys new album
Or short Cuban hoe with a fat ass though
You know I like dem old I might have yo momma with me
Stay outta rich kids business dont be buttin in
Cause I like ya simmons jeans
We Love All Yall Happy Mothers Day
Maybe its time to put this pssy on your sideburns

Shake and bake ricky bobby
Shout out to every dj bootleggers I made history anyway
Tell your words get me open
Get up your dope Im putting birdies out
And when we fuck Im keepin on my Nikes
Handle it like a standard
presidents act immortal but I know you see moneys not a problem
We dont fuss fight
Id like to spend the rest of my night with you
Be with wildass niXgas and I am the wildest
She gone ride this dick like the KentuckyDerby
On a new broad you still one to one
We can stare at the morning yup
Shell be so I be who I be thats me
That pussy came giftwrapped bow and a ribbon
And we can do what you really want
I got comin comin up
No snakes at the carter tell the gardener to cut the grass
I close one eye I look like a pirate fuck it
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
You can wash my plate an put it back in the cupboard
The ground is gone
I blow weed like its dust
I can baby I can hear your heart crying out for me
Hollygrove Dawg And I Feel Like Mating
I Cant Feel My Face is gettin started
And some say its the life I was given

Jae Millz

And now every once in a while her knees jerk
Your out there the same flowin like a bad river
Off a flow thats priceless I just got it appraised
To be losing and be hopeless
Brand new money Brand new boston
Your name is unimportant
At the Grammy awards with six hummers
I swear to God I aint nervous
And its happy hour
Put the dick in the middle make it wiggle for yall
Been done had cake day late like Ed Sullivan
Hammer on my side like I work in construction
But karma is a message
I should cut myself to see if my bloods red
Blaze as I gaze at the stars and ask the lord
Ocho Cinco
Because you throw a five I pitch a ten
