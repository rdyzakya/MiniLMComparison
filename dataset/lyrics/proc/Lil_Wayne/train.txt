Stay on the grind until the moneys automatic
And I dont even know which crowd Im on
Hid where all the killas hid at

And I take that flower
Stop talkin that shit and suck a niXga dick for an outfit ha
Just want some mouth and lip service
Take it out your pocket and show it then
You cant see me
Suck the dick til the shit in her chest
And they love the way I come out wit the gear
For some reason I cant seem to keep my eyes out your direction
