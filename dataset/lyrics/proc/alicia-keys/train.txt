Baby I know you're worth it
And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no Crazy to let my man go
And you'll never get a chance to experience, my lovin' (oh)
JW: Another bill from a killer turned a thrill into a tragedy CHORUS:
Hey yo black it's time again, yeah, yeah (New York, New York)
Please, send me an angel
That crazy love
I finally came 'round
Am I crawling in bed
And this is the one and only love I've ever known, so (How do you find the words to say, to say goodbye
Was all he ever had Well, how do I let go when I've loved him for so long
Another inch of your life
But once again these tears always win And it feels so good
This must be the dark before the dawn
It's like
Sólo como tú
And no needs, yes yes yes I need you
Feel it deep in your soul
Then put me in a love song (oh) What you gonna do when somebody convinces me
I'll never be perfect, but at least now I'm brave
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed So every time you hold me
Don't gotta do nothing else, oh oh
When it's all said and done, when it's all over
But still you said the love was gone
Can you send me an angel?
Oh baby, if there is anything that you fear (anything)
'Cause it's over
'Cause There's More To See (Unbreakable)
And I wanna go somewhere, go somewhere Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
For love of the babies (for love)
His tears
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
Telling me, touch me, feel me
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam
If I'm being honest with you
Me llena con su sentimiento Con sentimiento, vida llena
An Mikey madda fly him out, cause she get a loan
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
It's so hard to just let go
But I swear it's worth it, worth it That's what you do, what you do, what you do
That I must say, I've been looking forward to Look at me shedding no tears
We can have it all (We could have it all)
Wait til you see my smile
Now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
That wreckless love Let's go back in time
Love me like you'll never see me again Oh oh oh How many really know what love is'
It took a brave brave girl to try
And I don't care if you don't call no more (Said I
There would be no limit to my sorrow
Ev'ryone comes to stare at me
These king size sheets
Your secrets are safe with me
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Speaks to my heart
Half explaining to me
I wanna be there just to listen
From my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink
An mi here sey T did deh deh but him say he wasn't
To make your world a little brighter
Call 489-4608 and I'll be here I won't tell your secrets
Doubt the fact that I
Nobody around to make you safe
I'm the real thing, yeah, you gotta please me
Wasn't long before I be g-g-gone
Someone like you, someone like me
I still put on a vest
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth 'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
I don't know what I'd do without you babe Have you ever felt so strong
What nobody tell me
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Ooh, yeah
Never felt so alive
You saw it long ago
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears Is it my turn to wish you was lying here?
I was on my solo groove, I ain't want nothing, I ain't need nothing
My first teenage love affair My baby baby
That's how strong my love is He broke my heart
Fly, fly, ooh, just let her fly
With an S on my chest
Clap Your Hand
In the Streets of New York All I see is street homes
Telling me baby baby baby why
I dont worry cuz
Tú, dime a quién le cantas
'Cause I'm the juiciest, baby (Uh-huh), girl around
You say he's cheatin,' want me to leave him
This Love Is Unbreakable(Ha,Ha,Ha,Yeah,Yeah)
Something so divine (so divine)
Yet you beg her to love you
But it's sun rise and I'm still in your bed
When you wanted to know my every move
And now the whole community can live greatly
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
But reality wasn't just you and I
Every day I'm feeling better cause I know I got the best I can be proud of
But I'm lying to myself
How come you don't call me Na na na na no
Wish there was somewhere to hide
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
So we can do this all night, one time
You look surprised, your words don't burn me anymore
I got a pocketful of dreams
The things we try that others just won't do Look at me shedding no tears
And you just can't sleep Have you ever been so sure
It's too bad its so sad
Preachers pray to God
Here you can be yourself
You treat me cold
But Y'all Know We'll Be Back Next Week
So I call it a lesson learned I keep your picture upside my bed (umm)
And the moonlight gets exposure
Given him all that I could? Was it something wrong that we did?
And all that matters I'm telling you
You're beside me
And even when I'm tired, gold is the only word i know And the night is takin' over
It's too bad its too bad
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Trying to find a better way So we can heal
I'm singing for someone Someone like you
And the fortunes of love we make I will be the water you need in the desert land
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what's within
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you
I can't stay, I can't stay away This invisible bullet and it takes us to the stars
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Look at you, look at you
But I don't plan to let him go for Jane Doe, oh oh 'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
When they ask me how I spent my life
Driving in a fast car
So how could you
Now I hope it stays and last forever
I wanna take my time and right the wrong before we get to that place I wanna tell you something, give you something
Cause I been missing you like crazy Don't wanna go all night,
Searching just to find that someone
Come back to me
This was for sure
I wanna let you know
Oh, maybe we could care a little more
A chance to make it through In a world that seems to get colder and colder
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears If I had no more time
Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
He may not be the perfect man
We take it from the bottom to the top baby
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know) Oh, baby, baby, baby
And I'd call you back for more If I was your woman
Your secrets, your secrets, break it down
Real love, but you doin' it right, alright
Lets Do It ,You Ready?
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
Sometimes I love ya
She's just a girl, and she's on fire Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care
But once again these tears always win Crying like oh oh
'Cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
My first teenage love affair Another secret meeting
I gotta go home now
Now who's cryin, desirin' to come back to me
From the fire we make
Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
You can't stay away
But you don't really need them
Now we, gonna take it higher
It's too bad it don't matter baby
'Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
Aye, if you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no I love my man
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you Yeah I'd die without you
If you really want me, like you say you want me
The sky can't wait, for the light of the sun
It's gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
All I need is you in my life
Being alone will make you realize
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out If you love me baby, work it out
This lovin is a crime
Gotta work it baby, work it out
To say, to say (to say goodbye) goodbye
New day
'Cause I'm the juiciest, baby, girl around
You must be messed up too We used to talk 'til midnight
There will never be two things
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth No need to read between the lines spelled out for you (spelled out for you)
Loosing dignity
God know something had to change
When it seems your faith has broken
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
Oh oh oh oh She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Stolen moments with you (oh oh) Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid
Yes I can I am a Superwoman
Find the words to say goodbye) Is this the end? Are you sure?
Cause baby This bed
And my heart is hurting
Even when they're right there
And a heavy load to bare
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Sing Ooh
Hey yo black it's time If you knew my streets
Higher I am riding high
I'm talking bout
I think you're perfect
I'm gonna give it my all, oh
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
It is this a part of destiny, you're now in my life (now in my life)
Who's it gonna be?
Be Rich Like Oprah And Steadman
I love you Don't you ever,
Trying to find my way
I'm singing for somebody like you
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
We can risk it all
By the second, losin' focus
I'm not waiting for your okay
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
And that's the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter
We get to go (Higher)
Politics manipulate and press yutes button
Yeah, we can hate each other and fear each other
And the high place I'll bring down. And the high place I'll bring down. Mm, bye bye How do you love someone
And burn the hole inside you From the fire we make
Can't let it get me down It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
If you could love somebody like me
Ooh Don't look no further
Here's my survival story (story)
You knew he had to go
Leave me all alone
I am riding high
And how I cried and tried
I'm saying woo-ooh (woo-ooh)
And it goes around
Says you're nothing at all
Gotta stop cryin', to come back to me (Goes around, comes around
Like a ship through the storm
Some lies
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind Dreamin' bout you
I know how hard it gets
Rah, rah, rah, rah Here's my ghetto story (story)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
Turn the darkness to the light With the fire we make
With intentions good?
To fully realize
That's how strong my love is
Why don't you hold me, need me
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no 'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
That's not the only reason I'm here for ya I think you're beautiful
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
And like a fairy tale your story begins
That would be enough And if this child
And you can walk a million miles
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
If you could let me inside your heart Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
'Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time, ooh Oh baby, baby, baby
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
Sweetly control me
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I were your woman
And where my heart take me I follow, you gotta follow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Have you ever try sleeping with a broken heart?
Celebrate and say
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers, waste another hour let alone another day
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Hear it from New York! She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Millions never will
So till the end of time
Been in hell through the fire
Is too lonely without you, too lonely Well people don't see, what I see
Everything that I been looking for I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
I'm just tryna find where I belong
Man I'm good, now I'm speechless, cause I fell for it, the poet in me died cause I fell for it I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
You can try but you'll never forget her name
Tired to keep it smooth

But I can fly
Mistake overturned
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk no
When you said goodbye! All at once
And I don't wanna know
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights Dreamin' bout you
Who came home, who still gone, who restin' in peace Now they killin' over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it
I remember when Danny dem take me snow cone (hey)

To have, all my affection
Like the mountain standing tall
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you (Kissin' you)
I could barely find a dolla for a token
To all the lovers who cant be together
Just stay alive
spreading her wings and her song?
Rah, rah, rah, rah We got the kingdom so we got to make way
(See we don't really know)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Another girl

You'd have no other woman
Nah
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (first baby)
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
Just think of me as the pages in your diary Everybody say woo (woo)
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
Waiting for your love Talking on the phone
If you ask me I'm ready
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Gonna make it someday gonna be somebody
Even when stability's never in your favor
We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
I?m telling you that No one no one no one
Where nothing ever seems to matter
Every night I sigh
All I'm saying is love is what I'm looking for
Just to do things for you
We can break these walls between each other
If you want me baby, work it out
And cause me so much pain
We can get away
Trigger finger
Pon la oreja, nena

And no longer were you with me
If I could make it here
That may you feel weak
My lows, i know i know, its mind control
The way that I love you Oh, oh, I never felt this way
Every time you touch me
Stand strong and you will grow Ooh
JW & AK: Another man that stands right behind you looking in the mirror [CHORUS] Its just another way Suit em up, bang bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang. Said I'd be gone by five

Will you take a train, to meet me where I am
Then write it in a letter for me (oh oh oh)

It's such a lonely road [Chorus: x2]
Since you're gone I shoulda been there
No one no one no one
But me you won't ask If I were your woman
Kick you while you are on the ground
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no Just crazy to let my man go
That's how strong my love is (love is) Through the deepest water
And I don't care if you don't call no more
Yes yes yes I need you
One life left to live it up There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Another gun thrown down
I can't say I came prepared

There's no limitation, no
Promise that you'll love me
Another one
It only happens once to me when I call
When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say [Chorus]

Woah, woah, hallelujah
Keep yourself open, yourself open
That you can believe in me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall I keep on fallin'

When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam
Just live in the moment
Look at where you started

So you will always know Through a shake of an earthquake
An, Mikey madda fly him out, cause she get a loan (hey)
Since you're gone I know I pushed you away
May let me rest my head
And leave the world behind [Chorus] Let's get away
But they can't light the room they way you did
It's too bad cause love is blind
Think like that
(Ho...)
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting Oh oh oh, oh
You'd be happy to see me smile
Tru' mi dey a foreign now a guy kill me cousin
Greed still the cousin of death Always feels like always somethin' farther time
Long nights
And tuck me in before I go to bed Say now baby girl you're better off
Another lesson learned Sometimes
If you will stay with me Every little bit hurts
I used to miss you, now I'm glad that you're gone, I,
Through it all Remembering the days when our love began
You know I don't like to be alone
And your family? (Me and your family?)
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
Now we got the keys to the kingdom Jamaica get screw tru greed an glutton
I'm gonna give it my all Party people say, party people say, "Aye
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny I remember playin' over needles in the streets
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you If I were your woman
Can you send me an angel? To guide me, to guide me home
Tell you, I love you and you not hear me
I can still feel you in my bed
Hail a gypsy-cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
And all the time, you were telling me lies So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
The sunshine
Run my bubble bath
Ooh Let's go back in time
We just could not
Another way to die
Baby you know I'm worth it
Pappa, now you're gone
For a new day, for a new day,
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
To you, I'm a toy
Sólo como tú, oh, my sister
I'm not easy, yeah, you gotta work for it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera So New York City walk with me, talk gritty
I just wanna stay with you
No food to eat
If you ask me I'm ready Why give up before we try
Oh don't you know that I would, die without you
I'm singing for someone
You don't know my name
Nothing really matters
Is you and me only
But I'm too afraid to show it If I were your woman
(Yeah...yeah...)
If I couldn't feel your touch
One day we will get out of this misery (hey!) We get di ting dem, dem outta luck now
I know, i know, my pride, my ghost, my eyes
I remember so the avenue tun inna war zone
But everything's alright with me and ya Mama
(I wanna hold ya, hold ya)
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life left to live it up
To escape and be with you
Baby dial your number
(I love you, I love you)
I wear it on my shoulders
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
Take these material things
Messed up too, messed up too
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late I wanna tell you something, give you something
(Celebrate) and say Check it out
And it's a long, long way to heaven
Your inspiration gets me through So I won't lie
How come you don't call me, anymore Still like a fire on a rainy night
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
And it's going so right
I'm Singing This Love Is Unbreakable I keep your picture upside my bed (umm)
A woman walking by
Sellin' bodies for doh
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
It's getting kind of crazy
'Cause there's something about you there Speaks to my heart
Doing everything that makes me smile
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Feel like I feel
And you'll never know how good it feels
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, I don't care)
Everythings gonna be alright
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Everybody wants to be adored
Oh die without you, die without you babe
Wanna be with you forever Don't wanna go all night,
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Can't take it anymore I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
I guess I was wrong (oh)
You would finally realize
I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah I used to know all the words to say, I used to write all the poetry
I can't stay away
Sometimes I feel
Tryna keep it all together
And can feel your heart beat I never known this feeling never
A little hesitant Let's go back there
With her finger
Separated by distance and time You were always on my mind
And I will never leave Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
I'm not expecting sorry
These arms are wantin' you (Wantin' you)
It's like I'm going insane The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
Hobos after me, runnin' like I'm smokin'
No matter how long it takes him
I wanna know yeah Hey baby how you doing tonight
Everywhere I go a man want some part of me
Worth! 'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
That I want, or need to be without you
Because thugs with no brains got no patience
That would be enough We don't need a legacy
Do you know until you lose it That it's everything that we are looking for
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
(I wanna be here)
That I don't really care
If you noticed that I'm different
Baby, see I would die without, I'd die without you
Find the words to say goodbye) How do you find the words to say
So you think you're hot?
But they can't take your place
For real, drop the beat
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
I see us on our first date
In the midst of all this darkness, i sacrifice my ego
And my dream's still unphased
Ow! Party people say, party people say, "Aye
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
So til the end of time I'm telling you there is no one No one, no one, no one
When I cry your name
I shoulda been there, I shoulda, I shoulda All at once
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And I start to get weak
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no Hey I might not really be your mother
Won't you come be in the sky with me I was wondering maybe
Looking for paradise
I'm back on solid ground
I bet you wonder how I go on The work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop
Maybe we could care a little more
And what good would it be
Than to give you all that you desire
If you never play me
All of the things that you wanna do
Yeah....... (Unbreakable)
I say yeah yeah Nasty, yeah, yeah (New York, New York)
Come here, yeah, yeah (New York, New York)
There is nothing that I would not do (Crazy world of mine)
I won't tell (I won't tell) I won't tell (I won't tell)
What went wrong with something once so good? How do you find the words to say
How could age define
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked Oh, maybe we should love somebody
Giving up what seems your lifetime
Oh yeah, all I wanna know yeah
You must be messed up too Everybody say oh oh oh oh
Promise not to bluff
Trying to get somewhere
Don't you ever,
It took a brave, brave girl to try
Eh eh Ay yo, Alicia
Y'all Know We'll Be Breaking Up But We Just Might Be Back Next Week
I don't know how you can be driving me so crazy boy
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
There's nothing you can't do
Big schemes Oh, it's like the game
Rah, rah, rah, rah I remember those days when we was dead broke an
What a heart of stone would bring But that's a lonely road to travel
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if love is holy and hate obscene
And surrendered
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised if i talk a little louder
I'm stressing that we have to go back there
We can fly, ooh I am a Superwoman
If I ain't got you baby
We can build these walls between each other
She's walking on fire
Tell me do you feel the same? Everybody say Party people say, party people say, "Aye
What about you
Thinking how much can you take
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
Golden tone voice
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own
Wanna have your voice in my ear till mama come and say its too late
You'd always have some sorry excuse
In between 'em, yeah
And I been thinking about you lately
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me boy I won't tell your secrets
Now you're in New York
You could buy me pearls
And it was raining
And she's not backing down This girl is on fire
Cause We get di ting dem Dem outta luck now
What can I do that would save our love
You can be sure
When everything in this room reminds me of you (You)
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
But, Mikey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone (hey)
No one, no one, no one
Doing nothing I've ever done
Me underneath these clothes
And tell you all that comes to me
And She Ain't No Different From Me
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
And moving over here to stay
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
Trying to make some sense
I can't wait for the first time
Someone that you think
Everybody say hey hey hey hey I'm just tryna hold onto to a dream
Yo canto para alguien
Out here lost and nothing's what it seems
I'm gonna make sure our bond gets stronger
Inside I'd die without you, yeah babe Oh I apologize for all the things I've done
Than you and me North needs south east needs west,
This I know for certain
Please be beside me
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Took away your fear
Woman's (woman's)
Unless you
I thought that you'd be happy
I bet you wonder how I go on Some people live for the fortune
Feel like no one's around
I still like it better when you holding me tight
Listen I don't wanna say
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
And it's a lonely world
And I can't take it
To come home before the sun
People keep talking they can say what they like
What about you?
Oh oh oh oh
Like joy needs pain Some people live for the fortune
Let her fly, fly, fly
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
It is what we make it
Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more
(that's how strong my love my love is)
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
But everything means nothing
That's why I say that I know why
Oh is anybody out there
It's too bad its so sad See people don't know, what I know
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
The way that I love you I'm fallin'
You don't my name You don't know my name
Distance and time, I'll be waiting Distance and time, I'll be waiting
You wanna be the one
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone
In the Streets of New York (New York state of mind)
I could make it anywhere
Let's take it there. When you
So maybe we can go to first base
So We Got To Live Our Dreams
Baby, I'm from [Chorus]
(Like you'll never see me again) Oh oh oh oh oh This song is dedicated
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
If I couldn't find you there
I put up a fight
(Now I'm glad that you're gone) Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more
Yeah, yeah Life is so crazy
Her mothers supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
Just dissin' my man and our relations
Waiting for your love
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if sex was holy and war was obscene
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know) I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
so she can fly, fly, fly
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
You don't have to settle for being enough Back to life
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
It's too bad 'cause love is blind Eh eh eh
It's just another way
Baby, baby I swear
But wings don't hear me out
And you're the boy
There are sirens all around
Hottest of the hottest girls say
But once again these tears always win
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Are you on your way?
Cause I wanna holla
Lets Do It Like This, Come On See, We Could Act Out Like Will And Jada(Will And Jada)
Back to life, life, I've been waiting for all of my life
Ooh....... New York x2 Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
(Find the words to say goodbye)
I can't stay away, say is, no no (yeah)
I just can't stay away
That promises forever young
Will she hang on your mind You're a part of me
And how you need your space
It feels kinda crazy These covers
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
I can verify that you're my type
State of crime (New York City)
Sing It One More Time Now
I wanna hold you Don't wanna go all night,
Man, these Jane Does be killing me thinking they slick wit it
(Me too far gone, to find my way home) [Chorus] Where do we go from here?
I were your woman We're at the crossroads, my dear
And not see what what I feel inside
I know people will try
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
(What goes around, comes around
And no needs, yes yes yes
Until that night in bed
Through the days and nights I don't worry 'cause
How come you don't call me anymore Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
Like a dove with no wings
'Cause you are taking over my mind And it feels like ooh
If you ask me I'm ready I keep on fallin'
Stay away Hi baby, won't you tell me the truth
Don't be surprised, oh see you look surprised Hey, if you were a friend, you want to get know me again
But now you take my breath away, hahaha, hey. Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
But I can't explain
At least I got to love you, when it's all over
I'm over the edge, no turning back
I need you
Big lights will inspire you
And I will never do anything to hurt you
And never do what you supposed to do
Will you ever know? You could buy me diamonds
That you know you got me under wraps, locks and keys and
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either ways
peoples who is juicy I want you to say, "Yeah")
Say you want me, say you want me
When she lets you fall 'Cause you're like a diamond
Manhattan squeezin' off, from cats who tease with war The eve of the Apocalypse, evil keep movin' politics
Oh oh oh oh I'll be waiting
'cause There's More To See(Unbreakable)
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out, sing! When the wind is blowing in your face
You must be messed up too Messed up too, messed up too
Second base
If you really looked inside
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Every step makes me think that I'm closer
Want u to be my first my last my ending and beginning
Te damos con la voz tus alas
You never come through (Now you) wanna be up under me
To say goodbye When I wake up in the morning baby
When your heart don't have the heart to say
Just ain't the same
I know i could prosper, no impostor
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Hey
I will survive
Had to grab my heart back
Don't let any emotions show, hmm People always speculate
That's how strong my love is I use to feel kinda lonely
You know I really like being with you
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
Wait til they see your smile Hey
That gave you cold feet
Oh baby This bed
Back to life
And feet are off the ground Say I never knew this feeling, never
And you were my man
But you don't even know it
I used to have your picture hangin' on my wall
Some just want everything
Or Give Back Like Bill And Camille
So I call it a lesson learned
Yeah... No Thing, No Money, No Sin, No Temptation,Talking 'Bout Nothing
Looking in the mirror A door left open
Bck to life
Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
If we gonna do something 'bout it
State of mind (New York City)
All that frontin' and that's not how you do it
In the story they will write someday
You give it one more chance
Just like you, just like you We got way too much in common
But didn't know until you were found
I remember so the avenue tun inna warzone (hey)
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me We're at the crossroads, my dear
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
And I don't care if you don't call no more We used to light a fire on a rainy night
You're racing to the door
To be alive right now
JW: Another dirty money, heaven sent honey turning on a dime [CHORUS] Its just another way to Hey Its just another way to Youve got to. JW: Another girl with her finger on the world singing do what you wanna hear
About everything they've witnessed
Can't compare to you
For your brother
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Don't have no reasons 'cause relief is hard to find In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
This girl is on fire Everybody stands, as she goes by
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me Can't wait till I get home
If I ain't got you with me baby Ooh....... New York x2 Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
When seeing your ID on mine
No Thing, No Money, No Sin, No Temptation,Talking 'Bout Nothing
Please forgive me for my sins
Every night I wonder why
We can chase this on
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave.
We'll celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more
We just could not get enough of it baby , let's go Have that wreckless love
Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied
Rah, rah, rah, rah I remember those days when hell was my home (oh)
And Have Enough Kids To Make A Band Like Joe And Catherine, Yeah She Ain't No Different From Me
This girl is on fire Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
Tell me how could you, doubt the fact that I
So heavy hearted
I'll give you all of my time Sometimes I feel
Then put me in a love song (oh) Gotta work it baby, work it out
I could still hear inside my head
Prettiest things imagine up, oh yea
(Oh Yeah Yeah) And We Got To Stay Tuned
Smalls is juicy) 'Cause I'm the juiciest, baby (Mmm), girl around
You must be messed up too
But make sure your love for me's true to you
It's the fire we make, (it's the fire we make)
Prosecute my posture
Show you in so many ways
That I would want someone to hold me
Another way to die Hey
And I swear it baby, it feels like ooh
I write your name in my book your last name my first I'm your Mrs.
I can't go on giving my life away
But I got something for you, Doe
Crack bein' raw, gats squeezin' off
When you walked inside, oh baby If these walls could sing
Just crazy to let my man go
If you really need me like you say you need me
We Just Might Be Breaking Up
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, ...you, ...you
Hail a gypsy cab
the caged bird sings
When it's over!
Come On, Keep It Going
Or Instead Struggle Like Flow And James Evans
Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more 'Cause I'm the juiciest, baby, girl around (Girl around)
If you need me baby, work it out
There is no room for selfish, we do it for the people And the night is takin' over
Keepin' up with me
And I've given him all that I could? Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Let the water rise and fall, oh
But I got somethin' else for you Baby, I used to sit home waitin' for your call
Flacko care, nobody else care
Why you wanna go and break my heart
My first teenage love affair Hey boy
Daydreamin' about you all day in school cant concentrate
Distance and time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
But I don't want nothing at all
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
I'll be waiting And if you have to walk a million miles
Oh and am I waiting only to drown in pain
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you You wore the crown, you made my body feel heaven bound
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
And I'm not tryin' to take away, oh no
And I don't wanna hesitate Imagine there was no tomorrow
You and me together
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, hallelujah
I know that nothing last forever, however
Finally you're only mine Each and everyday
Just hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value (better value)
Oh, got our head in the clouds
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
On the world singing
You make me rely true love
It's now or never at all
Wait til they see your smile Ooh
That felt all bare
Because I feel you
I hang my head from sorrow
Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more Ay yo B, What up A?
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting
That you don't want me anymore
Feels so good to not be searching
(Crazy world of mine)
On the fifth floor staircase
To be everything that I'd be looking for
Getting sweeter and sweeter
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Hey, ask when I wanna leave
Just think of me as the pages in your diary I feel such a connection
No place in the world that can compared
Every time you kiss me
We don't need money
See they say things they don't know Ooh
I don't wanna wait till the storm and something wrong and now you're gone and I can't find you I wanna tell you something, give you something
This would be enough Said, I would be enough
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
Everybody said, everybody said, that we should never part, no no
No more looking back only straight up
And this could be enough
To hold my mind, and be the kind
We both know we had no patience together day and night
When the risk it took to remain tightly closed in a bud
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Don't you do it
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth Here's my ghetto story (story)
Can get in the way of what I feel I know some people search the world
Through The Technical Difficulties(Unbreakable)
Oh, take every little piece of my heart (Piece of my heart)
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn' And when you came home
Think you slick like I wouldn't know
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say [Chorus] Dreamin' bout you
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone
All I wanna know is baby, if what we had was good
Just when I think
I used to like it when you'd come and hold me tight
(I wanna hold you, hold you)
Take me on a cruise around the world
Anytime mi fly down him a get bout dozen
I don't walk with you right by my side
And it seems like fate has spoken
Yo canto para alguien como tú
Never felt this way about loving
It makes me want you, call it what you want
Take every little piece of my mind
Knowing that I found that right one I'm waiting for your love
I don?t worry 'cause
Break It Down, Break It Down Like This
Light up my room at night
You say you're coming home
Looking for innocence
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free Careful with your ego, he's the one that we should blame
Was more painfully than the risk it took to bloom
I'm just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away
I need that love
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam (hey)
(See everyday we never know)
Another way to die JW: Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one that will never see the sunshine
From the day I saw you
And I don't care if you don't call no more (Biggie
You, I need you
They say I'm losing my mind
All I need is you in my life 'Cause I never felt this way about loving
Didn't know me
Noise is always loud
they keep away the lonely When I look into your eyes
It's crazy
Don't you make no excuse
Standing next to me
There is no better prize
But when it's time to do for me
What in the world am I to do? 'Cause I won't lie
Keep yourself open, you're open So maybe we should love somebody
Makes me so confused I keep on fallin'
Like a night to a day
If I were your woman Here's what I'd do
Yeah, you hurt me
I will be the woman you need to be a better man
Since you're gone Get so caught up everyday
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn'
Na na na na no
Loved him for so long and I've
'Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
Oh oh oh Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
We got way too much in common
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
New York, New York, New York, New York oh
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
That it would never come down
Entonces me ato a las estrellas Y al mundo entero le doy vueltas
With the slick
All you have to do is see
I'd risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly I am riding high
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
That's how strong my love is Oh, can nothing break us down
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Moment of honesty
Want you to feel me too boy
Drop it on me
It's getting hotter and hotter
Another lesson learned Life perfect
I'm gonna sit right here
Turning on a dime Well, a door left open
I know who I married
For her majesty
Don't take it personally
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth If you treat me fairly
Heaven sent honey
Baby better show me, baby better come and say Say you love me, say you love me
Thirty seconds to apologize
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Where you can stay forever
These eyes put up a fight
If I were your woman
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Woah, woah, let me in
For falling in love with you
I love you Don't you ever, think like that.
Darling, you'll see
Baby, I'm from New York
You will ever hear me say
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
Go inside where we can be together
Can you send an angel?
Through distance and time
Nurse our wounds before they scar There will never come a day
I wanna love you baby
You ought to see me now Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned
Just so came there to you
Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone
'Cause they never gonna hold me tight And these pillows
Wishing we could do it, oh (Do it right)
Hop in the train to just get where I'm going
Sometimes you make me blue
Every hood in every state
No no no The sand loves when, the waves come
They don't mean nothing
I don't worry 'cause
spread beauty, mm Here I am
Its a matter of extreme importance
Falling down ain't falling down
But once again these tears always win These candles
You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
Clap Your Hands
A phone on the table
So you're doing better now
In the nick of time
If I can lift my head and face another day
Inquieto, solo y confundido
Dirty Dirty hookas and hoes on 11th avenue
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
You're confusing me, what you say to me
And we're burning it down
('Cause they gotta have sweet now)
You wake up in a sweat
Yeah, you won't let me go Every little hurt counts
Would you cherish what we had'
What we want? Want them to say, whoo! Say you love me, say you love me
A ese corazón herido
They just don't know how good it feels Feels so good to not be searching
Everythings going to be alright
We Might Have To Take A Break But Y'all Know We'll Be Back Next Week
'Cause my lovin' feels like Ooh
At least I got to love you Everybody say hey hey hey hey
It's a New York State of Mind New York, New York, New York
'Cause the world it can be so fake
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
You wanna love somebody like me?
In and out of love with you
He will show When your head is in a certain place
If you don't call me, pappa
When I look at you I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
I will keep (I will keep) your secrets (your secrets)
Don't play with me, don't play with me, 'cause (What goes around, comes around
Is too lonely without you (Baby)
All in love is fair I shoulda been there
So long as you come home at the end of the day
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah In New York
Could I make you my baby
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
What is wrong I'll make it right before you,
An adventure not perfected
Then put me in a love song (oh) If you say you want me, yeah,
Baptized in boundaries, schooled in sin
We can have it anywhere
For the better part of me
C'mon New York, New York, New York, New York oh
Forgiveness is the only real revenge Oh, so we can heal each other and fill each other
I couldn't know if
This blended family, but baby
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you
But, Mikey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
You'd be weak as a lamb If you had the strength
If I was your woman Here's what I'd do
Baby everybody here you know adores ya I think it's beautiful
He loves me more
Estoy buscando ese momento
Yet you'd never phone
Can get in the way of what I feel for you Yeah
AK: Another gun thrown down and surrendered took away your fear
How do you give me so much pleasure
Hey hey hey
We're Living Our Dreams We're Living Our Dreams(We're Living Our Dreams)
No place in the world that can compare
I wanna tell you really
When forever was a minute, and eternity was a second
Yo canto para ti
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And let some other Jane Doe
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
I think it's perfect
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Sneak around and lie
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth 'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
We can risk it all (we can risk it all)
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no
I swear, it feels like ooh
This girl is on fire
I risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All I do is count the days
Let's take it there When you
But once again these tears always win Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over (Gonna be over)
When we had our first kiss
And we're not coming down This girl is on fire
Nothing really matters There's no other way
The world don't stop, it's on again I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Never seen this part of me
A look in the eye
Let's do it like this, uh If I was your woman
When our kiss was brand new
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
Long as there's another day here will be another way
And then your fantasy
And love is unkind
I love you,
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
At least I got to love you, hey
I've changed my mind, I think I'll keep him
It may not be easy
How should you know
And it's gonna take so long
Like the moon in the sky
I've taken more than would a fool
Oh we can look to infinity
Or Like Kimora And Russell Makin' Paper, Oh Yeah
Your eyes
There ain't nothing I won't do for us (For you baby)
Woah, woah, let me in
(He's Kool-Aid)
Lovin' you darlin'
Don't you worry cause
What you finally see know In the room full of people
But I gotta get there
And who it's holdin', our people
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright No one, no one, no one
What you do for love, love For love, for love
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
with so much joy and reverie
caged without a key
So all I can say I wanna tell you something, give you something
But wings don't here me out
Big dreams (New York City)
But all I know is everything's going to be alright No one, no one, no one
At times I feel used
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
Back in time
Say yes I will
Look around, look around Look at where you are
I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson
Can't you see that I would die without you? If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
These streets will make you feel brand new
Baby
So can't we try
That it will only get better
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
And you don't my name
And hates how you try to talk to me I'm like you're don't even there try
I used to believe we would never part, no
Is it my turn to totally understand?
Uh, you know, hey
Oh oh We can get away
Baby when you're in town, why don't you come around boy
I remember when we run, Fatta get him knee blown (hey)
But I'll pick you up darling
'Cause baby you know I'm worth it Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right
What a saint to the ... I'm just speechless baby, don't know what to say
If a bird don't fly, then what were wings made for?
Sometimes I feel good
Someone that you think that you can trust is just
Another bill
Every little hurt counts
Just to spend time alone
Todo el mundo va buscando ese lugar
You say you want me
Since I'm being honest with you Who wants to love somebody like me?
(Crazy world of mine) Come join this crazy world of mine
Come On We Could Fight Like Ike And Tina
In and out of love
But she treats you like glass
I couldn't know how
(Who could this be? Staring at me)
If you show me baby believe
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause these lips ain't kissin' you
Where are you now? JW: Another ringer with the slick trigger finger for Her Majesty
Aye, come alive let's get it
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you Some people live for the fortune
Can't get away (get away), epidemic plague
Up needs down life needs death,
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
I'm suspended in the air
Show me like you, falling in a daze
How 'bout you 'splain what that's all about
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin Oh, so we can hate each other and fear each other
Even when I'm a mess
And that without you I just, I'm gonna be lost
A woman's (woman's)
I remember when Danny dem take me snow cone
For me to get somewhere
Ooh it's such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
You should say it right now You give me a feeling that I never felt before
Yeah, Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah
For better days to come
Hold my hand
It's called the past cause I'm getting past
And I swear it feels like
Oh, I'm not meant to be locked up
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
But instead we have to hide
Mind stressin' tryin' to find a record crime shreddin'
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of free
Long days
Oh, you got to try
Said it's alright!
Somethin' special 'bout you
From a killer
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
Baby, I'm from [Chorus: x2] One hand in the air for the big city
(Now you) have so much to say to me, hey
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Part of my plans and part of my mind
Higher
At least I got to love you, at least I got to love you Everybody say hey hey hey hey If I do nothing else, oh
All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no Don't you turn and check my man out
(Find the words to say goodbye) I know now I was naive
Thinkin' of a million ways
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home No matter how far you are
Alicia Keys
Only comforts the brain
Try to divide
I'd rather do the time
Watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel,
Talk to me Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Do what you want here
Please don't ever loose a faith and don't fall under In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Something so real
Yeah Have you ever felt so lost
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
That will never see
Nothing can break you
Stay with me
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you (What goes around, comes around
Oh it'd be a sad sad song
That hurts you, oh, so bad
Everybody comes around
Lemme hear you say woo (woo)
Secret secret I know the player
Can't believe my eyes
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow
Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
People keep talking
Couldn't leave me
This I know for certain You and me together
There's nothing else I can do And it's too bad cause love is blind
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else These lips are missin' you
That's not what I'm tryin' to be 'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
Celebrate and say, aye, aye, aye, aye aye (aye) I saw the world
I could be enough (I could be enough)
Shares a fraction of your smile
Yeah baby I'd die without you
Surely there's is a brighter day right in front of me (hold on)
I will never fall (I will never fall)
That you can trust is just
No
Let's get away
Darling
And that I had to leave (Now you) talkin' bout a family
Seems I had it all
I wanna make some much fire with you baby
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
I'm Singing This Love Is Unbreakable
Sólo como tú, baby
If I ain't got you with me baby I just want you close
Le damos a tus pies camino
We're Living Our Dreams
Hope my wings don't fail me now
My first teenage love affair
You don't have to cry (no more)
Foot on the pedal baby, it's time to find what you're made of
Who are you Who are you You look so familiar
And the streets are mean
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Now that you're gone
And a heavy load to bear
Betta pump the brakes and baby slow down
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
My love would over-rule my sense
Is too lonely without you, too lonely You know when it starts to get late
And I got 999 men knockin' on down my door
And god-sisters, who eventually slept with us
And the players have been chosen
Coming together
Oh
Oh, can nothing get in the way Through a shake of an earthquake
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears
No, said don't you leave me this way
And tempted to touch you
Through it all Don't think about the past, don't worry bout the future
Oh baby I need you
Got them wolves on me, no watch me like em clean
Turned a thrill
Oh oh Look around, look around at how lucky we are
No one has to know what you are feeling
Pray to Him
I believe love could bring us closer than blood I remember having four step-moms at nine
I'm gonna be here
(Now you) sayin' I'm your everything
That's what they say
Just to rub it in
To walk out my door
No more time left to be here
Just like you, just like you
Come on, come on yeah
You can have, or you can have not
If you do the right thing, we can be together
I will never fall
Oh yes
We should do it right now
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
But this is bigger than triumph
It happened on a Thursday
Oh oh oh oh It's too bad cause love is blind
I got this
So many reasons to sing this
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
And I, I will make sure that it lasts
All I can do is, follow the tracks of my tears
Just a moment is all it takes
Collabo Let's talk about the situation
Here the man come with the anthem, hands up
Like the night to the day
But they don't know
Giving solace to the one
A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin'
But they can't say good night
Walking down the sideway
To find something like what we have
Hear it from New York, New York, New York! One hand in the air for the big city,
Through The Technical Difficulties (Unbreakable)
Can get in the way of what Im feeling
Who wants to love somebody like me?
I found me, I found me, yeah I don't need your opinion
If I ain't got you with me baby Everywhere I'm turning
I'm waiting for your love
I'm a Superwoman Oh ooh Baby, baby, baby
Oh, cause we are heaven bound
I wanna tell you just how I feel
Woah, woah
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now
Cause the lights are on outside
Let me take you to another place
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
I I I I'm gonna love you gonna never let you fall
It feels so good And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
Oh, won't you be somebody's angel right now And the day came
Its just you and me
And its time to go to sleep, I
I'll be waiting No matter how far you are
What I should play
My soul has returned
I'll give you all my goods
Yeah, we can heal each other and fill each other
I'm a Superwoman For all the mothers fighting
I start fallin' back in love with you I keep on fallin'
I'm here for you
I'm gonna give you this letter
You seem now the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Now who's cryin, desirin' to come back I remember when I was sittin' home alone
It's too bad it don't matter baby for loving you
New York, New York, New York
Since you're gone Now I see myself through different eyes
At least I got to love you, tell 'em baby If I do nothing else, oh
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet
If I do nothing else, oh
What you do for love, love That's just what you do (for love)
No no no (baby baby baby)
And all my sisters
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
'Cause there is nothing those bars can do I will be the rising moon after setting sun
Don't know where I'm going
Only joy comes from song She's so rare and beautiful to others
You mean more than anything
Let's take it there Take it back in time
Every time I think, I'm getting closer
If I ain't got you with me baby Oooh oooh, New York (x2) Grew up in a town,
May keep me warm at night
But now I've had a change of heart, whoa... Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more
From afar, seems I had it all
That's what I'm telling myself (over and over)
Just to let you know that you'll always have someone
You bout' to miss a good thing
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late Just lean on my shoulder,
Where do we go from here?
Or 'cause others infiltrated?
The way that I love you What? Even if you were a million miles away
And I still remember everything you said (umm)
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Another way to die Another tricky little gun
Hey It's too bad cause love is blind
Time precious, I ain't have rest since nine eleven I live fast, hustle like today is my last
Listenin' to you will leave me lonely
Ain't perfect
Can you send an angel? 'Cause I don't wanna feel
I'll be here forever Ayo mo bee
But it doesn't mean anything
I wanted to touch me
What goes up, must come down)
If you wanna be with me, oh Say you love me, say you love me
I stand up and I'm searching
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And you're ready for whatever
(Now you) want to make time for me
It's too bad its so bad
(I won't deceive you, no)
A veces me siento perdido
Like a moth to a flame
AK: Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother in the nick of time
This blended family but baby
Please (oh oh)
It's a matter of extreme importance
It feels like
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
World is gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
Oh oh oh, hey
Oh Yeah Yeah... Yeah, Clap Your Hands Everybody
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
So many possibilities
So how could you, look me in my eye
That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me
I'm at your door
Back to life I'm not made to be locked up
Eh eh
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone (hey)
It may be wrong but baby I'm your fool
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Oh, oh, A-K!
And I won't deceive you
If you ask me I'm ready I know you said to me
To make it just like what we dreamed
I need you right by my side Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons The P's breathe Warriorz and skullies and Timmies
Don't you feel so good?
If I ain't got you Some people want it all
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you
But we rich now so dem caan tell man notin
And no needs,
A door left open
If you have something to say
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around?
I bet you wonder how I go on Ill simply say its on again, its on again
My love will only get stronger and stronger Cause I I I I I'm gonna love you gonna hold ya through it all
With the fire we make
New York City, baby It's like a jungle, out here
From the good man that he is Well, how do I let go when I've
How come you don't call me (why must you torture me)
spread her wings
But don't think we wastin' our time
