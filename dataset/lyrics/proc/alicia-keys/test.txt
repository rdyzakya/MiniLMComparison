I wanna go, gonna go to you darling, ah
And it'll probably sound something like this Say now baby girl you're better off
We were just passing the time
I feel so crazy about it
Hmm, yeah yeah yeah Devotion is my name
Through my smile I cry They don't know what they're doing to me
If I can touch the sky
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
I'm so thankful that I found
Celebrate and say Celebrate and say
Sacrificed
Can take a minute
Now a we a lock the city and, that is well known
Don't let go of me (hold on)
Sorta like me baby
don't care if you don't call me no more) 'Cause I'm the juiciest, baby (Juicy), girl around
You know you may think
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Ooh it set my soul on fire Ooh baby, baby, baby
This is the element of freedom I'll make the darkness light before you,
If you really need me, baby better come and say Say you love me, say you love me
Really, really wanted to catch your eye
Away from my man and me
Back to life Right now I feel like a bird
Yes she is
I just speechless baby, the poet in me has gone away, yeah, yeah Hey yeah, in the mornings when I rise up
It's too bad 'cause love is blind Eh eh
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something, won't wait till it's too late (I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait)
(Unbreakable)
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
And even though I married your father
I don't know
I sacrificed the things I want
An make him licke bredda dem kick up Jerome (hey I remember)
Rather be a poor woman living on the street
Touch me like this is the last time
Don't let them get in your way
You you
around (And you know that's right)
I'd be known to you too long
'Cause there's nothing that could fill that space
Just hanging out is fine
Ooh You don't know my name
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone
An mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome
Why not just set her free
I will never go away I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
Hold me like this is the last time
All those days that you stayed at my house
Look around, look around
Life becomes a way
Cause I know I don't want nobody else 'Cause these lips are missin' you (Missin' you)
It's time the thrill is back New York, let's stand up New York, New York, New York
La música, que cuando llega
But Ya'll Know We'll Be Back Next Week
Just like what we dreaming, yeah Now here's some loving for you, my darling
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own (hey)
Ain't no words to describe the way that I'm feeling, yeah
Just like what we dreaming
Me re-playing memories in my head
And everybody here trying to get on top
That stands right
Just to let you know you will always have my hand
I know people will try try to divide something so real
That wreckless love Ooh baby, let's go Have that wreckless love
(Crazy world of mine) So I won't lie
Then text me on the cell phone (text me on my cell phone)
So bright, she can burn your eyes
If you were worth a while
Love me like you'll never see me again
AK: One with the golden gun poison in your fantasy
Used to think you were right, but you was wrong
Remember cryin' sayin' that will never be me
La música le da sentido
Fill up your life, let me see your hands up one time
Say mommy donÃ¢??t worry cause its just u and me
We came for quit, remember when I used to tell my girls like yo this dude thinks he's all eh, think he's so fly
Or even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything Is it my turn to take you by your hands?
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait) Just a simple conversation
Just by dedicating all my time
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Say you need me, say you need me
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah [Chorus] Said I'd be gone by five
Like the desert needs the rain
I'll get down on me knees hoping you please
If I could grant you peace of mind
Was it everything that you were looking for?
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
From afar
Staring at clouds like wow look at my love
Nothing seems complete
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth We got way too much in common
Third base
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
See, we could be enough
When you've never been here before?
How do you, how do you think know my every move
Cause no one knows
Clap Your Hands Everybody
I wanna give my all Baby just hold me
I'm feelin' like, oh
Oh baby I could be enough
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I was your woman
Never do that?
For anyone's attention
Where are you now? Know I never let you down
Never knew where this would lead, yeah
I'm singing
I hate you had to read it in the paper
Now we got the keys to the kingdom I remember those days when hell was my home
Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something before it all goes away
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome (I remember)
Everyday, I need you
Like The People On TV We Gotta Stay Tuned
Some people live just for the fame
Don't worry about it cause
I don't want to come down
What you do for love (That's just what you do)
They can say what they like
Oh, hey darling
Now a we a lock the city and, that is well known (hey)
'Cause I'm the juiciest, baby (Juiciest, baby), girl
Darling you'll see
Say you love me, say you love me
I didn't say all that I had to say
(We should do it right now) You give me a feeling that I never felt before
My imagination's running wild It feels like ooh
'Bout how you came with information
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out Sing, if you want me love and all my time
Even when you're far away, mm
Didn't need me
(Yes we can, I know we can, I know we can)
This could be enough
It's up to us New York it's our city
Baby Baby Weren't you the one that said
No no no, no no no, can't stay away (can't stay)
With the
All that talk, and boy you better walk it
And she's burning it down
I'd never, never, no, no, no stop loving you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you I know some people search the world
All the battles I will fight down for you,
(about to make up this flame)
Yeah
So maybe we should love somebody
I'd be wishing you were here
Treat you like a real woman should
We could have it all Tell me baby (baby)
I'm what you need
Cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
If I speak up when you're wrong
Ooh baby I'm saying Let's go back there
Like I'm just some kind of a fool
Guide me In the morning when you wake
Cause your stronger and you're better
Got your head in the clouds
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
So many ways, I'm in amazement Thinking about you, no one took the time
Sorta like you
Let's take it there
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say, "Aye aye oh" (oh) There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
To believe that he can do it better
What you do to me, your confusing me
If you don't know what the struggle's for
And He Ain't No Different From You
Then I realize
No no no
Mess around end up in a choke, hold
What you do for love
But all i know is everythings going to be alright No one, no one, no one
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
I will be the clearest day when the rain is done
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Ooh
I'd do wrong for you I can't take this loneliness you've given me
And you were my man, yeah She tears you down darling
That go together better
She's on top of the world
Won't you call me sometime, pappa Why don't you call me
I'm Singing This Love Is Unbreakable We're Living Our Dreams...Yeah...
Made me crazy
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
Behind you
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
So good that soon you'll be here
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
And I ain't nothing like I was before
Through the days and nights
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruke no
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
It's just the brand new kind of me It took a long long time to get here
No worries followed by fear
Cause tomorrow may not come
Tell me baby, what stops you from wearing a crown?
I wanna be somebody, be somebody
'Cause these arms ain't holdin' you (Holdin' you)
That I could talk to, this is the type of day
Speaks to my soul
Mi say Mikey We get di ting dem dem outta luck now
And all of my friends think I'm crazy, for loving you
I'll be waiting You are always on my mind
Oh, oh, A-K!
Kind of love
What I wanna know baby, if what we had was good
Some people want diamond rings
You will always be around
Back to life, mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh Climb out from the bottom baby
Girl, I think it's time for you to go
And I've been there before, and that life's a bore
(He's juicy)
Because your arms
And I can't be found
Oh oh oh oh Some people live for the fortune
The way that I love you Oh, baby
Eh eh eh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
'cause He Ain't No Different From You
And I give myself to you, oh
How come you don't call me
All this this and that, can you do better?
Look me in my eye
A man on your side
I passed that, this morning just so the world can see
Just like the time before
She's just a girl, and she's on fire I just want you close
What's up, Kandi?
I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda All at once
And it's alright (for love)
So baby, let's go Have that wreckless love
Is too lonely without you, too lonely So why don't we
I must really like you
If it ain't you baby
Where you decide to stay And I would be enough
When I wanna face today and all your heartache
Seeing my face in lights
When I wake up in the morning
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
And I can finally breathe
If I walk a little taller
Who snitchin', who told police
Come join this crazy world of mine
Tell me how could you
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto) And the night is takin' over
And shoutout to the step-sisters and step-brothers
Of all the things I can't say
Better look the other way
I think it's, my real my true love
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Yes yes yes
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded But that's a lonely road to travel
(Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah I cross the dryest desert
Can you pick up the phone
(I want you to promise me)
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
just let her fly, just let her fly
This bed
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me
Is too lonely without you (Baby, baby)
Oh, oh, oh,
Near me, touch me, feel me And even at the bottom of the sea
All night and all day
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
Don't go nowhere
keeping me from flying
Don't want to come down
Cause a we a mek Mama a nyaam Fish an Mutton, hey
Into a tragedy Yeah, a door left open
I had it all
'Cause baby I know you're worth it She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true
It's a new day, it's a new day"
'Cause peace and love ain't so far
I'll make it without you tonight So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra
So much struggle, out here
Me say Mikey It's been a while, I'm not who I was before
We Might Have To Take A Break
the whole world to see She's like a caged bird
All of my friends think I'm crazy but I don't care
Wait til they see your smile If war is holy and sex is obscene
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (hold you)
How come you don't call me There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
(Can you do that for me baby)
uh Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more
So baby, let's go Every little bit hurts
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
I remember when we run Fatta get him knee blown
All the places I've been
Sólo como tú, oh, my sister Todo el mundo va buscando ese lugar
And I got 999 men knockin' down on my door
Always thought you'll be by my side
Wait til they see your smile Don't they love to see you down
And give the keys back to your door
Gotta find the strength in me I am a Superwoman
Every single night
A lifelong legacy, me loving you and you loving me
Because she was first darling
Around mixed, spics, niggaz and giddies
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
Look around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you Oh oh oh oh
And if you have to walk a million miles
Far it would go
I keep dreamin' bout you
While the time it slips away
Go to the window and I smile with my eyes up
Send me gifts and showin' me the romance
I'd risk to fall just to know how it feels to fly (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah (Yeah) yeah
We can take flight like a thief in the night
In this crazy world of mine
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it's clear to see
Look what you made me do
And if I don't try, then what was I made for? Back to life
Cause I don't wanna hold my pillow
What you do for love I know it started with a little drama
Crying like oh oh
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
So til the end of time Im telling you there is no one No one, no one
No one but me and you I won't tell your secrets
I wanna burn a candle
I know I'm losing control
Make love tenderly to last, to last
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Take notice of what's in front of you 'Cause did I mention (oh)
We should give life to this beautiful dream
To say goodbye
The challenges you're facing
Hit my sisters just for dinner 'cause the cookin' was bomb
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
'Cause I'm the juiciest, baby, girl around (Baby)
Take every little piece of my soul (Piece of my soul)
Another dirty money
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
Some people live for the power, yeah
I'll never live without you I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
Dinner lit by candles
Everything's going to be alright
And tried to make you stay with me
You must be messed up too Lay your head on my pillow
It's you that I want All at once
Ova dehso mek mi tell unnu some'in,
[Incomprehensible] so bad, so bad right now
Can you feel me? (ay)
New York City, baby
Now, my heart is open
That's the way it's gonna be 'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
I won't let you drown
I can't be done
That just wont be fair
They don't know how I feel inside
You see I know nothing last forever Imagine there was no tomorrow
Where fear ends and faith begins Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
Every little bit hurts
Desert me Come back to me
You'll say I told you so
State of humanity
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
If you stay in this crazy world of mine
I just don't want to say goodbye
No no no (oh you can't)
When the place that you were born is not where you belong
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
New York City, baby Clap Your Hands Everybody
I was just a girl and you a young man
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb (i remember)
These arms are wantin' you
Everything's alright, alright That's what you do, what you do, what you do
Night after night, knowing somethin' goin' on
Still alive lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
