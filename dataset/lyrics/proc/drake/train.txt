Story up just to keep you
Yeah Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
'Cause that shit might come in handy
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
B**** I said I'm him so I'm nothin' like them
She spilled whisky on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
Baby, come closer Yeah, I get it
(Listen, look) (Nipsey Hussle Verse 2)
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
She said we do it rough tonight not smoothly
What have I learned since getting richer
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
Tonight I'll ease your mind
Someone to fuck me
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
On the boulevard
(Hold on) [Drake - Chorus]
And then it's too much
Oh, you niggas got jokes
That thang keep calling
And getting high with you
Lot of you niggas that copy
I know exactly who you could be Oh just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga
Life can always change, you have to adjust
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like Do you love this shit?
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I treat V Live like it's '07 in Magic City
You know I stay remniscin'
So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Intro]
they're just some jibber jabber
I did another one, I did another one
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup! How did I end up right here with you
Fuck it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill em'
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here I done kept it real from the jump
I see that money just piling
Kick game, run game, run it real good
And I seen a lot of you die [Hook]
When I needed you you couldn't give me any advice
Throne is back up in it, aye
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
I know you feel what I feel
So girl, what you singing for?
But man that's not a swap to me
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
I come alive in the night time
I got, mind control over Deebo
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga Yeah
And show me pictures of they friends
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
She rode that dick like a soldier
But you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
Let her suck my pistol
You keep me calling on you How you mean, how you mean
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Tell Gelo, bring the juice
Almost drowned in her p**** so I swam to her butt
They might catch me slippin'
Oooooohhh [Chorus] Ive been so dependent on your love for so long,
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
I don't trust a word you say
Baby, wanna make you say road
I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed
Yeah, no tellin'
Binnin' out we keep the cash on deck
All I know if I die I'm a motherfuckin' legend
They ain't rooting for me, they ain't clapping for me
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
Whats my name, whats my name Nor everybody,
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
Let me go, let me bring it home
And things will probably never change
So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook] I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
And my new car is Rufio
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
I had to get back to you, whoa
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had Uh, ah yeah
I ain't even see my friends that year
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
(Perfect) Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
I think we gettin' too deep
Now she clean the house
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
Well I got it, I got it
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these b****es wanna chill
Whats my name, whats my name Baby you got me,
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Cash money young money pop champagne
My niggas really need the whole thing yeah yeah Blowin' up
Never see me out
One more time 'fore I go
From the six to the fucking 876 Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now Say to you
You ain't on it right away, you had to wait on niggas
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin', with like, some pimpin' to it, or something? That you can relax, pop a top to, or something? [Verse 1]
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
Heard they had the club wild, it was star studded
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble [Kendrick Lamar]
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Them boys just not bluffing them boys just not bluffing
Turn you to a vegetable like you living in soup
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something (woo!)
Ya don know, aye?
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city you
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
Please don not speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
(oh yeah, oh yeah) Show me a good time
Plottin', schemin', getting money This the life for me
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
You're pretty in the clothes but mi love when you nude
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches
6 cold like Alaska
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
That we almost had
I see it's piling and piling and piling
Listening to the
I do not chase girls
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Baby you're a challenge
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
Where you at? I never see you [Hook]
So mi would love it if you could come thru
They can't live this long
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me "You're not going to come?"
Hey its all I can do is
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Dedicate, I dedicate the world
You told me about the picture
And now my face bring the cameras out
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
we gon' knock you off
Just let me go, let me bring it home
Gotta get a handle on you
Strength and guidance
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Loving you no more,
So let's just get it out the way
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
I'm just gonna' have another drink
That's why me and lil' jazz bout to spazz
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
I go for mine like it's overtime
And you're wasted with your ladies
Cover me I'm goin' in and I ain't f***in' with no hood cops I'm goin' in
Started a label, the album is comin'
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow" Cash rules everything around me
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
Free smoke, free smoke [Outro]
And now you hate me
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
But I live a double life and need to let her go
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Overtime and out of town
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
I come out the gutter, I really made it
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
That's why I'm calling on you
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
Take a shot for me
I've always liked my women book and street smart
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Mama never used to cook much
Fuck all your feelin's
I'm way too good to you
but they run a mile for me
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
Ain't got fuckin' time

Blowin' up, yeah
Big dick bandit

Ass is off the hook
Neets got the weed, hush got a gun
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
I dedicate, baby, dedicate
Refuse to be forgotten
So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Verse 1]
Me say mi want her all my life
We poppin' like champagne bottles but we never shook
Want you to know how it went
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter they hurting
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
And get what you been missing I better find your lovin'
That's my MO add a B to that s***
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
Thought you knew about the team, (ay) How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
Niggas be droppin' subliminals nigga
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
On the corner flippin' hard
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
You got something to say, then say that thing
That's just something they know They know, they know, they know
Can't just leave it off that way... [Hook]
But it's far from over Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on him
D&G;, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe
Oh man, oh man
Real ting eh Yeah
I'm doin me
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out with me, no paparazzi
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin'
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
Girl I'm sleepy
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Do you ever get nervous?
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
There's no code or ethics out here
You just like my psychic, I just wanna buy
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Know I used to be around more
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
21 savage A.K.A. The Reaper huh
I just gotta know the road Something is said, don't say that again
Oh yeah You know what I'm like, oh yes, oh yeah
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
My life aint the same as you are,
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Got a reputation for yourself now
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You cannot be here right next to me
They would do it just like I do if they could
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear You know how they say
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
I can not be gotten, that's a given
But seeing my family have it all
Vibe switch like night and day
You're the only one I trust with it
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
M-3 beamer (check)
Tonight, right now?
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
"Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then" Just throw up while I hold your hair back
And I'm on the road box office sales, I'm getting paid for all of this shit
You can't put it out once we light it,
Parmesan my panino
That the real is on the rise
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
Wonder if they second guessin' their decisions
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed
It's no different over on this side
Thinking my songs are about them
Hundred cousins out in Memphis they so country, wow
Don't make me kill one of the GOAT's for it
And now your past is behind you
Started from the bottom now we're here
then fill it with red forever-ever
Kickin' bitches out the Condo like Pam

When he told me pay it no mind
I won't ease your strength Drake:

Top down, right here is where she wanna be
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show And we started from the bottom now we're here

Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Like one, three, yeah [Pre-Hook]
Nails done hairs done, everything big And my N-Y girls let me see your hands
My last name was my lifestyle
How many girls have slept in this bed
I got a bitch located in every city
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
Is basically the reason I became something different
My P.O. Think I'm in the house
Man, I got a blunt, can I get a light?
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
What more can I say now?
That's the wrong thing to do
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
I got a really big team I got a really big team
You keep me calling on you How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)
I get guala on guala
There's more to life than sleeping in
I'm a mufuckin
You know how that shit go Don't fuck with them niggas they too irrational woah
Fuckin' right, all right So much for being optimistic
Them boys up to something Whoa
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
I need a shawty from Houston
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
A bunch of girls going wild when your chain flooded
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
This is more than just a new lust for you Done saying, I'm done playing
Really you never was solid
Word to New York
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Makin' juugs on the highway
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
I fell in love with the Rollie
Streets not safe
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
Back up, back up and
I had to bust up the silence
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
It's only me and her because the Bugatti a coupe
Then I'm a motherf***in' spend it
That I'ma call her anyway and say Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to, yeah

But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
Nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah
You and me, only

Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
Shit wine or water
So you should go
Go, go, go, go,
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Why has every woman never dined here before?
But it's far from over
But that was years later on some crazy shit
Killa
You and all your girls in the club one time
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team if she's at the game Right, right, yep
I could not give you the recipe
How much it hit me fo'? Ain't no tellin', yeah
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
Don't make me give you back I say bounce that shit like woah
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
Looking for some things and I think I can find it in you, in you Oh ooooh, trust issues
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
I think them percocets had me in my feelings
Who you with? What you claim?
If you come here trying to take some there's a lot more where that came from
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
I ain't even gotta call no one for it Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog
Don't wanna take it slow Got the club goin' up
I brought the game to its knees
I'm too good with these words
I play my part too, like a sequel
(Drake: but always end up preventing me from achieving them)
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
So they can talk about they timeline
I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
It's gonna take some getting used to
Come take a look, get a load of dis nigga
I'm somebody that you should know
And she make it clap when she ride my bike
Oh, they loving the crew
Some one tell Meliah I'm on fire,
But bitch I got money to blow
One day said I would do it
But it's cool, know you heard it all before That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
I just build and build more
Everything I said, it happened
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
This song's for you Yeah, yeah Dropped outta school now we dumb rich, dumb rich
And you seen all my mistakes
That don't love you back
Baby 'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
Very important and very pretentious
You just lead the way
She insists she got more class, we know!
That has been disconnected or is no longer in service Yeah I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
But it's far from over One thing 'bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, lifestyle Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
On your face girl, it just don't show
I ain't got no time
Drizzy (Drake chorus)
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
Leavin' girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
Would've came back for you
No lie I'm higher than I ever been
No brake pads no such thing as last, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I've loved and I've lost It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Then we release the stress and ya feel renewed Sexiness you a pro
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it Take a shot for me, ooh
Are you single?
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
They don't need to know all of our business
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
The woman that I would try
You tryin' forget about
I've been in this club too long
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
That I'ma call her anyway and say
I swear you got me losing my mind Ooh na na, what's my name
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit, one shit
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
I'm blowing up like I'm urgent
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I done did everything to her
This game is different, you only get one shot when niggas gon' foul on you
Countin' money you know how it goes
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
And more chune for your headtop
After all the things that I been through
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
Pluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same [Hook]
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
I gave your nickname to someone else
On drinkin', lets all get faded
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Ain't no tellin' Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Candy paint foreign lights with my bitch in
And you see what I'm bout
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
Felt like the initiation
I can't fuck with you no more 'cause you be actin' extra
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uh
Uh
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
My mama told me this was right for me
Devil in a tight dress
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Ovofbg 60 Naked bitches, no exaggeration
Go, go, go,
The reason was the highlight was when he said
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border
And I keep the check Nike concord Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Remember when you had to take the Bar exam, I drove in the snow for you? Yeah you probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
You don't even fucking link nobody no more,

Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug

Never chase it, let it come to you
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
And enough money to loan us, a little something extra
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends

Man these niggas is scared, they tellin'-tellin'
My vice is similar women love when your my type
And ain't nobody realer, go, go, go, go, go
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Man you boys just got to Hollywood
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit
Thinking I'd die for you
Cause if we judging off your advances, I just got paid like eight advances
Last time was on the outro
Niggas moves so waste
Then again maybe she will
Shit ain't been the same like before
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw Ovo, Unruly
We 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Shout out to the G's from the ends
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care

Talk stupid, off with your head!
Codeine sippin, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know

I don't claim colors
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Face Time with my shawty on tour

Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,

Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me

Don't come around and try to gas me up I like runnin' on E
Flights in the morning

Tension between us just like picket fences

Boy I'm on that fly shit
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
'Cause we're fallin' apart [Chorus]
Are you down for the cause?
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye

And she texting purple hearts 'cause she know we at war Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Mutombo with the bitches, you keep getting rejected (woo!) Heard they came through magic city on a Monday
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Im going through hell to convince you love me,
And when I find it, is when I find you
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
You and me we just don't get along
They look up to me
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
I love the way you put it together, ugh Oh you fancy huh?
Lets pull the two seater out baby
We in Miami living la vida loca, ayy
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
Way past the point of turning me on
How long did we last?
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
They don't love you like they used to man [Woman on phone]
These things'll fall down
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
You took the time to figure me out

She give me tease and she pleasing my roja
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Ooh na na, what's my name
I keep buyin' shit just make sure you keep track of it all
Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now But the good ones go
Shifts every other weekend
Listen you can hear them calling my name
I give Chanel out like a hug I know
You got a lot on your plate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I was aggressive, and she was sober
But I'm one year older than my little homie
I don't know, I'm delirious night" [Drake - Verse 1]
Yeah, they want it back to back
You can call it statutory,
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Just think I'm where it all beginning
As Shady spits his flow,
Hidden hills where I post, yeah
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You used to call me on my cell phone
Im ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Just hold on we're going home, ho oh I got my eyes on you,
And you still got underwear thats sittin in the dryer
You may not hear from them ever again
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one they never get confused wit 'Cause baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Women I like was ignorin' me
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in the moment
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Now me and Chef, KD
Someone else girl
That would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 2]
I'm on a Mo City trip
I do it how you say you want it
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
Started drinking way more than I used to
You never believe me
My city love me like a college running back
You bout to break me,
All it took was patience
I say, "fuck that nigga that you think you found
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
So don't play with my money this summer I'm serious
I drunk text J-Lo
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
More life You know a lot of girls be
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
What am I willin' to give her
They don't love you like they used to man Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Whole time they wanna take my place
That looked just like a Bentley I
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
And you know Runnin' through the 6 with my
Young money, yeah yeah
I've loved and I've lost I've asked about you and they've told me things
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Maybe we should have just did things my way
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night' Cups of the Rose
I'll buy the tires for you
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
You ain't got the juice like that"
And there's things you gotta go through
Yeah
Go go go 'head
Ya, ya up and away
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
You should see someone about a cold drink
If I die, I'm a legend
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time tho
I said I'm sorry girl
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
I wake up pray every morning
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Breaking you off, it's so real
We can work it out
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
I'm goin' in! I'm goin' in
Franchise tag on me Bron Bron
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
Yeah, me
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
You know I gotta' go
I'm with you Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
I need some company
Like everyone I know And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
I dedicate Throwin' dirt on my old name
Oh oh oh ooh I got oh oh
Baby I like your style [Verse 1: Drake]
They gottao die out eventually
You don't need nobody else, no
Even when I'm away
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Like the rappers I know
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
One hundred I am on a twenty four hour
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider
I am, what everybody in my past don't want me to be
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
I told her I'd admit it
I don't deserve it
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you And last night I think I lost my patience
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
Who really think they can get in the way
I fell in love as a dodie
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They don't wanna see me
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine Your so predictable I hate people like you
I ain't looking back no more, no, no, no
And I'm with two women make you take a second look
You're such a fucking loser,
Now it's something they know
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
I'm doin' my stance
Pray the real live forever man
The good ones go, if you wait too long
And I can't blame 'em
But ahhhhh, you see the same one Im missing
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
I know when that hotline bling
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
And we goin be alright if we put drake on every hook They can't help it,
This the shit I wanna go out to You're my right hand, you're my go to
And pray for the best
I just caught that tempo, DJ Mustard (woo!)
If I die, I'm a legend I'm the one I'm more than just an option
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
You make me sing high notes
We shouldn't be together
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
You ain't gonna have no face to save
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
Sometimes I'm so indecisive But you a real ass woman and I like it
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
SO IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU HANG WITH HOES Drake:
To make sure the money was right
Yeah, me and all my
I know you want to go to Maui
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
(Killa)
We need some really nice things
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
Jump when I say jump, girl can you take direction? (Ooh!)
Are you high right now?
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Me I'm just done, done, done, done I don't take this shit for granted
Get down, have her lay down
Automatic weapons on the flo' but who can you call
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
How come every time that youre suspicious Im a liar?
To party on the weekend
I told my story, it made history
Fill the room up with some tings
Almost gave up on the music thing
She ain't ready for it
Overdosed on confidence
If I ever loved you I'll always love you that's how I was raised
But we still met, later that night
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
We about to get lit
Way too much codeine and Adderall
Stop pretendin', stop that frontin'
I got a really big team Man what a time Got everything, I got everything
Someone that's so proud to be with me
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
Yeah you thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl, how 'bout now?

Til I do my thing hop up out it like biem,

Before I'm on the next thing, YMCMB (ah) Ooh finally got you right here
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up Zoe
Plus you know you're not yourself anymore
You judged me before you met me yeah it figures
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
I know you're trying to help me
Shit is crazy back home
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97 whoa

Only on camera, only on camera
They know, they know, they know, Breaking news my niggas
And you don't even have to ask twice,
Damn. Tell me what Im gone do
(oh yeah, oh yeah) How 'bout you and all your morals and that outfit that you borrowed
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
She rode it like a real marine soldier Thank you, thanks Drake, thanks baby
Oh you fancy (fancy) Oh man
I'll take care of you
Running out of pages in your passport
We doing 300 records a day
When I slap the taste out your mouth
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Still, you were lonely
International Hov, that's my handle
150 inch screen in my bedroom
I be over there, shawty I be over there
Take a shot for me, ooh
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that All of my let's just be friends
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
You hear but you don't listen
This is not to get confused
Oh you fancy huh? Nail done, hair done, everything big
I've been drinking so much
Whats happenin'?
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
And I'm only getting older somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
I take somebody elses car, drive it undercover
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
Don't make me give you back to the hood
But you'll pick 'em up
Ooh, ooh What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
Just look at what I done alone
Same nigga that you knew way back when
Some company I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
I mean maybe she won't
Swear I just had an epiphany
Whoa
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
Forgiveness for your ways
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
Guess it wasn't time
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas,
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
And why you gotta say the last word
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
Your body language says it all
I can almost guarantee she know the deal
Why you had to do him like that?
I got money to blow
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (yup)
And I had em like wow, cup dirty
And when I visualize success
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the wi-fi
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Call me on my cell phone
And drake just stand for "Do Right And Kill Everything"
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne! Yeah, run up I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
And look I really think that nobody does it better
Go uptown, New York City b****
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
Wish a n**** would like a tree in this b****
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
M.I.A. in the MIA
Cause yo verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Same way I'm right here still feeling a way
You are waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
And since you picked up I know he's not around oh
For the things that I won't regret
I can see it, like, right away
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
I'm gettin' it in, letting these bills fall
Just let me go
And I'm motherf***in' in it
Nails done hair done, everything big And my L-A girls, let me see your hands
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds tho
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wife-in niggas
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
500 million, I got a pound cake
We don't love no girls from the ends
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
But you get real on a pill and I like it
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both the Bentleys
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I'm just gon' have another drink
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
Whole squad on that real shit The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
I doubt you'll find another
It's wherever you wanna go Bobbin' to the music
I jus' want you to see
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
You know when I'm mixin'
A shot for me
Buncha' out of season woman
Every time you see I look like I hit the lotto twice
I tongue kiss her other tongue
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Cause myself just told myself, "You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
And that's why I need a one dance
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
Go go go go go go 'head
Redemption's on your mind when you (Think about me)
Ahhh, That's how you feel man?
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
Did he open doors for ya?
Just make sure they that special somebody
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, cause I know
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
No looking back when I'm gone
Oh you thought you had it all figured back then girl, how 'bout now
(yeah)
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
You won't never get to run me
My nigga Jibba he whip it I ride in the passenger
I keep tissue paper
If I die, I'm a legend I'm the one, one
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Coke
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'm gonna need it back
Can't just leave it off that way, nah [Verse 2]
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
They never told me when you get the crown
Despite the things you said to me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
They need some really big rings
I've always been me I guess I know myself
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
They just discuss it in private
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart I bet if I give all my love
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart It's more than just a mission
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I just hit the beat and float
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
You need better seatin'
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I've been long gone
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
Say she gon' ride for me
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
But what am I to do when her parents do not try, So many tears I cried,
I'mma have b's when I'm 70
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
That I'ma call you anyway and say Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
And they never will Ok I know you want the Audi
It's like they can't get enough
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
She rode it like a real marine soldier
I'm the Osirus of the shit right now
No need for a room
And she texting purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Look at the smile on me
I can tell ya bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
You know it, oh ho, you know it
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
We gotta take time with this
But boy you stay up on it
Quit frontin' on me
I've been so quiet, I got the world like
I'll look back on this and think
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
After this drop I got new demands
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Yeah, I said I'm on one
"Well I'm sorry" [Drake]
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
"Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
We just know shit gettin' run through
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
(there probably end up being another argument candy girl,
So I got 'em for you
I better find your lovin'
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
Hit me to tell me you get off at 10
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Bentley Spurs and Phantoms Jordan Fadeaway Yeah
So every single summer
How we had the club going up On a Tuesday
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
I'm like b**** me neither
I don't run out of material
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
So I surrender, to every word you whisper
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
I just turn colder every time I try
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Hat to da rizzle
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
And to them hoes I'm everything, everything but gentle
Smokin' on the low
I can't fake that, babe
You're moving too fast
And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
That money triple up when you get it out of state
And just that I remember me before
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
We ain't even have a tour bus
Guess it's what they say you need family for
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Isn't exactly what god had planned
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
Where, where, where
Downtown with a girl like me
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin', man?
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Fuck it, I'm on one
These demons, they callin' my soul
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
Got a Hennessy in my hand
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Is it the strength of your feelings
And if I tell you how I really felt
Just me and my baby
I sit back and laugh 'cause these niggas traitors
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
You might feel like nothin' was the same I still been drinkin' on the low
Work somethin', twirk something basis
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
Ain't no tellin' Rock me real slowly
Oh, you just went and turned your back dog
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
Pushing me away so I give her space
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
Ok now we got some action
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
And I don't want you to see no one else
Baby I like your style [Verse 2: Drake]
He give me the dozen, I know that they're mighty
Yeah you know word of mouth
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
'Specially when you never come through
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
I think I'd die for you
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face [Verse 1]
I still love it but I used to love it more
I wanna see my niggas go insane
Blowin' up
And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Line blowin' up
All that never comin' home shit [Hook]
When you gettin' a lot of money you can't ever save it But tonight, me and my friends we got money to spend
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
Voicemail say she ready though
Look at the business mergers
What would I do without you, my chargi?
I need a girl who gon' love me
Live the ambiance all cause the audiance
She should work tonight
Yeah, girl how 'bout now
Spending all the money I just work my ass off
I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
Been have up di ting dem from time, G.
We just want the credit where it's due
One night off and this is it
I'm livin' life right now, mayne And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Goofy flow on records I'm Captain Hook
They used to always come check for me
And my table got so many plates on it
Drizzy back up in this thang, I'm ready
Being indecisive makes me anxious
I pray, I pray [Hook: Drake]
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
Ho oh (goin' home) You're the girl
Aston Martin music, music
You couldn't buy the real thing
They turn they back and they leave you
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
And I think I text her and told her I made it
I need someone different
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
We've got no time [Hook: Drake]
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
You gon' make me call my bros, for assistance
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
So I don't know what's wrong with these lil waste mans out here eh,
In our ride "Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
I love Nicki Minaj
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
Do things when you want me too
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
I'm goin' in (I'm goin' in)
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Yeah, and fuck, you left the boy no options
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
Last night, I came to a realization
Lipstick 'n concealer
I got the loudest of the loud
Its blood gang slime but I party with Snoop
I'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas
You know who you are, I got you It may not mean nothing to y'all,
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you? (And I say) Hell yeah
Since, things never been the same [Pre-Hook]
Go slower, go faster
I been Steph Curry with the shot
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)
You're still here to touch the ground
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Ghost-writin' rumors turn you to a ghost?
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Make me call my bro I don't need love I'm the GOAT
And even when its business with you it's personal again
I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
Since everything Im trying to forget is all true
'Cause if I don't share the wealth, then how the fuck we supposed to grow
You got somebody other than me
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
'Cause we're fallin' apart
But I never run away
And makeup sex is tradition
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
You got something that belongs to me
We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty
Boi-1da, what's poppin'? Yeah, yeah
I don't wanna fight it Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a goal
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
Instead of the other way I tried with you
Oh you switchin' sides?
What's the word these days?
Now I'm in the East 'cause my boys are gettin' right, man
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse
You still down? You still down? You still down? Rock me real slowly
And you just tell me what you down for
And bury yourself alive, then I died
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
It look like we in love, but only on camera
My diamonds is pissing, my swag is exquisite
Can't just leave it off that way
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace King of Versace, Medusa my wifey
Knows how to make me want it
It's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
(Look)
You da best I ever had,
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
That's my team, never would I let a woman come between
We don't take it in, we just change locations I said, tell me, whats really goin' on
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
Coming live from the the muthaf-cking north side
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
Passin' up on my old ways
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all That's that shit that drives me crazy
You won't ever have to hide
That's cuttin' all into my time with you Rock me real slowly
They say love is in the air, so I
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man Blowin' up
I practice good over evil
Okay, away we go
Real nigga talking
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Make you lose control
Then you find it, awkward silence
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Damn right, all right
They know, they know, they know, Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
Real n**** wassup? Wassap, wassap Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I like that money is money is piling
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before You used to call me on my cell phone
Silk pajamas when I wake, though
I don't think that I should dance
Call me over-rated or created or too jaded
You dealin' with a few true villains
Since I got famous
I see em tweaking they know something coming (woo!)
Oh yes, Oh yeah
I've been ridin' out of state
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
So you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
This is how we do it, all night (all night)
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
Like the car with the strap in it
I took a chance with my heart
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
Bitches, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
I saw people doin' things
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Show me a good time
I know the question rhetorical
You know the game even got it like that
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Miraval to the face, though
You know you know [Drake - Verse 1]
Man, nobody's never done it like I did it (Ugh) I know way too many people here right now
F-ck it I'm on one
Damn, is it the fall
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, "Nah, fuck that shit
Jealousy, envy and greed
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
And spit true feelings,
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen
Yeah you really wanna hold us down
That's been where you find me at
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
'Cause you just my type Ooh na na na na
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
I know, I know [Outro: Drake]
Aston Martin music, music Would've came back for you
I bought some ice when the feds came
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
Don't ask no shit when it come to my set
If you can go downtown with a girl like me
Tryna satisfy everybody
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
If you can't hold your liquor you better quit right now How did I end up right here with you
And I'm never on a waste ting shawty
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't,
Yeah nigga I'm about my business,
Aston Martin music, music Uh,
So your the only one Cause I don't trust these bitches
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
B****, I'm goin' in (jizzle)
I know what we want
Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold
Really when she get to talking I don't understand it
I'm tired of all of these niggas
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
You know I could be your knight in shining Armour All tires
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now
Instead they say [Intro: Nai Palm]
Something's been missing
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
On my way, money taught me Spanish
Yo, you cheesed me dog." Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
She actin' like she not but she know she f***in' with it
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
Yea you know I'm f***in' in it
You know what it is when I finally make it home
No, you can't "son" me
Lamborghini's and the Bentleys on the V-set
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Yeah, you know wassup, ay
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl
Me and Gibbo was about that
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
All of my guys know me all about me paper
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
Come to V-I-P and get a Champagne Shower
But all for nothing Im afraid to say,
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks, there
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
Passionate from miles away
Who fuck for balls or reason or bowls of baked ziti Oh you fancy huh?
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
I'm back in my bag
I fuck a chick up every day
I, I just had to buy another safe
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
And I hope you can take it
First name greatest,
My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
I'm bout my paper like a mu'fuckiin' scratch n' win
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
Lobster and celine for all my babies that I miss
I just don't understand it
Like controlla, controlla
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
When I come around these rappers niggas start to panic
And I say (And I say) Hell yeah
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
Mail comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
Make me call my bros for assistance
Then its adiios
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
Is you single or what?
You out here tellin' everybody everything
Thing I love
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
I bet if I give all my love
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
We take a Mellow Yellow
It might look like I care, but only on camera
I flew jet, she flew commercial
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl [Bridge: Kyla + Wizkid]
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
And she was acting like a virgin
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Won't you sing mi note pon the cordless mic?
"You're not going to come?"
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
This our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
You don't see anybody else
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Dopeman dopeman dopeman dopeman dopeman dopeman
Better late than never,
Oh you fancy huh?
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Yeah I swear to god that I'm gone
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Places that I should've been
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
Why you never alone
You got issues that I won't mention for now
And I'm a go hard (and I'm a go hard) It goes hold up wait one motherf***in' minute
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
Or better yet, wait on me [Hook]
And since you picked up I know he's not around" (Are you drunk right now?) I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
Demons, they callin' my soul
They 'ont know who we are
You're everything that I see
I've been workin' graveyard
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Yeah, like controlla, controlla She love when we do it all night
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
I'll be the one that you remember I better find your lovin'
We just count up paper racks, woooah
And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing
I can't help it
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
She asked
I'm doin' me
Too many drinks have been given to me
They need some really nice things
And if I brought it in the club
Niggas like "you took the summer off? We couldn't tell"
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl, oh
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
I see all of her friends here
'Til it's over
And you know how that shit go
I just been out and bad from way back when
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom
They always dying to mention me
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
And to top it all
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
If you love somebody
We talk casualy about the industry
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
Put this music shit aside, gettin' it in on the road
I don't think I'm conscious of making monsters
And in my pocket
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
I could GPS you if you need some addressing
Just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
That was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Never front, you take it there, ain't no coming back
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Girl you a killer and ain't nobody realer
Back up, back up and [Hook: Drake]
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Nail done, hair done, every thing did
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Yeah you really wanna hold us All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy
And I'm a go hard (go) First off
Fully loaded automatic six Benz
Weezy had all the authority
So much hate inside your heart
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird, hit the Gucci store
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
How 'bout now girl, what 'bout now girl, how 'bout now Yeah always been daddy's little angel
So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook]

Used to work, used to dance in Texas
Let 'em know everything big
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change I wake up on a daily basis
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum, they do
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
they thought I died
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Oh yeah
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year, guess
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
You see that '62 sittin outside? That's me there
In our ride
Born hustlin' too big nigga to size me up
Lets explore your talent Hey boy I wanna see
You know that I'm living
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend 2 In the morning my mind is on you
And I don't mean to say the most
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
They was like "hold up wait a minute" I was like "nah nigga let's get it"
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Go 'head
"What the fuck is he planning?"
Higher powers taking a hold on me
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all After hours of Il Mulino
I feel like Juelz Santana
Promethazine over Pinot
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me

My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
Time for me to revisit the past

That's why I keep telling you over and over again
I don't want you here with someone else
Just when shit look out of reach

And in my pocket Lickwood means rewind, a gunshot means forward
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
'Cause anything's possible, yeah

She's just a little too worth it
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
One do it then we all gotta do it
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on

Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine, in the same league, but we don't ball the same
I'm lookin' for paper in any city

Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
But never late is better
Your bod' like action movie
Dedicate to you

You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun

Reps Up, you know there a hundred of them
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift

I came out of trenches, I really made it
The way you walk, that's me
Switchin' up the angles
And the voice in your ear, that's me
And we never talk too much after I blew up
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices outta my pie
Upstairs I got xan's in a Advil
I miss the feeling of you missing me
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go
I'm leaving, I'm gone
Changing your opinion on me
With my
I need someone to put this weight on "Well I'm sorry"
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
They shoulda never let you 'round cake

Mad cause he ain't like me
Money that we got, never get that shit Cause I'm on one

I hear everybody talkin' bout what they gonna be
I ain't trippin' let 'em rest in peace I been on a mission haven't left the condo
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
I need a girl from Kentucky
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
"Drake you got em right?"
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
No more no (no more no)
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
And you turn me on like a new Bugatti
That's why I never ask for help
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
So shes right here gettin' naked
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Wake up and pray every morning
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
Ain't s*** sweet n****s on the street like hookers
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yea I got em bun
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Bridge: Kyla]
I just take my time with all this s***, I still believe in that
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay) Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Scarborough ting from time, G,
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy
A shot for me Yeah When I pull up on a nigga
Nails done, hair done, everything d'
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
There's times when I might blow like fifty k on a vacation
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
'Cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
And telling every girl she the one for me,
I took the team plane from Oracle
Don't get too involved
Lotta quiet time, pink bottles of Rose
Cause its on Yea girls its on,
Cause that's where I bring it,
I think we should rule out commitment for now
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
You already know though
Nails done hair done, everything big And my T-O girls, let me see your hands
When they get my s*** and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know They know, they know, they know
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Yes, still Roc La Familia
She got the keys to my Porsche and my Rover
Like I was average like that
I mean you say that like it's easy
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
You ever busted nuts in a two seater
We certified gettin' it C-M Y-M Cash Money business
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
I got 2 mortgages, thirty million in total
In the mall steady rackin' up the air miles
Bought out the store, can't go back no more
And I'm the one to blame
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
But we sure make it feel like we're together
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
They keep fallin' apart [Chorus]
They get a baller figure they ain't got to pick a career
Let's get right
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
Nails done, hair done, everything big
When you're no longer involved
I know exactly who you could be So just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
I can't stay here no more and I can't sleep on the floor
Then with your arms around me
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't s*** changed
Man fuck 'em all
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace I love you so much!
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Anything you down for
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
Mo' money bitches Comin' to you live
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You know they all actin' different now
That keeps me so off balance
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
We go fuck models then fuck go fuck neighbors
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
And you suck right now (and you suck right now)
Dom Rosé toast
We got that purple rain for the pain
Bounce that shit like, woah, woah, woah
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
I just gotta hit a road
Cause ever since I left the city, you
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But second chances, that ain't how you livin' Redemption on your mind I'll never be forgiving Yeah, I know Uh
I ain't lying I shoot
I do not fuck with your new shit
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
I don't even know maybe where my blunt ends
Taliban, Taliban
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I'm the youngest nigga reppin' Oh my God, oh my God
That she only see when she feels obligated
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Break: Wizkid]
Devil in a dress, Platinum Channel
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Caught in the life,
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Bright lights and Rhianna as a lady friend
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
This is celebration
You only live once, that's the motto n**** YOLO
You're not patient
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
If you let me, here's what I'll do
How you let the kid fightin'
No more I gotta go out and get, want you to know what I did
She knows, she knows, she knows But the good ones go
I just don't understand it Gyal a you mi waan
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
And I'm a be a legend even when this night ends
Ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Turn it all up
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
You be like "oh word, true shit?"
So instead of a verse being read
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Tell em I'ma need reservations for twenty
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
Momma is a saint, yes she raised me real good
Overthrowing your pain
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
Cause you're always busy doing things
All over your skin
That said last year that she slept with a canadian
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
I get money on money
It can't end like this
Do things when you want me to
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
No help, that's all me, all me for real
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Hit me when you done your shift
I got some women that's living off me
You left your mark on me
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooh Take your nose off my keyboard
Throwed back when I'm swerving
They don't love you like they used to man When you get to where the fuck I'm at
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
Cost a few hundred bands
She just tryna make it
Jealous people around me, I need to change my life
You make me feel like I did you wrong
And you could probably feel the breeze when the money's blown
Please, think before you come for the great one
Kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
Wooh, dance our dance, watch me dance
Wave em at the bitches hating on you with they friends
Ooh, ooh Hey boy I really wanna see if you can go
You know how that shit go With my woes Uh,
Soon as I go the text you goin' right is goin' say Ooh na na, what's my name
You know you know
But here's another nothin' that you made into something
Stompin' on this beat like a motherf***in' sigma
Who gonna be on the hook? Man what is you doin'?
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
Used to get paid for shows and front-door money
Front way, back way
Then eat in the kitchen like I'm in the mafia
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho) [Hook]
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing? I got my eyes on you,
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
I'm with it if you with it
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
A Mo City trip right now
Me and all your main girls get along too
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake
Cause I live in my workplace
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl, how 'bout now?
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
Let's just keep it private
I've been flippin' in the house
This is that nasty flow
And theres pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
Go Cinderella
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Hundred inch TV at my house
Girl you know I seen ya naked
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
First I made you who you are, then I made it
I fall asleep in sororities
That made me think of you so differently
Man there ain't no tellin' Yeah
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
Yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
Oh yeah, I'm on deck when you call me I'll listen
B**** named Crystal
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
I can't let it go
The naughty tings me want you do
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
Shut the fuck up hoe
Are friends I don't have anymore
Late night when you need my love
(Hold on) I know way too many people here right now
Show me a good
Trapping is a hobby thats the way for me
Cause now it's back to business
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
Pink bottles keep comin'
Come here, I make sure you get off again
You niggas they wishin' they knew yah
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
That kush I promise that's my dude
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
How I go from being the man that you argue with
I'm still awake I gotta shine this year
Man I guess I'm an optimist
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I get dollars on dollars then throw out them dollars them bitches gonna holla
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
This been where you find me at
And I like to finish what you think you started
Ye already know, yeah
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',
You know you gotta stick by me
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Keep you in the front, never in the back
Look I gotta keep watchin' for oppers
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
But when it's winter time
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Syd had a baby and treated me different
That's why you're always working out
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I could turn your boy into the man
Guess they plan on sucking somes dicks until some millions appear
Baby, come closer Me, me number one inna me city, yo
But you don't have the time to wait on me I tried with you
I know that you like it, Versace
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
But never ever have my bitches sittin' courtside
You in Chicago
I'm fuckin' her mind
I dig her like pookie that pussy be contollin' me
But you say you're over and done with me
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Make me call my bro Got the club goin' up
Twenty one years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Oh oh ooh oh oh ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart I'm more than just a number
Uhh, but I guess things change
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
I don't wanna do this with no one else
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Go to god for the hits right now
I'm beating the pot, call me Michael
Versace took over, it took out my soul Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
And they pockets going under like the Titanic
Come to take a s*** and urine
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle
And even if the team was religious with it
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
And I'm sorry
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Chain smoking in the house it's hard to breathe
Story stay the same I never changed it
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
I don't let it get to me Yeah
And they need some really big rings
Always workin' OT,
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here dog How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we done
Someone to make me feel lucky
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Everything I do on purpose
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Chicken fingers, french fries for them hoes that wanna diss
About the two cents I ain't never spent
'Did I go out?' yeah, I went out
Say to you
Free time is costing me more than it seems
So you can't drive it, and put on milage
Wanna come with me?
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Girl you got that ting I know
I'm mixin', I am not Esco but it was written
Who keepin' score 'cause these niggas, they losin' 'Cause I got a really big team
Chasing women a distraction
If I die, I'm a legend I'm up first, I'm on tour
Take the private, it's ugly out here we gettin' it
Hidden like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Before rap,
Bitches in my old phone
My nigga Biz said "The first mill gon' change you"
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I'm too good to you
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Guess it wasn't time, yeah
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
I peel them hundreds on hundreds
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
Riders rollin' wit me like eleven wheels
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga Boys tell stories about the man
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
At least do I get an invitation or something
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitresses
Triple white Jag
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Say my name, say my name
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
So look me in my eyes 'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
Big fame, big chains,
Yea, I'm in the city of the purple sprites
Wave 'em at the bitches hatin' on you with they friends
I had raped the game young,
I let off first then I let off again
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been 10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
vs. Me and mine
If I need to talk are you around?
I feed my family with this
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
If you thinkin' I'm a quit before I die, dream on
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
'Cause you just my type
I cannot complain, I cannot
Oh yes, Oh yeah You know what I'm sippin, I teach you how to mix it
I got it, yeah You don't wanna fall in love I know
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
I would never put you on blast when I get it Richer than the richest
For me to lace her up like my brand new Nike
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Whether that's right,
I say bounce that shit like woah
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
You changed up
Like Do you love this shit?
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Couple days on the beach
I used to have hood dreams,
It cost my 50 at Tiffany's
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May
I know exactly who you could be Just hold on we're going home
I go so hard with these riches
Who can I call for your information?

I love you more than I love myself,
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Nobu Nobu Nobu Nobu Nobu nobu
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
(x2) [End] All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Tonight, right now? 'Did I go out' yeah I went out, I went, I went to a couple of clubs
'Cause I'm right now ('cause I'm up right now)
Let me bend you over in your bra and your shoes
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
That new s*** that you got is overdue
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too

They loving the crew ooh Smoking weed under star projectors
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah
Every day, every day, f*** what anybody say
Take a shot and let it out
And the parties over, just don't forget me
Going places where you don't belong
Starboy deh suh Came into the game, no one replace me
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
Thank god that's finished
I think we shouldn't be together
I just called a gang of bitches out of immigration
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
I just hit a lick
Do you mind if we just menage just a little? Yeah uh huh
Yeah, look I don't know how to talk to you
Uh, last night was mad trill
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Me no like nothing come between me and me paper
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Shoot out the car with no lovey dovey
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
Listen, seein' you got ritualistic
If your girlfriend has went to any
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Blowin' purple clouds n**** I'm so sky high
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
James Bond coup pop-clutch, one hundred Bobbin' to the music
I count all these racks that I have on me now I'mma have you like woah
It could be purple, it could be pink
I just seen the jet take off they up to something
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Drinking on the syrup, taking medications
My life, now its changed,
You must really love the road life
And if you could do the same baby then well be for sure [Chorus]
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Please get the fuck off the property
You're like oh well
Them shows is back-to-back to back now
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She know I'm the man with it, uh
Money got my whole family going backwards
Big body my Suburban
I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone Ooh shit,
Babygirl gon' suck it 'til her jaws locked
Ooh, ooh Hey boy I really wanna see
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me [Drake on phone]
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
Aston Martin music, music (all night)
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu) Got everything, I got everything
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Only cause Ive drove and I done had a lot to drink
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo! Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck
Yeah, like controlla, controlla
I need someone to put this weight on [Drake and Woman on phone]
And when I'm in the booth, bitch the lion is loose
No, don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face [Verse 2]
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, like the new kid with the crown
Fly yuh in from distance away
I should call one and go home
All my niggas wanna do is pop style, pop style
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
Taking pictures of yourself
And since she'll have met another
B****, I'm goin' in
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug Whole time I was ready
I can't take it
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
How you mean, how you mean
Since 'Take Care' I've been care-taking
Oh yeah, very long time
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Usually they just leave when we done
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded
I, I, I, I, I I think I'd lie for you
Cause if I was what y'all created then I'd hate myself
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
How can something so familiar be so strange
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey Squad goin' up
Naked ring finger (check)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
