This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around (Yeah)
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Kings never die I want it, I'm coming to get it
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
"Daddy look what I made"
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
I done messed around and forgot my tec
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
Think I'd be back, did ya?
Bitch, get the fuck out of my face
And I lit a fire up under his ass
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I wanted a album so rugged nobody could touch it
Hi! My name is (what?)
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
Slim Shady The way you shake it, I can't believe it
But you may wanna find something more stable
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
I'm cleanin' out my closet Love, love
Come hizzon what kinda fizz-uckin' position is that You know, you actin' like you don't know
Maybe we took this too far I want a new life
That's when I wake up
First off you don't know Marshall
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
I can't call it
They are kinda giving me confidence
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
And said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling? Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassing me
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit
Everything is so tense and gloom
You still fly kites daily Catch me in my Mercedes
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
I know you got a job, Ms. Cheney
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road [Intro- talking]
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
And why I just don't know Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed! So long, bitch you did me so wrong
Daddy's so proud of you
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
Chance to party all the way to Sunday
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me. These ideas are nightmares to white parents
You get too big and here they come trying to,
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece!
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
they could blow away with the wind
Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
And understand the discrimination
Classic now, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
In your caboose
Maybe next year, I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
wack ass all up in my ear bitch bag back
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I swear that I won't let you down
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Fuckin' all your bitches, we can fuckin' give a goddamn
What are you doing here? Here to stay
'Cause it feels so empty without me A-tiskit a-taskit,
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
I don't know it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
You don't want that
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
When I was bout to talk right after you
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
And when I'm old and gray
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
(BTOV) {nate dogg]
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Til I snap
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Erica loves my shit
Just follow me
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
I didn't wanna go another round
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
Haters stay on his nuts
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
I've tried in this department but
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes It must be the ganja
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Let it shi-i-i-i-ine
You rollin' wit' a player
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
Til I have you at knife point, then you beg me to stop?
If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
Oh, he's too mainstream
I'm all outta gas, not so fast! uh your finger just went in my ass!
I know sometimes things may not
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit Two to the one from the one to the three
i'm really too young to be feeling this old
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
Like who's D12, how we get started
And what I need from 'em? no favors (I know you feeling yourself right now
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
I ain't never seen an ass like that
But I got your mom deep throating
The next day my mother said "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
Think about it before you walk in the door first
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Am I supposed to choke?
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
High off of love drunk from my hate
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
To take a stand (to take a stand)
In each other's shoes, at least
You's the projects nigga [Chorus]
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
Even D-J House fucked around and go shot
And though you say the days are happy
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
lets pretend, marshall mathers never picked up a pen
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
MC's get taken to school with this music
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
"I dont like this, no!"
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
The rest of my body is still being operated on
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Inside your living room
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
We ain't nothing but mammals,
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know You know, you actin' like you don't know
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
That's what they want
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
And my boy,
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session
And with a little time that should do the healin'
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Cause I'm... [Chorus]
I said get out bitch!
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through
hot beams steady shot clap your ass
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
These leaders of the free world rookies
There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it
But things have gotten so bad between us
Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
I Could be one of your kids
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berserk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?
I got my baby back
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant I'm standing in the flames
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
aint that annual annually knockin' the boots
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue
pay attention, you're sayin the same shit that he said
Always make sense to you right now
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Not the expression, no
Some girls are bout it bout it
I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
One of you tries to grab a knife
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
Tryin' to get this damn label off
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
And all the other guys just despise me because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
This world is mine for the taking
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
Life's too short to not go for broke
Damn.
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,
There's no limit on how far I would go
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
So let's go all the way dear
(Damn) Let me tell you
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
And why I just don't know Yeah,
Look at Kim
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
but oh well if you gotta go then you gotta go
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me
We're the ones who (chicka) made you The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
What it'd be like, to be me
I should have known better when you started to act weird
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late
The fire marshals no, the venue's too small
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
You're pac he's pac You're pac none This guy ain't no motha fuckin MC
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
Da da dumb da dumb da da You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
What are you doing?
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue You scary ass it was false alarm
And at the time every house that we lived in
No more pain bitch you
I say everyday she be givin' it up There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Obie rollin' with brews
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth
Til we get to Las Vegas Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
But it's just me I'm just obscene
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
Call my bluff and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
Was because you denied seeing me
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
And which motel which lake they found her in,
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom beautiful
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at? OK
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
But scars still remaining the same
Give every kid who got played at
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
I ain't hear a word you said
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
I can't be your superman
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
We all fall down,
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
"Well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene" If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on White America!
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Excedrin
Let down my guards swear to God
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
But then I see my baby
And only spread her legs to let me hit once Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky?
So it take it all Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
I'm here to rescue you
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
Something, something, something, something, I dunno Fuck it I can feel the heat rising
No you think I'm ugly
(With they car?)
Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Slim Shady
I'm gonna fackin cum (Oh shit)(oh yeah)
(No!)
In the meantime it's always mean time I'm getting by with my wicked ways
Serial killer hidin' murder material
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing
I wanna save you girl
I would call them in) - "Hey, I'm outside"
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
Look, two pees and a tripod!
What else is new f*** it what would Elvis do in your shoes
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Find the light, find the light, find the light Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
And take off their underpants
Comin' at you So if you'll still be my baby girl
Call me crazy, but I had this vision
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
If she keep her dinner down
Dre aah aah
Then they anus'll ooze
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
'Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
We're in Sin City
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
I am, I'm going to cum
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
This guys a hillbilly this ain't Willie Nelson music
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
You're like normal, fuck being normal
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
The way she's grindin that pole
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
Thats ok you look like a fucking worm with braids
And I'm so lost without you
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
And I produced the track
In one moment
Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
I starting to feel distant again
'Cause that's just the way she was They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
I noticed there's so many of them
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost
And now I'm fantastic
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
Find the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
O' Trice! [Obie Trice]
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
They said they found me on the bathroom floor Sometimes I feel so alone,
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!
But take this situation in which I'm placed in
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I'mma give you the world
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
It will be so empty without me Now this looks like a job for me
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
What I need? No favors
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
To shop at K-mart and it became art
Ha! go ahead yell!
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
And it's probably were I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
Fuck you looking at, hater?
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
You're coming home with me
Beer goggles, blind
So hold up your lights
Twenty five to life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
Nope, not anymore dear It cuts like a knife when I tell you get a life
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
My name is (who?)
(Why are you doing this?)
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
Pajama time
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turnin in his grave
Everybody (everybody)
This is my legacy, legacy
I was heavy once into drugs
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
Just lose it
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole
I promise to never go back on that promise
Well, that's nothing
I said saint, por favor
When I close my eyes
chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
Under your skin like a splinter
You take my breathe away
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!
That you just struck pay dirt
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
That's fucked up!
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin' shots off You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Everyday's just a holiday
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Bygones'll never be bygones,
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be I'm sorry momma
So I'm gonna get what I got coming and the rest I'm takin' I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
From a place that was dark as I was in
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
(crowd cheers)--- WOOOO Eminem (rabbit) freestlyes: This guy raps like his parents jerked him
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
People don't usually come back this way
Oh baby
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
I ain't had no luck with this,
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
As if this ain't some bullshit
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks'
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow
Love us but they hate each other They probably wanna take each other out
I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
Ha ha I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, i go acapella
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Inside it drives me crazy
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Afraid I never before
I promise!
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
I'm embarrassing you, and don't you dare say it isn't true
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
And date each other
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Neither do I
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Surely hip hop is never a problem
I know what you wanna hear 'Cause I know you want me baby
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
At all so don't grow partial
Too good to be true?
don't say shit, get your face lift
That was years ago
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Yeah, so what I'll do
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I ain't saying this shit again, ho, you know what it is It's a warning shot before I blow up your whole spot
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
If i had something on you I woulda did it by now
A banjo and manhole cover
Oh my god, I wanna fackin' fack
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king...
You want to throw me out? that's fine!
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
Between you and I
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
i'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow(ohhhhhhhhh) Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
You shitted on me on your way up
Put your picture on my wall
We all fall down like toy soldiers
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Yeah Dre, sick track Perfect way to get back
At least I know that I don't know
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
Eminem offend? No! Eminem insult
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
I'd laugh while you wept
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
Sitting on a bike in the sand
I want to dig my way to hell Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
We're the ones who made you So baby, baby, get down, down, down Baby, get down, down down
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
But they tell you put hands up
Caution to the wind, complete freedom,
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
Then you're gonna get decapitated
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Decisions, decisions
You and this boy Slim Shady!
Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
I'm friends with the monster
I'm climbing out this abyss
Full breast, ready to touch
Everything's gonna be alright
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
But hey,
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour
Oh, what's a matter Kim?
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Shaddy I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
(Oh my God!)
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
I want to dig my way to hell I've been a career a**hole
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
To these blue and yellow purple pills I've been to mushroom mountain
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Ooh boy just touch my body
Chew me up and spit me out
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Um num num touch my body
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
To these blue and yellow purple pills I'm at a rave, looking like a slave
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream I'm standing in the flames
But fuck it now I'm bout to draw the line
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!" Hi! My name is (huh?)
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
Sit down bitch
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
Goodness gracious
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out Fuck that, someone help Denaun
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim When you walked through the door
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
One just like a hood rat chick who was curious
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And ate the rapper, chewed him up and spitted him out
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs
On the wall of shame
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
I'm not guilty
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And what I need from 'em? No favors
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Then fuck it then break it up
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
Don't mistake it for Satan
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
Does this look like a big joke?
They keep screamin' your name
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
You morons think that I'm a genius
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
Damn! Where's my snare?
Helped him get back to the top
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
Just leave me and love him out the blue
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause I'm about to lose my mind
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Please stand up 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
Living in this world without you So long, bitch you did me so wrong
Play new games, say new names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kid")
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
I'm Mary Poppins, B
I can make her spin around
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry
It's what we into it's simple
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Now what's your name girl
Mercy, mark my words, ain't letting up, relentless I smell blood,
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Guess who? You miss me?
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
Straighten up little soldier
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished with me Valium spinach
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
Bitches they come they go
But I guess that's just what sluts do
Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Even when I'm right
Ha, bitch you get no (Love) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
I'm calling all girls
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
Damn, I think Kim Kardashians a man
To the same plant, and the same pants
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?
I'm not Peter Pan, I don't fuck with fairies
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
Until my legs (Until my legs)
'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!"
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
Let's go!
He's scared to death
First thing you said
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
An angry man's power will shut you up
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
This couch, this T-V, this whole house is mine!
Thats a private school
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Don't think I'm loyal
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
(And you don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
Back to bed!
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Couldn't snuff young 'cause
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Grab another one from out the stable
For good at least once in a while
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe 'Cause I can't be your superman
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
You really did a number on me
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
In the mansion
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And when the cops came through
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
I'll call you again,
Maybe we took this too far 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berzerk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
The gift of my absence
I say everyday she be givin' it up Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
The K, the I the D R O C K, motherfucker
Doing doing doing The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
Next time you'll show restraint
I don't know who you been listening to
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off,
Whip out, whip down Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
No homo', but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
Tell a friend Now everyone report to the dance floor
But I know something about you
With nothin' to gain
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Down and sending it to mastering to make it loud Enough dirt on you to murder you
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
Ow wait a minute, ow ow fuck I, I'm gonna fuckin' cam! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
Ha Ha
Shake that ass for me,
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
Good god, dip, do a little slide
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
I'm gone
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm so bad
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Desert Storm and both of us put together
You can't run from me Kim
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
swallow everything, that i learned
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful Yeah
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
I know it's confusing you
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way you're wandering?)
To try to stop my concerts early
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it's coming to
I ain't never seen a ass like that
And fuck this battle I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B;, I sing song
And some come walk from out the parkin' lot
I know there was a time where once I
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
Now, it all started with my father
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
Living in this world without you Come on get out
Ow that hurts! take it out now
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy bye
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
Yeah, I feel it too.
I have no life outside of that
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
Blow it out your a** As I fall deeper into a manic state
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
After coming home from a hard day's work,
But they might been around
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
And so what if he did? it's none of your dang business kid. My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Serious
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Overseas, church, Vatican
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take,
Turns right around and bites you
(Yeah, right) Shut your mouth, you dirty slut
You front you'll have to get me off your ass
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
I told you I can't sing
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
"Testing attention please"
And you know you are their armor
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
Put faith in lust, it ain't God I trust
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Yeah, right there, right there,
i'm at a point of no return. Yea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh I feel like dancing
'Cause she's kinda famous
But I swear one way or another
And forever we can drag this on and on
And its absurd how people hang on every word
Let's see if you can fit your feet In my shoes, just to see
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
take pictures of my rear end so you wont forget my ass
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
"Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Don't put out? I'll put you out
In this tug of war you'll always win
My name is
I knock a nigga face off
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
You don't think so do you
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Or if the crew can't wake me up
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
Who woulda thought
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
So wipe the smile on your grill off,
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage This guy dont wanna battle hes shook
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
Slash massive masturbator
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
Trailer trash i choke u to your last breath
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you I'm just so fuckin' depressed
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
If they were brown
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
And the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
But you won't get a crumb from me
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
You're a, rock star (baby)
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
Underpants
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out You probably think cuz it's been so long
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
(And you don't hurt me)
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Go to that place
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words? I'm so bad
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin' My heart is telling me to be different
I just want to be just like you
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Don't you know what felch means? Yeah, well then tell me
Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T.
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches
Never looking back, may hit the curb
Come on kemosabe
(Haha) Plasma
And fuck the whole universe I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
"Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"
End up with two back hands
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
It's me, my honesty's brutal
One day I was walking by
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe I know you want me baby
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
blah badi boo blah bah badi bloo blah
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
