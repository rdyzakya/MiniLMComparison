Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
Twenty five to life Too late
Tall girls
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
Psycho on a cycle
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
I'm a kill you motherfucker!
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
I don't rap to get the woman fuck bitches
Alright now lose it
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
aw, t. raw i'm so uh
Fucking peas in my plate
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Because I don't belong in this world
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
Yo, check it out Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Come sip on my gum drops
I love these hoes
So spread your feet apart
It's a movement, you can't stop it
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
To the kids who played 'em
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
Me and Shady deaded the past
I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much
Oh shit the shoot is comin'
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my Legacy, legacy, here
The morning rain clouds up my window
Get into an argument over a parkin' spot
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
But I don't need it.
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
'Cause I still don't give a fuck Zoning off one joint
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
Crusin' on the freeway
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
I'm moving on forget you oh,
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
I said, this looks like a job for me
Today is a painful reminder of why
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
There is no sun, and it's so dark
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
He ain't so hot now is he?
Fuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders
Yeah, yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I am white, I am a fucking bum
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
You did it, it's your fault
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Been wanting my cake, And eat it too
Fuck a trailer
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
I have you feelin' aight, I get you high as a kite
I know I should let bygones be bygones
Then I let you just go and just give
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
looking like a cyclone hit you
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
So bounce, bounce, c'mon, bounce, I said, c'mon, bounce
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
I just can't seem to get out this slump
Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God? Look
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And Wink did fuck my girl,
Doing, doing, doing
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
Just to see what we find
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
No boundaries no lengths
Thank you, God
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a f***in' year
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
Shut the fuck up!
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
(Kings never die)
It's not so bad Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
Oh, did I say "whore", Nick? I meant a liar too Like I've been goin' off on you all this time for no reason
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
And they need to take it up with me after the show
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
When they knew I was produced by Dre
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos
Now you know you're my world
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! If you could count the skeletons in my closet
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
Ah I'm coming ah yeah,
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Take your mother's warning, Roman
This is my life and these times are so hard
Stumble hobble tumble slip drip
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
I'ma kick the ballistics
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
Right at you
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
You know the name of the crew
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
All I hear is
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
It's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
I'm a take control of this relationship
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
And take away there freedom like you did to me
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
Go crazy
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre So what do you say to somebody you hate
Bitch are you retarded?
I am white I am a fuckin' bum
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
got the phantom out, no mats
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
Why don't you like me?
In fact grab a six pack
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
Skinny girls
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
Might wanna back up the data
Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
Spitten on your onion rings
Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
Your superman, your superman Don't get me wrong
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
I don't know it's just the way I am Shady, aftermath
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong Its fifty Shady! Yeah
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
Guess who's back? I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Bitch you get no love
I just wanna get high like you
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
Where they can be alone
You better ask somebody [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Bumpin and grindin that pole
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Look for coke to smoke No, oki dok
You left me off your list Fuck you hip-hop
Kill 'em with meanness
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
If you're tryin' to get out
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
am i really this cold
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
And here's an autograph for your brother
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Look, I can't change the way I think
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
We clutch
(You're tryna)
on some real shit though i like you
Nothin' can take her from me Woo!
Driving around with a smashed front end
"Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being"
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Oh)
Shady, Aftermath
Hit the lottery (oh wee)
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
White America!
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
"I followed you daddy
Is like shooting stars
Every hour, happy hour now
They're all like "Oh my God it's him"
Everybody only wants to discuss me
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
your still gonna sink
'Cause I'm happy Yeah, I'm happy
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
I'm way too up to back down
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
I don't know what words to use
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
But I can rap so fuck school
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
You know, I love you
I know everything he's bout to say against me,
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
To attack her character
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day
Throw the match at the passed up place So feel the fire beneath your feet
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
I'm not looking for extra attention
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Smash these vocals and do a performance
At war with a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'
All because I'm the lead singer of my band They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Bitch, shut the fuck up before I put all them phone calls out You made to my house when you was wild-n-out before Nick
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
How did you get to Sweden?
How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look at that, it's a Xanax.
And this one begins where the last one ends
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
S***.
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes Can we pretend that airplanes
Condom on my dick of course it is,
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
The only thing I ever gave up is using. No more excuses.
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Just grow wings and they fly, so
You stare into your stereos eyes
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Tell the public that I was so ugly
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Oh boy you drive me crazy
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
Without you
Fuck ya'll if you doubt me
Oh, I love the way you lie
And we're starting this party from dusk OK, let's go Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
From principal to the student body and counselor
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so so
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
quick someone get his ass another steroid
Just by the way that you keep lickin' 'em dicks
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Am I afraid of death
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
May I have your attention please?
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (why?)
Where you going, I'm leaving you
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
You and your husband have a fight
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Talk a little shit
No favors, no favors
That I'll be his resurrection
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
and all's well that ends okay
With wings I will fly I'm standing in the flames
(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on)
This guy's a gangster?
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
I'm high as a bitch up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
Down the street screaming
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
Here I'll scream with you!
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
He's so stacked that he knows
A sky full of lighters [Royce Da 5'9"]
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
I'ma treat these shell casin's like a soccer ball
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
You gonna be late for soundcheck
niggas swag jack, but this l.a. shit
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
Please stand up Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 3]
At first, I'm like all right
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
Make a single sound
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock
Talk of Tony Yayo, go [Chorus] can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
Damn Slim, Mariah played you. Mariah who?
You at a stand, still, mannequin
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You dare me to drive?
But then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps gettin' older
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
I'm a grown man
Bobby creek is in the place
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
That's ammo for my arsenal
Stop in a limo, hop in the window
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
Never mistreated you once
I just got some and I'm going back soon I take a couple uppers
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
Be good or be good at it
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong
These niggas is trippin'
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
And this load is like the weight of the world
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
Misses Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
And caught her stealin' my music,
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
Shady man no don't massacre the fans
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
With his Karl Kani
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
And it tastes like humble pie
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
What size you where? I wear tens
You've been driving me crazy
Then I'll still be your superhero
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
His son just woke up and he just walks in
That you might wake up with a guy On some new shit, I think I did too much
That's an Ambian each nap how many Valium, three
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bomb who shoots
Flip them, don't expect no help, now I could have either just
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
When they raggin'
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Simmer down
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
'Cause it feels so empty without me Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
Man no
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
When they know they're your heart
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
that makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'.
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
About to get my back tatted again
You think you cute, right?
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
Aah aah aah aah aah
All because I'm the lead singer of my band So I get off stage right and drop the mic
oh oh oh oh
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door
Is a sky full of lighters
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
That's why our baby mothers
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
And still I stick with this
I never meant to hurt you!
Live in the muck, never giving a fuck
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But I've been true to this shit givin' my heart and soul
Haters started to appreciate my art
Oh don't do that, don't, stop
Why does everyone always leave me?
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
Everybody has a private world
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time To all the weed that I've smoked
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Fuck it just shut up and listen Ey yo
And I realized, she was the crazy one
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
(Squee!) I love it
Though I ain't wrapped tight
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
i'm turned up i can't feel my face so My heart is telling me to be different
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah)
One shot two shot three shot four shots
Time to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
There you go
I miss my past
(Ah!)
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
I could run circles around you so fast
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo
And what i tell ya you better use it
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
Till I see dumb shit start happenin' Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
No love found It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
That's my new lifetime policy
Get the top down, let my hair blow
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
They'll put you in a jail cell!
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
you're thinking like an alien, it just aint realistic
I can get away anything I say and you will love it! The way you shake it, I can't believe it
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
And how I became hooked on val-i-um.
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
If I hear Iko
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
This flow is gon' bring more dough
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
makes no sense to play the game
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
And then I went platinum too
Dumb it down, I don't know how (Huh-huh) how-how
'Til the walls are going up
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
And mom, I know he's not around
Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
So I'm coming home tonight
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase 'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
When I blew seep and it was confusing
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
What are you, pit, rott, mixed?
For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady) Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-ha ha)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
And my night stands are full of open Bibles uh
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life I told the world one day I would pay it back
Now just wait til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
bout to get smacked back to the boon docks
I thought we wiped the slate clean
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
Find different ways to word the same, old song
And I ended up in this position I'm in
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
Illest s*** you could think I would say
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Born by whore lady
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
And you think I'm crazy
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
I swear, I swear man These chicks don't even know the name of my band
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
He's scared to look at his fuckin year book
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
(Kuniva you aight)
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
Comeback as if I went away
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
When you freaks see me out in the streets
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze And you only live it once
Trying to walk it off
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
Cause that Christmas you know the Nomonia thing
Shady lose
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I never driven a truck
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
But enough is enough Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
My mom probably got it the worst
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
With a about a million dollars with your mama
(Pedal to the metal) Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
Here, want a snack?
Slim Shady Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
Love, love,
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
Small girls
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
I know everything he's got to say against me,
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
I'll be right there for you
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
And you're such a fuckin' babe I wanna go down on you, fuck you shave!
And you could see why I'd be this way
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
It's (high class) meets (white trash) Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
I'm cumming (oh yeah) OK I'm done, I already came twice,
My blood type's the '80s
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
The Free World's got you gassed up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed?
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I'm not sure she's the one
My name is (huh?)
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
I'm breaking out of this cage
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
My insecurities could eat me alive
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
Now I'm Now I'm gonna make you dance
Jessica rest assure, Superman's here to rescue ya
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
To do it again, then, if he does it again
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
aye bitch, hey! There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
But I do know one thing though
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile My heart is telling me to be different
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, u the new kid on the block
I dunno where I'm goin'
And that f***er still talks to me he is all I can f***in' hear
Your superman, your superman We touch I feel a rush
The moment you've all been waiting fo
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
last so i'll
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Let's let our love unfurl
I am not Triumph, I am Ah-nuld, get dowwwn! The way you shake it, I can't believe it
And we're starting this party from dusk Now everybody from the 313
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
and shit to say back
Oops my C-D just skipped
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon
I think I'm losing control God, come one,
no return no return no return
You know you want it in your butt
(Damn!)
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
Saturday through Sunday Monday
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
It's a girl
And it's sick that all these battles
Bitch you make me hurl
But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
I don't know how to make songs like that
I pay the lawsuit and laugh, it's not a big deal
Straw in the gold chump I will spend
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
With a gaping hole in it
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
With a gat nigga and my tire is flat
And I'm Superman, mmm
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
We fear how we feel inside
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
Then you would know I've completely lost it
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Now some of you
Uh-ah! Temper temper! Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road And I just can't keep living this way
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
Ohh god damn, here I go again, I'm gonna cum I am! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
I'm taking my life back
(Sorry!)
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag [Bruno Mars]
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
But I'm movin' on with mine
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world
But, agree to disagree
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
No I had an interview not you two
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uhh,
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Look at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast Fuck off Yeah, right in your motherfuckin' ass bitch
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"
'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Oh baby baby aah aah It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
(Pedal to the metal) I take a couple uppers
Mind's like a pile of clay
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
If I was black I woulda sold half
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
Oho whoa-ho,
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
It don't matter,
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is'' dropped
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
Knife! Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
It's on manual
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Daddy's with you in your prayers
I went from powdered milk and Farina
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfuckin' gun
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
Stop it, stop it!
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
And use it to get myself wealthy
Oh my God I'm crackin' up
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
In no particular direction
This guy's a choke artist
I leave you lost without a paddle floatin shits creek
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
Don't I give you enough of my time
I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
And I should not be woken
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck the mall
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything It must be the ganja
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
So stop acting stupid, you so high
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Crown around it, thorns on it
Did I take it too far?
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
at his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, I go a cappella
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Look at my daughters face
To take a stand, it's been a ride
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
They'll be over) Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
Whatever's got into me I don't mind Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the chills
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
I think he's about to flip
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Climbin up this mountain your weak
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
We're running right back, here we go again
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick!
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
You don't get another chance,
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
there you go
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
Shady made me
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Look it's B.Rabbit
So that basically resurrected my cash flow I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again
This guy's a gangster, his real name's Clarence And Clarence lives at home with both parents
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
I watch her grow up with pride
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
Right at you I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
Marshall you never gone make it,
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie,
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
Is refresh your memory when you said, "I want you" Now should I keep going, or should we call truce?
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
You're coming with me, feel it or not
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
But you've extinguished this living hell
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
To keep up with the same pace looking boy 'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff
(Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?)
Full of myself, but still hungry
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
i used to like that show now you got me in fight back mode
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
Oh yeah girl see baby they call me Mr freaky,
You embarrassed?
And its just Too late for the other side
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli) A-a-a-a-all you lil' fagots can suck it
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse 'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
turn your wide screen on
Yo Slim Shady, come break these motherfuckers off Yo tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathing the wrong air
And the pants to match (Here mommer try 'em on)
Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
We're the ones who made you And that's why, my love, you'll never live without,
And let it be known from this day forward
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
You catch the bad one
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
And I'm armed with a firearm
Man f*** am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
The name is snoop too
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
And piss on the lawns of the White House
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
i'm at a point of no return. I'm hot motherfucker, get a plate bitch
hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek [Bobby Creek]
I don't believe it, it's almost to good to be true
himself in his leg with his own gun,
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
And we're starting this party from dusk And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent! It's bottle after bottle
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
You were just what the doctor ordered I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
I started a moshpit, squashed a bitch And stomped the foster kids
Mary P., Slim Shady
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
And I'll let you in ya work
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
You bet your sweet ass I do
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time I said, I'm sorry momma
But I smoke dope in a cab
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her
That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Even when I'm gone
It was like winning a huge meet
I'm African-American in America
You witnessing a massacre
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
Look look Now while he stands tough
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the... [Bridge]
Married to the game but she broke her vows
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
Ha! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy) [Eminem - Verse 1]
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
You know you want me baby
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
Alright ma, you win I don't feel like arguin'
I want to dig my way to hell I'm getting by with my wicked ways
Too have another half of gla** of wine sound asinine
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
It's your chance
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
If I ain't in it for the money, I'm in it for the P
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
We do what we say, you say what we do Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves I can't describe the vibe I get
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Got a shit-eatin' grin
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
loc's on, chucks low, black beanie dog
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
But those days are gone) Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
this shit is a Horror flick but a black guy doesn't die in this movie.
And the 10 Karat Kid with my triggers cockin'
To find his wife in bed with another man.
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you
Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Twenty five to life I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
We won't quit until we're banned from existence Persistence pays if that holds true
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
(You're drunk! you're never going to get away at this!)
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
Fack I'm gonna,
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
He's tryna d-dr-drown Shawty, when you dance
People shot all over the floor
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin' As time passes, things change everyday
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Yo, I'm still goin' do
You do know but actin' like you don't know You know what this is
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
To rock fellow, when I'm not even in my harshest
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
Here, tell this people something they dont know about me. Too late for the other side
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
If this is my passion
Shit With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
i bag bad bitches motherfucker kat stacks
How could you?
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
pretend he procrastinated and had no motivation
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
Wiped you and powdered you.
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
Motherfucker I'm grown
I like the sound of that, yeah
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
Your vcr tape cases with you Ambian CR great places to hide ain't it
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Now look
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
It go Ring-a-Chong, a-Ching-Chong-Chong-Chong-Ching
So I decided just to pick this pen
All I know is this much
To show you how much I adored you
I can up and cock the hammer
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
And a Heath Ledger bobblehead My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
Stiffen up that upper lip
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
With violent words and empty threats
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
This is niether the time or the place to get macho
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
(Homie, they spent) Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,
When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot Slim Shady, Slim Shady, I love you
You got me Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Either that or the mother fucker's been puffin' reefer
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
To deuce juice
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
Talk to me
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
They moved on to the next schmo who flows
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Vegas Whatever happens here, stays here
Hello? F*** you then
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down My tenement, too many now
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
I ain't never giving in again
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
i'm at a point of no return
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Your a supernova, and I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
Let's try to use imagination Can we pretend that airplanes
For four hours and you just said, "No."
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? You make me sick
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Well no matter what the cost
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
But up until the instant that I've been against it
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-of-shit
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
And what I need from em, no favors
Fack fack faack, (Fuck I am) (Ooh)
I could be one of your kids
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
One shot
Your superman, your superman 'Cause I can't be your superman
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see
It was clear to me (clear to me)
Its ridiculous
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
We'll be right back
But sometimes this shit just seems
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em apart
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Got out of bed at all
I'm addicted
And I try, sit alone and I cry
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
And butt fucked this game up
My band
Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
Oh fuck yeah, wait he's not out he's still crawling around up there,
But those days are gone, they're just memories
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
An upper class city having this happening
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Brit forget K-Fed let's cut off the middle man
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But I was put here not by accident
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
snap back them ain't even rare where the tag a what
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
Look at myself!
I'm about taking a risk, that might fuck up your life
I never knew my father neither
Hopping out with two broken legs
You're pac, he's pac, no pac
And scared to look in my eyes
On the floor stacked against the door
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
This is my legacy, legacy, here
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't Here to stay
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
i really can't see the end getting any closer
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
Who sat down too fast
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
It's survival of what? This is survival of the fittest
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
In the second week we were dry humping
Twenty five to life Feels like a close, it's coming to
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
But right now I'm on the inside
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the... [Chorus]
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine Now I hope you don't get mad at me
Kick it back in its face, my God
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
But not quite me 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
Yeah, you think I'm crazy I'm friends with the monster
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
To get their hands on every dime you have
Throw your spine out of alignment
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
Kings never die I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
To all the friends I used to have
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
The water that I drank
Damn girl I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
I will stand tall
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
so i'll end this shit with a fuck you and have a nice day {B Rabbit}
Hey, there's a concept that works
Please stand up Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
But tonight, we're alright
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
Can't be your superman
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't a said
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
(Yes!)
fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh!
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
You little shit you want to sit there and play innocent
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes)
Ha ha ha
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
And kids flipped
Like her lips I'm agitated, aggravated To the point you don't suck my dick
Too late for the other side
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfuckin' life
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
But before I tie a rope around this nob
it's just what comes from fame
The center of attention back for the winter
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped
Laugh at every single joke I crack
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I do it just to get your company hijacked If you like smack then I might too
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Little hussy ass fusses, 'cause fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit switched we're on the same script
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
Helplessness
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
From the second I was born my momma lost me
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
Fell down and I got right back up
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
And if the plane goes down
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Don't make me wake this baby
I don't see why these people always got my back
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Try them trailer parks
Man and I was on my way there
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
I need (a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life) It literally feels like a lifetime ago
Like whatever they say has no bearing
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
Strive for perfection, this much is true
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
Living in this world without you On the first page of our story
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Yeah that's right (It don't hurt me) And I don need you (No more)
He shuts a whole motherfuckin' Walmart
It's a beautiful kind of pain
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
it's about time you admit it who you kidding man
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
And she got hit now she yellin'
I'm still standing here screamin' fuck the Free World Don't ever try to judge me dude
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
That's under my bed
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
(Look baby)
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Hipidi hoo bla
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
but those days are gone they're just memories
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
(Where'd everybody go?) This is survival of the fittest
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles In my shoes, just to see
Throwing her over furniture
Just promise me you'll think of me
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
S*** must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate
Gimme the mic
So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
But I already told you my whole life story
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
To every time I reminisce
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
Like I don't think anyone's real,
Aah aah
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
I said look at him!
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get
But everybody just feels like they can relate
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
Oh baby baby aah aah It's Friday and it's my day
I'm a meet you at the club we goin' fuck these hoes up [Chorus] I never seen no shit like this is my life before
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Just as soon as I walk in
I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
Oh I'm so fucking hot, and you're so fucking hot,
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
I go the machete from O.J.
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom, my mom,
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain't the same
I think I love you baby
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
You hungry you fucking brat?
Has taken four years just too put out an album B
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
You think you saw this basket first?
Yeah we fucked
See me, we fly
My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn
The stress has been eating me, recently
From where they need a handout
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpses Jack Kevorkian"
Don't mean to ruin your plans
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
Fuck what these cynics say
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
I'll guarantee they scream, "Dre, don't leave us like that man!" cause I'm about to lose my mind
I'm a little bit sicker than most,
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Too much pride
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
Young Money yeah uh Ah, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
Ha bitch you get no love
He ain't got shit to do with it
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Like he got carrots up his ass-crack
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
(Pedal to the metal)
Cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both
Better be careful when you bring my name up
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
'Till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
So will the real Shady, please stand up
I'm cleanin' out my closet Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
My band The hottest boy band in the world
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK (Fart Sound)
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
(Woo) Meanin' I'm on fire off the top
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
But I'm actually weirder than you think
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad
Been gettin' laid and paid, that's why I never complain
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
This is the winner takes it all so take it all Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
With you I have zero strength
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
But I promise momma's gon' be alright It's funny
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
This is for children who break rules, people that straight fool
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
It just ain't realistic
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
But I love you so much it hurts,
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
If you read my mind you can see my pain
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker). I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
Kick back while I kick facts
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
Baby you're so precious
I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the f***in' maestro, I'm like nitro
And I can't change the way I am
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
But when it's bad, it's awful
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry momma!
No love, ha
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
I mean girl just touch my body Where's my snare?
A tragedy from fucking passin it up got to me
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
All I do is rap
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Alright stop
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity Now was called Eminem but he threw away the candy
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you (Okay)
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
I'm divorcing you
Baby, get down, get down Baby, get down, down down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
But it's over now, It's too late to save our love
Red pills, blue pills and green
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
Your as addictive as they get
Life is wacky now
Wanted to receive attention for my music
You do what we say and we'll do what we wanna do We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your program
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
And don't squander it
When I'm drunk as fuck
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
My band You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
Or try to live up to these expectations?
He does not mean to lesbian offend
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
Cause I'ma— Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
now pretend things just make him angry with this shit
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
But if I offended you? Good
And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Until I met Dre
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
Like we used to be when we were teenagers
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
Shopping the demo with gun point
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
Everybody from the 313
Because... This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
Matter fact bake me a birthday cake
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary,
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
This free worlds got you gassed up
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't
And they were instantly hooked right in
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Even if it sounds corny,
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
It gotta be acid, 'cos the X is gone Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
And then a world tour just to top it all off
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin'
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I've calmed down now
I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice
'Cause there no such thing as half-way crooks
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
Just having to balance my damn self
(What the fuck!)
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
I think I love you too
It's nothing
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
I got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't goin' shoot you
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake ('Cause I'm a) I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
Feels like no one can beat me Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up and follow me
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
What difference it make?
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
I love the way you lie
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 2]
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
Has an erection for me and thinks
And now all I wanna see
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
That's daddy baby
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
Till I see some naked bitches dancin' around, drunk, touchin' each other Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk I wanna, roll away like a Rollerblade
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Appeal with the skin color of mine
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
And that goes for Nick too
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Your tasin' them with like pages in
I'm at a point of no return. Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
You got me captivated
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
Kings never die I can hear the drummer drumming
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
You do know but actin' like you don't know When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
Bit by bit, torn apart
And we can (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off! Hi! My name is (what?)
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Know that I was strapped with gats
Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
Let's call your sister 3-way, have some threesome, me so horny
Bust a nut, get some rest
It's real easy just follow the beat
But as days pass in this shit
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow
Let Bizarre nut I take a couple uppers
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
'Cause in a blink of an eye
Guts over fear, (I shall not tear)
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
nobody's ever done it like i did it my heart is telling me to be different
He slept through his plane and he missed it
What's your sign
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
Fuck you, you did this to us
You'd give an arm for
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Once or twice but who's countin'
Oh well, I tried
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But it feels so empty without me
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But nothing compares
But all you savage cats
Glass is shattered from the fight
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
High off chronic
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Please, I'm a human being!
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
My body aches when I ain't
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
It's your chance for a little romance or
Ya I know
Fuck, I'm gonna start lettin' off
So here I go is my shot.
I'm sleepin'
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
I apologize even though I know it's lies
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
talkin about shit's creek
I'm not phased,
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Now I'm pissed off Sit back, homie, relax
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show' I'm sorry momma
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away {lotto}
What now nigga what now what
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
I guess we would have to walk a mile
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes
Or statistic of this shit 'Cause after I spit the bullets
fucking with lotto dawg you gotta be kiddin'
And the group that said motherfuck the police
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
My children will carry me
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
And what I need from 'em? No favors I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
And bust open like broken water mains
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
I tear the club up fo' sho
This whole crowd looks suspicious its all dudes in here
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
matter fact dogg heres a pencil
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
So i'm gonna turn with a great smile
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
i feel bad that i gotta murder that dude from leave it to beaver
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are I was afraid to
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
No love
I down a couple downers
I'll make ya sit there
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
You own it, you better never let it go
Came to sip vodka, shit
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
And yell, "Wait!", pleading—but screaming is pointless
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
To all the people I've offended
he pretends that .. [Chorus] can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
Its true that I had a few
Tell her you need a place to stay
Until next Thanksgiving'
Sit up front
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this And I would've done anything for you
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
Superman video I was in the back
So you know where I came from
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Go inside each other's mind
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
But no matter how many fish in the sea
and i swear i got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
My OCD is conking me in the head
Not a jealous man, but females lie
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
get your camera out uh, one flash
We're all right where we should be
Excuse me, (my name is) (who? My name is)
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
Conversation and Hennessey
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
I feel like singin'
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,
Fack, I just came again, okay pull it out now,
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
You and I
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Nick, I ain't never seen a ass like that
Girl you out ya alcholic mind
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Mother fuck all your comparisons
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
They want you, Marshall
The way she's grindin' that pole
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
Fuckin Nazi this squad ain't your type
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
But then she comes back to me Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash I say it proudly
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
But I sure would fall for that
I can only tell you what it feels like
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
Everything lined up for the taking
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Check ya wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
I put both hands on your throat
What daddy always tell you?
Yeah, I'm right here
Feelin' kinda breezy
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Except for these bitches
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
Am I too loud for you?
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
Sippin everything from white grain
Fuck am I gonna do?
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom loved Valium now all I am is a party-animal
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I) I will not fall
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
(My penis in your anus)
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
That made me put up with her psycho-ass over 6 months
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
'Cause I'm on a rip this mystical slick shit
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
All I ever felt was this
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Critics'll end up in critical
And get live with that which gets me high
'Til one night he snuck in and said
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
To appreciate me, differentiate me
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
Bitch you make me hurl 'Cause I can't be your superman
They'll lock you away!
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
As long as the song's getting airplay, I'm dissing you
Let's get it started (go ahead shake that butt)
Literally give an arm for
take sum real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
you wont amount to shit, quit day dreaming, kid
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack I be the do wa diddy up and down you block
That's right (It don't hurt me) I don need you (No more)
4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm s***tin' on the competition
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
And she's on top, I'm gonna fackin', oh god,
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
My Valium, my Valium
You're only making this harder on yourself
From in-school to before school to out of school
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Just to get to this place
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
I know I let you down
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it You know, you actin' like you don't know
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
I dreamed of being that cool kid
When it spins, when it swirls
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
To be kicked down
No not fuck, I said fack ,
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
And what I need from 'em?
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel tow
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
With a Walkman on
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
Shake that ass for me
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
And to think I was gone I was afraid to
quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms 'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic (I-I-I-I-Is)
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I cant keep chasing 'em
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
D12!
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
Does Bizarre smoke crack? We can't get jobs
Every rhyme I say, a**aults you like an ultra violet ray
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is "evol"
(Shit that's the clique we beefin' wit I swear)
And I'm aiming right at you
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
Then I fall in bed with a bottle of meds
I ain't playin' go find you a white crayon
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
Now I lead a new school full of students
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Aw look at daddy's baby girl
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
Come be in Shady's world
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
I don't have any lines to go right here so
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
And look at where it's at
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
Can I get the attention of the class (huh my name is, what my name is)
(I love you!)
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) shake your body Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Now you're in each others face,
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
[Nate Dogg]
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
Hailie Jade I love that name,
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
Cause now I'm in the Aston
If you had
But baby we're in Sweden
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
This is do or die
(Woo) I made a pact with the Devil that says, "I'll let you take me
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
Roxanne
'Cause every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
You don't know what the fuck i've been through But i know something about you
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
What year is this?
I stunt I style I flash the shit
Thought I said to wait, had four doors
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
I'm kinda in the zone
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And all the medicine you fed us
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
It's too late to start over
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Now step back to reality
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
And five I hit, ah, shit
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
It's nuttin' but some cash You know, you actin' like you don't know
Not over this shit (Stop!)
Butt squeezing it's the season
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
And there's really not that many of us
I'mma sing for you
You said you was king
My name is (what?)
Slim Shady Hi! My name is (who?)
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later Tell ya boyfriend
I should download her audio on mp3
And gay into the A.M
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
Clique too big, bread? Gotta break it
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
And use my enemy's words as strength
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
Radio won't even play my jam
Shady's back, tell a friend
And when you acted up thats when u got jacked up
I think I love you baby I think I love you too
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
so they tell me that they love me i know better than that it's just game
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
'Cause someone told me that
Kamikaze strapping a mother fucking bomb across me
I guess it was never meant to be
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh
Under my bed and up under my faucet
One moment
I love you I'm getting by with my wicked ways
In Harlem only in Boston
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
Bitch so what?
The pictures we been painting, my nigga
'Cause they full of shit too
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
he's gonna have a hard time explaining to hailey and lainey
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
(It's not that!)
my motto fuck lotto
With a night came to the matinee
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
So everybody, everybody
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
Here today, gone tomorrow
The best part about me is I am not you
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I'm so bad
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
They just don't see my real side
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
And we're starting this party from dusk Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
I feel like dancing I smell something in the air that's making me (high)
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
'Cause it feels so empty without me
It's lust its torturous,
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life Hi! My name is (what?)
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
There goes another lawsuit
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
I almost break down and cry
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late [Chorus] (Nigga I been tryna call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
Legacy, legacy First verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on a island
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
Go call you a lawyer
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Maybe I'll love you one day
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
rozay bitch let the champagne drip
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you
And let you keep me down
Hang it up, flat screen
My boy future is an Uncle Tom
mad as ??
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
Now who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Please have faith in my words 'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
To get to this one
Real name no gimmicks Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Until the roof (Until the roof)
I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I want to dig my way to hell
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
I'm out of control like no
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin' Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma!
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism The devil ain't on the level same as him
No one gave a fuck I was white
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Monday through Sunday yo
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Lloyd Banks, Cashis, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50,
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you Nobody asked for life to deal us
I don't want to go on
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom [Rabbit]
Stop, don't, I don't mean don't stop!
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)
Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
i got a better chance joining the kkk
I think I'm losing control
He can't get with me spitting this shit wickitly lickity shot a spick-a-spickety splyt lickety
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!) Goddammit I'm sick of this group
I don't know how or why or when
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
You know what man I'ma say somethin
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
And color a fuckin' zebra My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives (Shittin' on rappers)
Uh huh
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
When I overdosed would have caught a flat If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
(Get along with)
I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Cause what goes up must come down
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
What's it called again? I'm blanking
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
Man, you must be up out your mind
It's actually disastrously bad
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
Wow what the f*** happened last night where am I
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids? Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Roman!
You waited this long to stop debating
(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Put your mother fucking hands uplook, look Now while he stands tough
Doing doing doing Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
The only one who looked past
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
To these blue and yellow purple pills Cool, calm, just like my mom
It's on till the break of dawn
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
(Baby)
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'm a hang a sign up
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause (They say kings never die
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn Y'all niggers intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Everyone report to the dance floor
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
Fuck everybody
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
marshall youre never gonna make it
Yeah fuck you to
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
Slim Shady Hi! My name is (what?)
I don't want to die yet
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
bitch you can be up piss creek with paddles this deep
Here, tell these people somethin' they don't know about me Mm
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit!)
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
I'm cleaning out my closet Can we pretend that airplanes
It's not so bad Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin' pop
Shady sits on the shelf
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
Every fan black that I got
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
I love the way you lie [Bruno Mars]
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Obliterate anyone in the way
didn't you listen to the last round meat head
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
This substance equals cuffs
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
Please stand up
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Black girls
So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with 5'9′ but I feel like I'm 6'8″ [Bruno Mars]
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
I can't find mommy, where is she?"
Some girls they act retarded
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
I don't see us ever being together ever again
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Fuck a Papa Doc
She panics and he gets his throat cut
It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
You signed me up to battle?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Made a living and a killing off it
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
The sky darkens, my life flashes
no return no return no return no return
So everybody just follow me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
A sky full of lighters [Eminem]
Shit,
Fuck shots! I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
Stop holding your breath
I'm like "My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?" White America!
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Causing hospital accidents
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
With rock, shock rap with Doc
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
I think about more than I forget
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
I wanna grow together
Sponsors workin' round the clock
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
So this must mean I'm disgusting
Hi! My name is (huh?)
Player, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's
Strictly to show they support us
Crazy, I am back and I am razor-sharp, baby And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
That's about as far as your buddy goes
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
No labels wanted to sign me
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
When I caught a guy
Or one opportunity
I said I'm sorry momma!
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
Some, something, something, something
so i'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Acting stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Damn! Mom
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
I ain't leavin' without you bitch
And while this is goin' on
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
But I'm only going to get this one chance
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (cause why?)
I'll spit a racial slur honky sew me
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I got you caught up in the rapture
I'll say it all for you I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
And these niggas know I lay them down, make them beg
So she hear me wrong
Just to see what I'd be like to
Can't believe it now you're two
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
And all he does is eat Dorritos and Cheetos
The muthafuckin' spokesman now for White America!
I'm squirting and she's not gettin' off,
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right
Right at you So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want
and it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)
He's lookin' around this club
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
I'm cumming (oh yeah) I never seen no shit like this,
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Well I will you'll be in the trunk So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I'm on the patron
She used to tell me he hated me
We just met and I just fucked you
(Mm, I don't know!)
Everybody, I guess I had to
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
And I just can't sit back and wallow
You want what you can't have
From fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
So He must be hearing shit
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
You have the same passion that I have
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
We bout' to have a party (turn the music up)
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
His real names' Clarence
So if love is a chess game, check mate
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
Get loose put some more of my juice
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Fuck you tipper Gore
Gin and tonic demonic
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
i hate to do this i would love for this shit to
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game 'Cause I'm about, like a f***in' echo
Ah somebody help!
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
I have no snare on my headphones
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
Plus it's getting darker by the day
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin'
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so,
Come be in Shady's world Oh boy you drive me crazy Bitch you make me hurl They call me Superman
And I ain't givin' in you're gonna
I hate you! I hate you!
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
go home write some shit make it suspensful
i really can't complain, everything is kosher
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
That will do whatever the fuck
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
these food stamps and this weak shit
But in the evening I gotta go,
You know what time it is, so why ask?
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life May I have your attention please?
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I wanna fuckin' sing
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I got my grimy Shady with me
Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some slut, bitch-cunt
Doing, doing, doing The fuck is wrong with you?
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat Sometimes I feel so alone,
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
It's not so bad Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
This roof is cavin' in
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain
To send my serenity powers
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
You think I give a fuck!
How I nutted early, 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
Cause the DJ playin' my song
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
'Cause we need a little controversy
Damn I see Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying, "Cut the tape, cut the tape"
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Look at your husband now! (No!)
Get a grip Marshall
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
Started thinking my name was fault
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
We got you on tape
I pack up my nose with coke
I'm too cool to go back
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
With a magnum
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
'Cause anytime things went wrong
Twenty five to life I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Let's all stand up My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Tightenin' around my throat
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
I don't give a damn what you think
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
So I guess it ain't
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
Compared to a weed high
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
Fuck Cranbrooke Fuck a beat I'll go a capella
Forced to fight
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
Setting fire to yesterday
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
Might still be in that place
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
I do live in a trailer with my mom
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Without you Hi! My name is (what?)
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
Yo! this blunt's for you
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
I'll be one tough act to follow
but it didnt fall on his lap so he aint even here
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
And the fangs been out since then
Come be in Shady's world Oh boy you drive me crazy
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
Two little beautiful girls
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again To all the weed that I've smoked
To these blue and yellow purple pills Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Now grab this Cuisinart
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is"
That's the sound of the glock
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
you see how far these white jokes get you
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude) (It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute)
But you have to walk a thousand miles In my shoes, just to see
A lyricist without a clue
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
, none This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shake that ass for me [Eminem]
and play with his friends
Don't ever try to judge me dude
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
Wanna hear something wick-wack?
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips I get all the money, pussy falls like rain
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
That's on Nick's back I'm obsessed now
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
To do black music so selfishly (hey!)
(Is you hit?)
People will still camp out from the night before
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
Like feeding Michel'le helium
And I love it, wait
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong The guns spark when the shots go off
And you still don't know me So blow me bitch, I don't rock for cancer
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
So get this dick, I'ma live this I'm livin' life in the fast lane
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
It's gon' say 'The whole rap game passed away'
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
And I show no shame from coast to coast
1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?
y'all just do not fit the picture
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying
I'm here to save you girl
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas? I'm so bad
And his girl Ha ha, Nate Dogg My mom loves Valium and lots of drugs
50 told me to do situps to get buff
And everyone just heard you let one rip Now I'm gonna make you dance
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
You ain't gonna make me cam,
I know you want me baby
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Put your mothefucking hands up
It's shady
We're the ones who (chicka) made you Back by popular demand
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
Get 'em I'm alive again
Feel your pain, you feel mine
This is Stan My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
Who you think brought you the oldies
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Well guess what, daddy's here
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
You high baby?
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
its about time for me to move on
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,
The weight has been lifted
I poured my heart out to you,
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
I ain't never seen a - ass like that
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
With a blue new rag
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
When I was underground
That was funny wasn't it?
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
Your man don't want it, Drumpf's a bitch
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans
Dre just let it run
You know I want you too
Love the way you lie I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Your better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!
They got the discovery channel don't they?
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that Airplanes
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake I'm about to lose my mind
I'll be your savior from
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing
Obie
I like boobs, boobs, boobs, now see that gerbil, grab that tube,
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
Doing, doing, doing The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
And he said that I eyeballed him And if you fall, I'll get you there
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your frigity-friends
Nick, is that your wife?
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Kim, Kim!
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile to the trailer park
You get the message am I getting through to you?
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
(Well I can't just leave 'ey alone, what if she wakes up?)
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
Like damn we just swapped
Ew ew ew ew Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
Oh wait a minute oww put it back in, in in in
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"
And I get to much P to ever be no homo
That I do all types of retarded shit
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
This guy's a gangster; his real name's Clarence
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
I got a laptop in my back pocket
I leave the club with my tab still open
Everybody knows
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
Chased him with a stapler
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***
Suddenly I'm not crazy
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Before I ever got Myspace
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I'm a name her Bonnie
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
On top of the affidavit Graduated from master debater
Next time, there will be no next time
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
Quit hollerin' 'Why, God?'
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
No favors, no favors If she was flavor I won't savor
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
Would you capture it
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
That's all it took
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
And you can never break my stride,
lets pretend, things woulda been no different
What you say? (What's wrong?
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
Everybody (Everybody)
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! "Did you get him?" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
Too late
'Cause there ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
And his boy,
he wasnt socially akward and just strange as a kid
Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But what happens when karma
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Yo! I miss my past
Now what you say?
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
Got no ring on this finger now I'll never let another chick bring me down
Should I just give up
Ya little mother fucker,
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
But, until then,
I can not moonlight on the side
Nobody listens to techno
if you thinking i'm gonna quit before i die dream on
I'mma break that birdies neck
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didnt make it to the rap olympics
Speed, shrooms, down the Valium
Don't want to see you, (No more)
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
Run along!
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
and i'm ready for that i'm just saying
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And there's a million of us just like me
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
Girl you just blew your chance
Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me
This is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
I'm from Atlanta
How the fuck could you do this to me?
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
Just a bunch of gibberish
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
D-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round And he came to the club tonight
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
Please!
Before they ever noticed my face
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are
She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
This stage is my pedestal, I'm unstoppable, incredible
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
But f*** it, suck from the tucket
I can hold you in the morning
So why don't you all sit down
Roman!
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
Give me an awkward eye
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,
And I think my neck is breakin'
Hands up, reach for the sky
But don't you place the blame on me
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
Doing doing doing
Where must I go, who must I know
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
Now I gotta straight born infant
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
You think I'm ugly don't you
For a dad to show up who never did
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
And show these people what my level of skill's like
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
With the ugly Kardashian
Little gay looking boy
So before you're leaving this Earth
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Gave me a chance
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
Caught in a chase
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
You outta work, I know it's tough
And these guys they can find every area code Bitch carry your own
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
And wanting it both ways
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
How could it ever be just us two?
That's gotta count for something Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
The future seemed so bright
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And I'm not gonna be Here to stay
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate (Now break it down girl) When you walked through the door
But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Living in this world without you You really fucked me Kim
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
Being gay little faggot but by the way
Or in the parking lot circling,
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
1 pac 2 pac 3 pac 4
Circle jerk, touch my body Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back
They say I was running butt naked
Everytime I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
Know what it's like
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Just know that I'm alright
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater
All the pain inside amplified by the
No love, and I don't need you (No more)
What am I sayin'?
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
To Michael Jackson activator
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Spell it backwards I'll show ya Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again
Ha! ha! got you!
This is the winner takes it all so take it all I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
The thunderstorm has passed ya
I'm in the mood to strut, my A-K ain't even tuck
The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
I'll put it in your cunt
So it's only right that I right till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Follow me around, and wiping my ass
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
What else could I possibly do to make noise
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
He nose dove and sold nada
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
Roll Hall of Fame
Yeah boy shake that ass,
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version
And that's not a stab at Micheal
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
Didn't think I'd remember?)
For all the times I let you push me around
I'll tell the motherfucking slut to her face
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
Bowl filled with hash, pockets stuffed with cash
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke It must be the ganja
lookie how can six dicks be pussies?
My eyes ain't clear
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest This is my legacy, legacy, here
Someones gonna touch my body
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
So take it all So get your ideas, stack your ammo
You want me to tell you somethin'
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
Psych! I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
Your a disgrace
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!" Now this looks like a job for me
Vegas
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
I'm just doin' my thang, you know The Units the game
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma!
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
So here I am and I will not run
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve! This is survival of the fittest
I want to dig my way to hell Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Others get the hit with the laugh
And how they attacked the victim,
He can give her some, she can give him some
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
But this time I'm a
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
Fuck it,
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
From here on out it's the Chronic II
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
I'm a pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Slim Shady! So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Slim Shady Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
And even if I could it'll all be gray
In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I came to claim but the game ain't
But I told Nate you was a freak
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
Little Eric looks just like this
Everyone's leanin' on me
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
Can we pretend that airplanes
Because I put my faith in my new girl
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen
He decides to rob a liquor store
And made me Robin Williams crazy
So bad they should put his a** in prison
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
How the fuck could you do this to me? So long, bitch you did me so wrong
This is what the fuck I do
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
However you prefer to do
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
pretend he'd just stay outside all day
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
Just know that I was alright
You know the aim is to bang you
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Drop in the lap of a tax evader
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
And this bag, of this weed
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
HK to your chest plate
Then I'm have to take it And then after takin' that
It was neither,
A killer instinct runs in the blood
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
How did you get so big?
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece [Chorus] I don't know dude
'cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
And still weren't found out
"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
'Cos our arms show tracks
Yesterday I changed your diaper
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man Whatever
See I'm just like you in a way
It's the marijuana
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth Bitch I'm a kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
Oh my, Em
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like this shit's hoppin'
I'm just trying to unwind
Feed it a fucking Aspirin and say that it has a headache
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinn!
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
The only fear I have is of loathing
After it bothered ya fathers
These shrooms make me hallucinate
The hell if I know
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
i'm at a point of no return. One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
With 5'9 [unverified] to hold this bitch down
(That's ill) I take a couple uppers
Don't never try to judge me dude
You're Pac, he's Pac, Yo Pac; none
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
Pretend he just made excuses that
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
And I can't see at all
But now that I got this little company
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal So fuck off
Are like shooting stars
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
You went to Cranbrook
And how real is that
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Who hate the world as much as each other
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
This Guy keeps screaming he's paranoid
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
Who
It's so appeasin' Now I'm gonna make you dance
Just sprays and sprays
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
I was not afraid to die
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
Oh my God I love you
Maybe we'll someday grow
I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I'm cleanin' out my closet Ha, I got some skeletons in my closet
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you Bitch I'm a kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'm a conceal you
Til we get to Las Vegas Yo, I can't sing good
Nothing new since '76, Kid Rock
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Bitches they come, they go
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
We're going to have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Find the light, find the light, find the light Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than making another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
And ever single teenager that hates school Fuck off My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Little sleepy head
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
Came to party
Oh but it feels so fackin' good! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath,
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
We can only get brighter
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this) Alright, stop! (Huh?)
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
I'm a park my car and walk the rest of the way
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Never loved you enough to trust you
So starting today
Lonely roads, God only knows
Let's do the math
Guess who's back
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
Please stand up,
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh huh!)
Watchin' this world pass me by
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
Cum I think my rubbers comin' off,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
Shit's gonna get thick again, they say the
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Had an accident when the Trojan broke Ah, poor baby
How many verses I gotta murder to,
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
So I've been sent here to destroy you
You act like a motherfucker's brand new at this shit
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater Don't it make sense
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Look Look Now while he stands tough
you need to get your cranium checked
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
I just opened enough eyes later on
I'm cumming (oh yeah) Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
I got bars, sentencin'
Baby, get down, down down
And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
To all the drugs that I've done
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Is that a tank top or a new bra
and just lazy as shit
I told him that you like it from behind Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Inside your world
(Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys) When I just a little baby boy
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
Who's that in the cool blue back
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
Now I ain't much of a poet
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
Ow fuck I think it's stuck
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
I swear to god I hate you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
I'm single now
look snoop dogg just got a fuckin' boob job
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
I done touched on everything, but little boys
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
Damn somebody hit me from the back
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
(What about Eminem?)
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel
They said save it boy
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
I'mma work for everything I have
Not just based on my description
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
Yeah?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by" Sometimes I feel so alone,
And you take that to new extremes
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
You won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin' I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Weed got her so chinky eyed
I know you want me girl, in fact I see your grin (Now come in girl) When you walked through the door
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
Some girls are bout it 'bout it
Ward, I Think you were a little hard on the beaver
It was a black Mitsubishi
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
I say move a bitch move So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves, a rebel
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
so was Eddie Hasko, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
We're all we got in this world
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
No more crying, wipe them tears
You like this
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco
I'll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Body smelt like vomit Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
So you can lie to Hailie I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you
I got your girl in my arm
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
And pull you apart from both angles
And you can't see, the b****'s hair is frizzin'
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakin'
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
Change the station I hate this song!
Just enjoyin' the ride
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
And take a vacation to trip a broad
but I'm man enough to face them today
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
(Well OK) Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
We'll be friends
Just go aah aah aah aah
(Nigga what about your wife)
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
yeah
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow
I owe you for this one I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
What this pretty little dame's name is
Now everybody from the 313
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
Cause you never know when it could all be over
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
tank top screaming lotto i dont fit you
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
For any nigga wid Hammer
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin'
When it whirls, when it twirls
One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But oh its so fuckin' wet and soft,
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
And flew you and momma out to see me
No taste buds, hoe later
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
'Till we get to Las Vegas
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Slim Shady My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
But if this is all there is for me life offers
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
Because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
Now you get to watch her leave,
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Oh baby baby aah aah Um num num touch my body
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot,
This is 34 bars, we ain't even a third of the way through
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
But I don't want to swallow it without chewing it
I love you too
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
These shell casin's is just like a bag of paper
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Take it and take a nap, eat it,
Pumped the feeling
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
I'm cumming (oh yeah) Oh wow, boo that pow, ooh ow I need a cigarette now!
Everything is on fire
Please stand up I'm like a head trip to listen to
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
I was the one who they would blame it on
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Faggot, you think I'm scared of you? You gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
No you ain't, come back
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now I don't really know where I'm headed
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
I hang around big stars all day,
I went from having my city locked up
One without a cause
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
Now bleed! bitch bleed!
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You loved him didn't you?
And take off their underpants, my salsa
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
What's the matter dog?
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit
And Wink did fuck my girl
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind It must be the ganja
You got any shrooms?
Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost
This free world's got you gassed up
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
All I know is when I get there
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, they don't know what dope is
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
And try to get money out the drawer
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
thats why i didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
Thought I had the Midas touch
But Shady's cute
Well tell her to shut her mouth, then I'll leave her alone
I love my daughter more than life n' itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
left to his plane and he missed it
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
(I can't I'm scared)
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
Just sit there in one fuckin' place spinnin' in
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
Man I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
All the way to the parking lot, fellow
It's no secret
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
but i'll probably still be the man when everything is over
Cause there's a puppet on my hand The way you shake it, I can't believe it
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
I ain't never seen her butt like that
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Guts over fear, (The time is here)
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
I'm sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat
But I promise momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
I'm like "niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too"
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,
Find the light, find the light, find the light So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
I have no snare in my headphones
I never meant to hurt you
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no
My head is swollen, my confidence is up
You were supposed to love me
(Swift, chill)
Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissy face, please
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
To seize everything you ever wanted
Oh God my brain is racing
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
I am a movie, camera block
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me
Leave hand prints all across you
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
In the end I'm gone
Shady brothers, ladies love us
Baby, get down, get down Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
You do know but actin' like you don't know Now homie I say I run (it run) it 'cause I'm in control
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
Fat girls
So I can't cum in her, fucks like a porn star, looks like Jenna,
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
No love lost,
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Ever since I came along
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
Bumpin' 'Ice, Ice, Baby', screamin' Shady 'til I die
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Psych! I joke, I joke! I keed, I keed!
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs
My drinks is 10 around
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
Let me know when it occurs to you
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
You hear me? Answer me! Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down We don't bullshit, better ask around
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
Up the center of the dance floor
"Daddy where's mommy?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But my grace and loose tooths
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go I'm getting by with my wicked ways
And I don't know if no one knows it
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it
but those days are gone [EMINEM] Alright,
All the wars that are fought
One slug
This bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
Caught in a change
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
I've been talking to God like that's my therapist
I don't know it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of being admired
bring me back to life, bring me back to life,
Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
Lets let our love unfurl
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this Nicki Minaj but I wanna stick
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Cursed and blessed
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
get it back, give it back ain't 'bout shit
Come on!
And I don't mean rap
It was bologna was it the Methadone ya think
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
I fell for this so many times
Jessica Simpson sing the chorus, Jessica Simpson When you walked through the door
The further you put it behind ya
Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
White girls
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Through the passage of time
"Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head" If you could count the skeletons in my closet
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Legacy, legacy I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
there aint no way that you'll win
And they blame it on Marilyn
I act like shit don't phase me
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Or come to grips, with the fact that
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
Second base? What the fuck you tell Nick, punk?
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
Twenty million other white rappers emerged
And it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me And I am, whatever you say I am
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
(C'mon)
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha) Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess Have you ever loved someone so much
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
School flunkie, pill junky
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I'm right back on 'em, with the
Someone help me I think my face is melting
at least that's what her train of thought is
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both
Ain't changing my mind
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
I got the same exact tat
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,
patron top wash straight from the liquor store
In order for me to pick that mic back up
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
And I don't mean apartment
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
fuck it you can take the mic home with you
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
'Cause you're my mama I guess we are who we are
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
Fuck I was born during a earthquake To all the weed that I've smoked
Let's cash that one in
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
In the video with the goatee?
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Drugs kill, bitch I'm for real
So let me just revel and bask
Its unfortunate but its Too late for the other side
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? Now this looks like a job for me
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
I crack your shoulder-blades
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
Run out of excuses with every word
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Find the light, find the light, find the light Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned And I am, whatever you say I am
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
Sing it with me, just for today,
If I could just get over this hump
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
Now everyone report to the dance floor
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
Blend in with the rest of the room
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now, ain't you momma?
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin') Let's pretend like its '98
I know everything he's got to say against me
I'm an MC still as honest
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I'm about to lose my mind
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith
Hope so, now ho Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berserk) all night long
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
'Cause it feels so empty without me Kids! Lately I've been hard to reach
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know
And I just do not got the patience
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
I'm a hustler, I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
Believe me I'm leavin' a carcus today
It's not so bad My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Ha ha ha, I'm just playin' ladies
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I call the play, now do you see why?
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Fuck you! Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you A lot of people ask me
And why I just don't know So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
Lookin out, cause I'm standing in the flames
In the night sky
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
So i'm a german eh?
Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
If you ain't been through nothing
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt! This is survival of the fittest
I'm lookin for a girl
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
yeah they call me rabbit this is the turtle race
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm I'm so bad
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
and have you lookin foolish like Chedder Bob when he shot himself
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc
That was never my object for someone to get killed
But its real and cats is gettin' killed
Almost gave up, I was like "Fuck it"
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
Only time I ever been out and about is
Even angels have their wicked schemes
But then I got a little bit older
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that
Unless you're a swallow
Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
Okay, I'm ready to go play
Nigga on and on till the break of what
fuck lotto call me your leader
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
A sky full of lighters Obie Trice
I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
Big pills, mescaline
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Or just let it slip? Yo
Boy's like how vanilla ice gonna diss you
Don't touch what you can't grab
So I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
What you crying about?
Pee in a tea-cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
It's like the greatest gift you can get
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so
I don't need no fucking manservant
In your living room, ha-ha
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
(You're crazy) I pop four E's at one time
I can't wait, I'm going back! Ha ha woo! Dr. Dre, 2020, yeah Ladies and gentlemen
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream,
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Hold up, she misunderstood me
yellow nigga, no cabs
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man [Chorus - Rihanna]
and it wasnt time to move and schools werent changing again
Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
Look real close cause strobe lights lie We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
You do know but actin' like you don't know Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
But wounds, wounds heal
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
You do know but actin' like you don't know You know, you actin' like you don't know
There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
They call me Superman
You got somethin' to say?!
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
A poster child
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like
What's goin' on?
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience That's nonsense!
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Oh gee, is that supposed to be me
Watchin' me while I write this like
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
I think I want you too
Forced trauma, blunt
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Won't get out? I'll push you out
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,
(Grady!) Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
I'm tired of all you
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef You better kill me! I'm a be another rapper dead
It's just us, nobody else!
Never stopping like we hypnotized
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
Shove it up my butt,
Thinking he can try and solve them
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise Slim Shady and Brown Trucker, another bunch of mother fuckers
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers Lickilty Split freestyle: Check this out, Check this out, yo
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
Three to the one from the one to the three
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
man they treat me like a legend
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
I've been too long on my own
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
I can barely decide
You're trying to save me
But thank you for staying April, I'm a make you learn
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Take another shot of Jagger, shake it so nervously
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)
I wrote it on the Starter cap
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
And although one has met their grandma
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
This bitch don't know what abortion is
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
And in the front drive talking to myself
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
But you'll always be my hero
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth [Chorus] It's Friday night came to this bitch right
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
Now it's blue blood in my veins
So here I go is my shot
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
Come on we're going for a ride bitch
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had Hi! My name is (what?)
I saw your headlights as I looked back
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
But on eggshells I was made to walk
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
Shady's back
'Round the outside, 'round the outside Guess who's back, back again
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
In front of cameras too (brrr)
I say everyday she be givin it up [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Connected to a higher power
But I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
And Dr Dre said
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
Yeah
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud
(Don't leave me!)
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
and don't come back until something dope hits you
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
That you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Who you think helped mold 'em all
{Eminem]
F-A-C-K, F-A-C-K, fack, fack fack fackin' freak me!
you think these bitches gonna feel the shit you say
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
The way I knock em outta they shoes
It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
And the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in
Slim Shady Hi! My name is (huh?)
I'll slap you off that bar stool
Rock from Soho to Arizona
You don't wanna become another victim
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Back again
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Now my respect I demand it
When I drive by six people
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so Lately I've been hard to reach
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Little punk!
Uh, it's time to raise it, then
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Geez, I just got my seat!
Fuck a clock
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Hey yo Em
And as you say goodbye to the grief
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And make that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
Young, dumb and fulla cum
If she don't stick to the script, then I'mma just keep goin'
Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Something, something, something, something, I dunno Pop pills, pills I pop
Silly rabbit i know why they call you dat like you follow future
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
Ya'll are doomed
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
