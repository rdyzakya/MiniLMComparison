But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
I know I'm wrong, yeahI'm a problem
I smell a massacre
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
(I can feel it)
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse
I wish my trailer would, tell me what I overate
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
In a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
I will feel your pain
Get on downGet on down
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
Can we get much higher? So high
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Also, I'm also awesome, also
If you wanna make it number one your number two now
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
Now we finna lose all self control
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
And every moment controlling me
Hold up, hold up
Every night (All of the lights)Turn up the lights in here, baby
They see a black man with a white woman
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Let the sun come out and all the children sayI woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
My by any means on
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
High lights
I know you're happy, 'cause I can see it
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
Driving fast, lost control
And even though I always fuck my life up
Now everybody is movin' they body
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Faster
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
'Member I'm coming back
I know you can't believe
We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
I wanna see everyone's hands in the air like this
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me)
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
You know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!
(Oh oh you mad, huh?)
Now throw your hands up in the skyI'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
Uh, y'all pay the price, I pay the difference, it's just different
In a French-ass restaurant
Cause I already know how this thing go
Haters give me them salty looks, Lowry's
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
Something about Mary, she gone off that Molly
You should be honored by my lateness
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
How did you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
And I...[Hook: The Weeknd]
Die high blood pressure
Can we get much higher?
We just sold out all the floor seats[Chorus: Estelle]
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up In
This is my part nobody else speak
So I can sayHello my only one, just like the mornin' sun
(21st century schizoid man)The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
I know, I know, I shouldn't even bother
You haven't
I got a hope, I got a chance
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)Now this would be a beautiful death
At least you know that's what I'm good atAnd I always find
God I'm willing
But when I get my card back activated
At that moment I dispersedGet low, alright
You throw your motherfucking hands in the air
We know we need
You're way too hot for them to handle you
I mean I fuck with your friends but damn Gina
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?

We the new Jackson's and momma 'bout that action
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full

'Cause you could blame me for everything

Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
Bumping r&b;, and I got the leaf, on the 23's

Lead me into the lightKiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Yeah, I'm talking bossy, I ain't talking Kelis

It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
Ashford & Simpson
Just kids, no parents
I heard the beat the same raps that give the track pain
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
Early morning cartoon shit
Al Green
And I'll be taking all the stacks[Verse 2: Desiigner]

Niggas ain't real as they pretend to beLookin' for all my real friends

A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis

Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
But I still drove 30 hours
Anything but us is who we are
You might think you've peeped the scene
Before I had a house and I'd do it again

I will field their questions
Come on homie what happened
Besides Ye they can't stand besides me
All these fancy things

Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire 
And this is for the family that can't be with us
I'm trying watch my sodium
Baby please,

Wood floors in the new apartment
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Deliver us serenity
Driving in the same uh that they killed Pac in
And all our eyes green it only means one thing
Love! I don't get enough of it
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe

To know some, if we both honest
And if they hate then let 'em hate
I feel it
New Gospel homey - take 6. And take this, hatersN-now th-that that don't kill me
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards upGossip gossip

Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
(Oh oh you mad, huh?)Oh oh, she gon' be mad right? Ain't that too bad, right?
Crazy
Treat the demons just like Pam
Money turn your kin into an enemy
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'd be worried if they said nothing
I'm not sure anymore-more
Even though everyone said that I had to make a switch
Be it Yellow Fin or Bass or them trout in Vermont
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
So I got something new to see
I guess I should've forgot where I came fromLa la la la
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
That's why I'd rather take the 405
(Jesus Walks with me)
Whoa, make the ground move, that's an ass'quake
Yes it will, yes it will (Well well well well)
Ja make them so sunny and true 
But I still talk that CA-A-ASH,

You don't need me to ever write
And so far, no cigar
Of our imagination, MTV cribs Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives

Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
Then the sky filled with heroines
So y'all better quit playing with GodSoon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Only way I can sum it up, son of a bitch(Hands up, hands up)

Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
Single black female addicted to retail and wellOh when it all, it all falls down
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
To real friends, to the real end

If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused

You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
She ain't really bad, she a photo thot
Shoppin' for the winter, and it's just May, nigga
We erased one another
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me 
You probably find one of them "I like art" type girls

Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
I need you right now
Hey, I'm goodWelcome to the good life
Sneaker's looking Fresh to Death I'm lovin those Shell Toes.

If you fucking with this girl then you betta be payed
Rain, rain, rain go away
Hitting off licks in the bando
But they just not you" and I just got through
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit
Late for the class, in the hallway, nigga
But I am a close high
Taking all the stacks, ohI got broads in Atlanta twisting dope, lean, and sipping Fanta
Holding on to what I believe inNo matter what
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
Hold on I'm tryna get loose, please don't get shit confused
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
And look at all that he gave you
Man, they kneeling when I'm walking in the building
I just wanted you to knowI be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
Like a flight with no visa
You know why
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
From the moments of pain
Lets play the blame gameI love you, more
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
[Intro]

Tell your P.O. how-how long you been high? All day, nigga
And she got the goods
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?

If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's bests
Who's provoking you?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
Maybe we can start again 
Nothing unwantedJust want to feel liberated, I, I, I
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (else, else, else)
Friday night tryna make it into the city

Good morningGood morning
Credit cards and the scanners
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong

Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
Why would you ever listen to
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Letting everything goYou got the power to let power go?
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body
For my children
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
What if we fuck right now?
Fire up, tweaking
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday

When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound, believe believe believe believe! 
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
What if we fucked right in the middle
I'll be more supportive
You're not like the others
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie

Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Fresh air, rolling down the window

For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Even for my...Real friends
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
Pink wig thick ass give 'em whip lash
Somewhere I can feel safe
Wake up like everyday new to you
Pray for the parents
Lil Boosie with the white now
Hurry up with my damn croissants
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
See I had to go, I had to move
Acting straight but then going out to the gay fish clubs
(How do I find you?) 
So if the devil wear prada, Adam, Eve wear nada
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now 
Bought more jewelry, More Louis V.
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
I'm living the future so the presence is my past
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
Everything, everything

(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen

Maybe we can start againBut if you really cared for her
You open my eyes
Get stacks, drive cars
There's been an accident like GEICO
I'm the villain, no really I'm just chillin'
I'm the only thing I'm afraid ofNo matter what
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
Runaway from me baby

And I know that you'll take good care of your child
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Who do you turn to?
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Got the food in Islam and the trenches hah?
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
But I been talking to God for so long and if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Whole thing, whole thing, whole thingOh my God

Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is
Cop a Prada spacesuit about the stars
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
Man I've been waiting all night now
(I wish a nigga would)
Ooh
[Kanye West]

One thing you can't do it stop us now
Forget barbie fuck Nicki she's fake
OK first things first I'll eat your brains
Young and we alive, whoo!
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'd like to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
You already know I'm straight from the Chi, all day, nigga
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
Baby don't get too loud, loud
20 Gs for the Yeezy's off of eBay
As kids we used to laugh
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Would you be my love, my love.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohLook like a fat booty Celine Dion
I been feeling all I'm giving
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bedRain, rain, rain go away
Order, huh
Reality is catchin' up with me
But we still hood famous
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
If I part my heart will live through you
I could never take the intimacy
Been a long time since I spoke to you
Let's call out names, names, for sureOn a bathroom wall I wrote
As far as my business
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
When I pulled up to the light
Tell me what's next, aliens have sex
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
No matter how much of a thug you see
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupeOh when it all, it all falls down
Real friends, how many of us!?
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
I feel it[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Let's play the blame game for sure
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy, your chick, she so thirsty
Like Martin with no Gina
I pullin up stuff in the Phantom ship
Stun me with your lasers
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
When time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
A country girl that love Hollywood
They don't know what we been through
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
And you know it, and you know itSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
Me found bravery in my bravado
You cannot mess with the light
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
You already know that I'm straight from the Chi, all day, nigga
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
I was splurging' on trizz
Ever be solvedAnd no matter what
Have you seen her

And wave your body, body, you can get the fuck off this campus
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Dancing with the Marlins making out with the all the Snappers
I gotta live, I gotta love
Black out the room, bitch
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin'
Murder murder in black convertibles
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
And I, and I love it
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
It's grind day, from Friday, to next Friday
No to X rated

Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
Pussy stays on my mind
Stay true to you, a hood musical
I'mma disrobe you, than I'mma probe you
I don't let 'em play with me
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
I'm in that two seat Lambo' with your girl, she tryna jerk meDrop it to the floor, make that ass shake
All the faces that I know
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
It's amazing
Know that motherfucker well, what you gon' do now
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
I swear I've been on this flight like a month right now
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound, believe believe!Okay, Lamborghini Mercy, your chick, she so thirsty
Never know enough, til it's over love
That's our costra nostra
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
From a very far away place
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
So can you understand? One day you'll understandSo hear me out, hear me out
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
Lochness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
An I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Set the party, really set the party off right
Everything we dreamed of

Will you be my American Boy? American Boy.Can we get away this weekend.
Act like you can't tell who made this

Walkin that walk.
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight

To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy

Would everybody stop buggin'? they don't want nothin'
Fuckin' with a real ass nigga

(I feel it's fadin')[Outro]
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
I can, I can sing it, yeahI need you right now
On the field I'm over reckless, on my Odell Beckham
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
Remind me where I know you from?
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
Invites to all my niggas, impregnate Bridget
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this

Look at this P Coat, tell me he's broke.And I know you ain't into all that,
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
Nothing unwantedI just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
Of my memory's museum
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
Selling bar, candy
Only problem is I'm rich
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
I've been so damn gone
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha
Even if the money low, can't pay me
It is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth
But how many honest? Trust issues
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
Homie, this shit is basic
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Baby we living in the moment

Cause I'm coming home againMaybe you, do you remember when?
And still be addicted to them hood rats
This is God dream
Told him I've been on ten since the 10th grade, nigga
Oh, how could you be so heartless? 
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
And I drove back 30 hours
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
No questions, no questions please, just on your knees
So mommy best advice is to get on top of this
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
And all this (well well well well)

Treasure, what's you pleasure?
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga
Never gave up
So you walk around like you don't know me
Only I can mention me[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Whole buncha lot of shit
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
But if she bad I might hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)Holy, powers, Austin, Powers
He deserves an applauseSo amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' 
Whole world on my dick
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
Sophomore three years aint picked a career

Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody
South, south, south side! All day, niggaI could do this all day, boy, I'm finna turn this bitch out
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in
No more parties in L.A
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
And if I'm fake I ain't notice cause my money ain't!
How could you be so heartless?
Can't let them get to me
The drama, people suing me
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
The coldest story ever told
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
Everybody knows (I'm a motherfucking monster)
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
I heard you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Till about 2 A.M. and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
(Jesus Walks)
In what what he dreamed

And my eyes more red than the devil is
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh...If young Metro don't trust you I'mma shoot youBeautiful morning, give me some in morning baby
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold

I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I'm just gonna say good nightI'm not sure anymore-more
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
People still gettin' popped on the day to day
Let's call out names, names, for sureI can't love you this much
After that, give you something to drink

Ain't nobody watchin'
Let me know if it's a problem then

And then they say (hey) and then they say
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect

Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
We don't want no devils in the house...
Bust a nigga head and then I lay low
Goddamn, Goddamn! Who thought you how to get sexy for a nigga?
So why send depression not blessings?
You borrow our motto
Like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking.
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
Get down girl go headEighteen years, eighteen years
Let the sun come out and all the children say

Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
I'll show you to my bridrens.
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
F*ck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion

No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed

They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
Asking me why the hell I text in code
You persecute the weak
That's how long I been on ya
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong
Tell 'em, "Give me fifty million now or I'mma quit"
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
She has no idea what she's doing in college
Where the eyelids go[Verse 1]
No more (Los Angeles)[Outro: Junie Morrison]
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
(21st century schizoid man) 
Cause baby, you're awesome
We want prenup!, yeah

I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Baby, I got a plan
Don't let nobody bring you downYou're so awesome
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog

Jumping out the window

Claiming I'm overreacting
Dream beautiful and unusual
Beautiful morning, give me some in morning baby
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitchFour in the morning, and I'm zoning
On an ultra light beam

Alright, alright, alright
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
I can't love you this much
Always turn [?][Outro]
I laugh in my head
But when we get together be electric slidin'
I feel it's fadin'
They say that they don't see what you see in me
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
'Til I hit the bartender with the bars-tool
They it sound all wack and corny
(Yeah, now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fish
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
But you never thought that I would take it this far
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
Infect me with your loving
The best living or dead hands down huh?
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Don't act like I never told yaN-now th-that that don't kill me
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
God damn Yeezy how I hit 'em with a new style
Get down girl go head get down
After all these long-ass verses
I wake up, assessin' the damages
I don't even want to talk about it
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
Uh, Good morningWake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh
(Yeezy taught me)
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
Uh, 21 Grammies superstar family
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow
And I'll say bride of Chucky is Child's play
My presence is a present kiss my assGossip gossip
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
I don't know what it is with females
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh
You call down for an omelet
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
My leather black jeans on
And I'm ready to go
I was high when I met high
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
Give up the women
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Hope you killas understand me[Bridge: Kanye West]
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datson
You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
Wake up, Mr West
Strive for victory
Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see (Ain't nobody fucking with my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique)Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Some want you dead, ayAll day niggaI took a deep sweet breath, and I reached into my head
Revealing the layers to my soul[Hook: The Weeknd]
Hide 'til its bright out
Hatred and attitude tear us entirelyLet's play the blame game, I love you, more
Runaway
I'm tryna bathe my eyy, eyy, in your Milky Way
We've become public enemies
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let me tell you, I'm out here
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
I made that bitch famous
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished girl
Pockets swole, Danny

Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you sayHello my only one, remember who you are
The good life, let's go on a living' spree
You a fake Denzel like the Allstate nigga
Im about that Farrakhan
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
You motherfuckers living like half of your level, half of your life
Wanna be a victim
Detroit wear cleaned up
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Cause I'm coming home againI met this girl when I was 3 years old
She walking around looking like Micheal with ya money
Here come some conservative Baptists
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
Ride around listening to Sade, nigga
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
Arguin' with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
Why? They mad they ain't famous
I'm tryna keep my faithFather this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
You want a boss or an R&B; nigga with a six pack?
The plan was to drink until the pain over
Like where was you last week? My nigga the fuck was you hidin'?
Where the eyelids...

So we gonna do everything that Kan like
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful

That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothingLet the champagne splash
No, I can't love you this much
I've been a menace for the longest
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!

Only I can mention me 
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Yeah Estelle we about to get down
My dick out, can she suck it right now?
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
I threw suicides on the private jet
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Every move is magicYou're from a whole other world
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
See before I let you go, one last thing I need to let you know
I was in there like ooh shit I never been here before
You should go and get your ownUnemployment line, credit card declined
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Cause I'm coming home again

Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
Niggas just stop it
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
I need you right nowI miss the old Kanye, shit from the gold Kanye
My mama couldn't get through to me
Run away fast as you canShe find pictures in my email

Hotter than a middle eastern climate
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
It take too much to touch her
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
You don't need to listen to your manager
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish lineSo keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
I know this world is changin'Never gave in
The problem is I be textin'
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)

And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
Let me run to see who came undone
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie

If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
For everyone who feels they said they've said sorry too many times
But way less effort, cause when you try hard
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do: just not new
Ribena, I know what you're drinkin,
Telling her her son's on life support?
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
And I'mma need you now

Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
I'm in that two seat Lambo' with your girl, she tryna jerk me
Why you frontin' on meCause I'd rather do nothing with you
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
I am a GodI just talked to Jesus
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
M.J. gone, our nigga dead!
All his cash, market crashed
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university (All of the lights)Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights

They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Can only make me stronger
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
How many real friends?
I need you right now, I need you right now
'Cause all my clothes designer.Dressed smart like a London Bloke.
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Just throw this at the end and fuckin' wait for the April
To whom much is given, much is tested
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole
You can feel the lyrics and spirit coming in braille
Ja make them so sunny and trueI'm not sure anymore-more
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey) 
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
Now all I know I know all these thingsThis is family business
Hurry up with my damn ménage
How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga
Who is knocking at my door-door
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
I would've been blacked out on your assGod, God, God, God!
I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits. First let's see the west end.
You went to bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted
So to hell with all that rubbish[Estelle:]
Except he's really putting it down?
People saying, "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
Pacing, thinking, to myself
Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin'
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down 
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-your-face level
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
That major that she majored in don't make no money
I'm a killer
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordan's (2 Chainz!)OK, now ketchup to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'mma feel like an asshole
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
It's time to get the paperI've been outta my mind a long time
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Where the eyelids go 
(And niggas still hatin') So much hate I need an AK
If you ask, lost my soul
Yeah I'm talking LeBron, we ball in our family tree
Bet they give me a pound.
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
Okay, Lamborghini Mercy (swerve), your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
Met her at a beauty salon
And from that point I never blow her off
Nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since second grade
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
Blow, don't sneeze, bitch shut up, don't breathe
I'm bill droppin', Ms. Pacman, this pill popping-ass, ho!
Tell them put the money in my hand right now.
I'm good 
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Well let this take away from my spins
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Run away fast as you canRunaway from me baby
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Public visitation
See I abducted you, so I tell ya what to do[Katy Perry]
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us
That digs on meNow I ain't saying she a gold digger
And there's no one else I know who can take your place[Hook: Kanye West]
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
Your love is fadin'Know it ain't no wrong
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
We only making the highlights
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And you thought he was cute before,
And I dont mean that in no nice wayGot the lil kids singing about the shit now the jokes on you
And no I ain't been to MIA
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2 
Let me run 'til you're off my case
Yeah, you wasn't mine though[Hook]
Nowhere seems to be too far[Hook: Kanye West]
Man why can't life always be this easy
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Ready for abductionBoy, you're an alien
While I hop in the Delorean
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
People trying to hate on you
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hanging off the Eiffel
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit
Tell mama that I only want [?] mineOne life, one night
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass'tray
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
All right, all right, I admit it
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's
I am a God
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Don't make me pull the toys
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
I know that Jesus died for us
You'll be my American. American Boy.La da da di da (4x)
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogantYeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
Fuck arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Buy any jeans necessary
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Getting stupid ass straight about the charge
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouthBound to fall in love
When i say I've got crabs I mean it literally
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
South, south, south side, all day niggaWell, well, well
I remember! Twista had this on in The Source
Eighteen years, eighteen years
All for a chance to be a star
And that girl ain't even religious
Hallelujah
Name one genius that ain't crazy
You say, "I'm good" then great, next day they ask you for somethin'
If I knew what I knew in the past
Please (shake that body, party that body)[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Tryna send photos of familia
And I know they love it.
I guess I get what I deserved on 'em
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out(Jesus Walks)
Momma pass in Hollywood
Now look at what you just saw I think this is what you live for
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
My whole life in the hands of God
Dirt and grime and filth inside
I hope you ready for tonight
I just wanted you to know 
You're so hypnotizing
I've been runnin' 'round
Specially on my Pastel, on my Bape shit
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me
I close my eyes and imagine, the good lifeIs the good life better than the life I live
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
Might not come when you want but I'm on timeAyy, y'all heard about the good news?
I always act a fool oww oww, ain't nothing new now now.He crazy, I know what ya thinkin,
You're my freak dreams
Your kiss is cosmic
Are you gonna be? Say that you're gonna be
Cause you will never get on top off this
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
Who the hottest in the world right now.
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
And when you smile, I will smile
How you feelin', how you feelin, how you feelin' in this mother fucker, god damn
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
Cause baby you're awesome
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman (sonic boom!)Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
How many?
Yeah, I'm talking B', nigga, I'm talking me
