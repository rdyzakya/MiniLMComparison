She had hair so long that it looked like weave
But my features and my shows ten times your pay
Bam bam, bam bam
I'ma shift the paradigm
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
Hey, you remember where we first met?
(And the fires did declare us)
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
From the very start
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
Yeah my money's so tall that my barbies gotta climb it
Want you to see everything
Who her? I forgot her nameOoh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
All my broads is foreign (foreign) money tall like Jordan!Okay, Lamborghini Mercy (swerve), your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
Zip it listen!Can we get much higher?
Far as girls you got a flock
Dressed in all your fancy clothes.
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get ass a lot[Katy Perry]
You can't be still
I hold my head
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
What do I know? Flashing lights, lightsI know it's been a while
You know what I need
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
Well gather round children
Don't act like I never told ya 
I think big get cash make 'em blink fast
From running through my mind
I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Reluctantly, 'cause most of this press don't f**k with me.Estelle once said to me, cool down down, don't act a fool now now,
Know it ain't no wrong
Trying to stack these millions"
It was more like spoken word
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
Living the life 'til I dieI bet me and Ray J would be friends
Your touch so foreign
It's something that you need to have
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothingLet up the suicide doors
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Pray for the parentsI'm tryna keep my faith
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off fumes
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So I could play that shit back in, slo-mo
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You're so after dark
So I'll just say good night to you
If you ain't with us, you in our way, nigga
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
Could you be the devil
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Nobody else had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this every day-day? (Huh!)
We want the lord, he's sick
Them niggas ain't doing shit
And when you cry, I will cry
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
Split and go where?
Don't act like I never told yaYou know how long I've been on ya?
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
It's supernatural
Deep, deep, down inside
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
God damn
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Now she claiming I bruise her esophagus
For my theme song
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
Young and Restless
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
My reign is as far as your eyes can seeIt's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
In the frozen fish aisle feelin' like a whore
Gave him what I had left
Can I come inside?
Courts suck me dry
I saw this, I saw it
Grandma, get 'em shook up
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
Every one of them that I know
Swizz told me let the beat rockFor all my Southside niggas that know me best
Step into the fantasy
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!)
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Wanna feel your powers
'As I lay me down to sleep
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
We going all the way this time (Time)
You'll never find nobody better than meIn the night, I hear 'em talk
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
She get under your skin if you-uh
Uh, they better watch what they say to me
They don't mean a thing, a thingAnd I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
We walk away like strangers in the street
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
We bout to get this paperPablo bought a Roley and a rottweiler
Can you bring your price down?
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
So ya never know, never never know
I'm in between, but way more fresher
Where the eyelids go
I hear her speak to meHello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
Who thought you how to put some Jimmy Choos on?
I slapped that Holland ass, make that Grouper butt shake
I just need to know[Bridge]
We going all the way this time
And what we need to do in the game
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed
Damn, these niggas got me
Riding down the 405, baby
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
You'll be my American BoyTake me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Any argument, the media'll extend it
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
Let the suicide doors up (Caw the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder)
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!I'm coming home again
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
Word in the streets is they ain't heard from him
I fantasized about this back in Chicago
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We don't want no devils in the house
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
Scary
Just to see how you was feelin'
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
I don't think he should
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
I been waiting for a minute
So I-I am headed home 
Yes darling
She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya money
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
OK get ya kids but then they got their friends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
On the hottest rap label around?
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
Monster Giuseppe heel that's the monster shoe
(You're the only power)
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
A-bay lately you been all on my brain
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)
Or here to convert atheists into believers
Less talk more head right now huh?
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
Let me see your middle finger in the air
But I never thought that you would take it this far
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
It seems we living the american dream
The concept of school seems so secure
I can tell by ya charm and ya arm
Ask Don C, I've been lit, this 'Ye shit just lit the fuse
Now I'm on fire, everybody go quiet (sshhh)
I'm living' in that 21st century
Good morningGood morningOn this day we become legendary
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohOhCan we get much higher? So high
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho!
No spoon
Fast life, drug life
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
So I-I am headed homeI-I crossed the limelight (the limelight)
I know a bar out in Mars
Huh?Real friends
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
We bout to get this paperMoney never made me
I'ma download that motherfucker I'ma shoot a bootlegger!
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
And after that night [?] play shit back, I don't know
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis
Talk that slick talk.
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
Ready-ready for actionFour in the morning, and I'm zoning
I'm liking this American Boy. American Boy.[Chorus:]
Just to ask you a question
Check the neck, check the wrist, them heads turnin', that's exorcist
From an eighth to a key
Uh, this that prom shit
[Kanye]
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
Lambo, Murcie-lago, she go wherever I go, wherever we go, we do it prontoOkay, Lamborghini Mercy (swerve), your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
The only rapper who compared to Michael
Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
Well! It is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth
Everybody fired up this eveningI'm exhausted
I'm also awesome 
I am a god
So awesomeYou look too good to be at work
Let's go shopping baby then we'll go to a Cafe.
Pray for Paris
Plus I already got one kid
I shoot the lights out
If one day you just up and leaveAnd I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
(Yeezy thought me)
And we just goin' be enemies
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind? (My mind, my mind, my mind)
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him 
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Shut down the whole party
Even when we was young I used to make time
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so longSo long
You're the only power that can, ohhhh
You never use to talk dirty, but now you you goddamn disgusting
That's when you die hard
While I'm smoking on a b dipping through the streets
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Will you be my American Boy? American Boy. 
Ugh, cause that left a script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
But I'm looking for more
But you stay right girl
Black X6, Phantom
How you feeling right now, let me see you ladies in the air
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
So, stick by his side
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
Tell the promoter we need more seats,
Look at the channel from '79We on an ultra light beam
I can tell by ya charm
And I'll be taking all the stacksI got broads in Atlanta
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit,
And watch the money pile up, the good lifeNow I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Bound to fall in love
I can feel it 
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy[Hook: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
Run away fast as you canTwenty four seven, three sixty five
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
How long it take you to get this fly? All day, nigga
I'm telling you oh, it all falls downMan I promise, I'm so self conscious
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!)
Motherfucker cant pull you across the stage KanyeWho told you, I told you to do something uplifting

I'ma need to see your fucking hands at theUh,
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
I know his dude's balling but yea that's nice
And I be sipping Hennessy, play some R&B;
At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like a corner store
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
And if you did, then that's family businessAnd I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
I keep it 300 like the Romans
But now I'm out and I'm free to love what I want
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
Why cant she just runaway
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said, "tru"
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
Now the whole party is melted like Dali
And end my holy war
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Before I lose half of what I own
See, I could have me a good girl
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You'll be my American Boy.He said " Hey Sista', it's really really nice to meet ya."
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well) 
With his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today
Ahh!Bitch I'm a monster no good blood sucker
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
Oh, how could you be so heartless?How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
This is a God dream
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Look at you, motheruckin' butt ass naked, with them, Jimmy Choos on
How these niggas so one-track minded
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
La di da da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
Take me to your hood.
I just need to knowDeep inside
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
I could just leave it wrong
Question what do all these things have in common
I bump my head
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (Yeah)
Which will probably take away from my ends
Couture from the store's department
Po' up, po' up
La la la la
Flashing lights, lights
I guess the money should've changed them
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
But why y'all washing watch him
And I keep a bad bitch on the passenger side, all day, nigga
Wait 'til I get my money right
Would you be my American Boy? American Boy.[Chorus:]
Every time that we hear them
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
Fill me with your poisonTake me, ta-ta-take me
So how the hell could you front on me?
How many runners do you got on call? All day, nigga
Haters sayin' ya changed
Do you think about me now and then?
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
At the end of it you know we both were wrongBut I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Remember how I'd say
What the hell was I supposed to do
Don't know why, but I know a sign when I see it 
Paparazzi like, "oh that's him!", pour that gin, let's get faded
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakesHey, hey, hey, hey
ExtraterrestrialExtraterrestrial
Beyond the truest
To the left, to the right

Under her underarm
And you know it, and you know itStop all that coon shit
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
Turn up the lights in here, baby
(Now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fishI used to be scared, denying who I was
The same problem my father had
Nothing unwanted
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Now that you're gone it hit us
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
And now she find out what life is really worth
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day (Huh!)
Oh she's a gold digger way over town
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
Follow our father
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast
(I'm a fish yo) Goin' on a gay fish
Enter the kingdom
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
That ain't right girl
Head of the class and she just want a swallow-ship
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
This the rap god shit nigga
They mad they're still nameless
To 3 A.M., callin'
You could leave or live wit' it
You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your lifeSomething wrong
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
I'm amazin'
You've been right in my face
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And yes, barely pass any and every class
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
I know, I know, I know when I see it
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
Back out the tomb bitch
Yeah we still hood famousI just wanted you to know
I feel it's fadin'[Verse 2: Post Malone]
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all

Her man in the store tryna try his best
(We did)
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
If i ain't on my grind
Run away fast as you can 
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
I've been so far gone
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
I think they finally think they got me where they want me at
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
And still will be in love wit meShe said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, IPerfect[Part 2]Up in the morning, miss you bad
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Who the fuck happened?
Ahh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
You're looking for something and I got it
You know what I need, want you to see everything
I got a problem with spending before I get it
Welcome to the danger zone
And there's no way to slow (down)
I'm tryna keep my faith[Kelly Price]
You could be the King but watch the Queen conquer
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
I spent that bread
Wait 'til I get my money rightI had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
Told you four times don't test me hoe
Twista had this shit on in The Source
The head still good though, the head still good though
Hands up, hands up and the cops shot usHold on, hold on, hold on
Off the road, jaw was broke
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I never fucked before
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
A different dimension
You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo! 
Would everybody stop buggin'?
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
And just imagine how my girl feel
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
This that goose an' Malibu I call it Maliboomyauh!
Timing of the underground, come and follow the trail
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me, now who with me?
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches, boundBound to fall in love
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
If you made plans or not
Wake up, nigga, wake up
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
Baby, not for nothing I know
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
HallelujahI'm tryna keep my faith
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Don't like his baggy jeans but I'm a like what's underneath it.
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Yeah, he might have hit it first
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
Huh?
Just touched down in London town.
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
I hate these niggas more than the NaziAs I recall, I know you love to show off
Might spend 50 racks on my off day, nigga
Walking, living, breathing, girl you know my past well
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
