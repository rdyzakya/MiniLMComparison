'Cause how could anything ever go wrong
Yeah, I had to get out of Texas, baby,
O talk to people more and go out more and, you know, your lifestyle's becomes more a come-out, flow-out thing instead of a hold-it-and-be-quiet type.
Later in the show.
That never learns to live When the night has been too lonely
Lord I'm leavin', yeah I'm leavin' this mornin'
All right, get it! Yeah!
When you told me that you love me I believed you, darling,
Can't solve at all Just when you feel like you can never win
Lord, I'm feelin' lowdown, just give me another glass of beer. What good can drinkin' do, what good can drinkin' do ?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Don't turn your face away from me, dear, oh you leave a lost girl
I never ran in a football game 200 yards
You told me that you love me I believed you, darling,
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby.
And the soul afraid of dyin'
"Honey, you can do anything,
Harry, please come home
When I say, I say tell me, come on man,
Come on up, because I've got to go
Honey, don't you understand my word ?
Oh man shit, man...
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, it just can't beNo it just can't be
Road block Yeah Try to block my road, daddy daddy daddy
Yeah ... Oh, the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird, and she warbles when she flies
I've got lots of things I've got to do. So long, my honey, so long.
That you think you can. But please don'tcha do it to me, babe, no!
What you need
A woman left lonely, she's the victim of her man, yes she is.
Well, I got my own trouble, I got my own car,
Did they make you different ?
Woke up an' found myself alone,
Use it, need it, want it, get it,
Ah baby, yes indeed. I said you, you're always gonna hurt me,
Lord, she learned a brand new game.
Like a carrot baby.
Whoaa ... yeah!!! You thought you had found yourself a good girl,
Oh! Easy rider don't you deny my name,
Who cannot seem to give
I'm standing here outside your door
But something is driving me, oh, back
For your love. I don't understand how come you're gone, man. I don't understand why half the world is still crying, man, when the other half of the world is still crying too, man, I can't get it together. i
Well alright, well alright. Well I guess I move once too often, babe,
Gonna sing at ya now. Do do do do do do do do do do do do do. Right now we're gonna do ... we wanna do a song right now, I hope no one hangs around, one more little song, it's all we gonna do, this is called "the farewell song" written by sam.
Yeah, but how do you, how do you tear a muscle singing, was it from the exhaustion or ...
About the times that I won't have to say So kiss me and smile for me
Lord, Lord, Lord! All is loneliness before me
And if you pay no attention darling
And you, it's only seed It's the heart, afraid of breaking
Yeah, yeah, comin' home, babe
Cause everybody came to me one time and said,
They don't exist on paper your songs, don't they ?
And I said I sit around and I'm a-wonderin'
Forget me down here, don't forget me, Lord
Someone to talk to you,
But you settled for a place right in my heart,
Anything I can do for you, baby. Tell your mama, babe!
Does this mean I have to hide to cry, cry all the time?
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.
Well, it's lookin' good and you're the one that's lovin' tonight,
But I wish he could see me crying today,
That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love, it is a hunger
'cause I know that it's my fault, dear.
You know it
I know it just can't be, darling, no no.
I felt apart from them.
You know, a couple of pairs of Levis and a couple T-shirts
That I didn't have. And I'll tell you what she had man,
Loneliness come worryin'
The way I loved you, baby,
The way I try to do ?
Say, good as you been babe,
Tell me why, sometimes darling
No, no, no, oh! You say you come from Texas, baby,
And when I wanna reach out my hand
Make up your mind, honey,
Oh no, oh no. Play it! Well, I got a horse and he lives in a tree,
I said now every day I've been searchin' babe,
Well, I went out searchin' for somethin', baby,
Always turns out the same.
But I drink it down, an' the next day I feel the same. Gimme whiskey, gimme bourbon, give me gin.
But nobody, nobody has to ever be so blind,
Ah maybe that man could help me
It's gonna feel just like those raindrops do
And that ain't the end of it, you know what I mean.
Honey, something's trying to hold on to me, to my way of life So don't You forget me down here, Lord, no, no, no
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Honey, welcome back home. I know she told you,
Whoa, call me mean or call me evil
Talkin' 'bout my baby,
I hope so.

Why the hell there ain't another way, oh! Women is losers

Oh, baby baby, well you drive me crazy
Hey hey, try to block my road
I may be seeing you around
Well no more, well no more,
You went away, had your chance to say,
I'm gonna walk and talk with jesus
Men always seem to end up on top anyway.
Hello, John, this is Janis
If she wants my man I'll just change my ways.
"I love you and I need you baby"
Carry no heavy load
Well I'm twenty-five years older now

'Cause if the jury convicts him, the judge will pay his bail.
You're not alone Ooh! Hey, hey, now!
Somebody talks as fine as he does
You need a sweet lovin' mama, babe. You need someone to listen to you,
Every time you get lonely sometime. Every time you got to cry, cry,
Said now, every morning I realize,
Lord, now you've heard my story, now you've heard my news.
I think that you know I did.
But I don't think you're gonna find anybody, not anybody
Baby, surrounding me
When you've got yours and I got mine.
Who'd make your life a bed of ease, ha ha ha ha!
That's the price that we both got to pay I gotta know, know that I'm ready, oh ready to settle down
But I don't understand why you always pick the time
I want the sky without the sun, now!

Ever since my daddy gone, yeah.
Help each other, honey, if you can
Please! Now, come back, babe, and believe my love,
Because it's got to be such a long, long way from cryin'
Oh honey, go on and sit right back down,
Fall for that old woman's story every time.
Makes a touchy situation when a good face come into your head.
Oh, I've been missin' you, babe! Yeah, and it all seems to bother me
I could use a little help sometime
Cause I ain't got you, that's all I've ever wanted,
Our love affair said it's just history, yes it is. And I tried to love you in my own way,
It's fantastic! I was across the river from the club last night, I never had more fun in my life! except sometimes in california I have more fun.
Oh to love anybody.

I'm gonna find me my man I say, get a pair of overalls.
And if you ever need a drink that should be on Sunday,
I'm not the kind of woman, no,
And the cotton, Lord,
And then she wilted from her loved one. And I see you looking up at the sky, how high it is, yeah.

With two pillows for my head.
And each time I tell myself that I, well I've just had enough,
Come, come, come on, come on, come on, and help me now.
Feels just like a ball,
Ha ha ha ha, you don't work too hard, baby!
To love anybody.
Which I want you to know is an effort on my part.
But you never ever, no you never ever,
Honey, what good could ever do
So if someone comes along,
Well I can mess around in that farm-yard.
And he never questions my reason why,
Oh honey, but I know better than that,
Don't try to take it!
The worst you can say all about me is that I'm never satisfied Use me Lord
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine. [Instrumental] Now when I go to work, I work all day,
When you wake up an' it doesn't feel right, man,
I say try, try yeah, oh try yeah,
Oh if I could pray and I try, dear
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
As good as you've been now, say,

Leaving on a Jetplane
