Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
That's what people say
Through the sorrow,
And I'm not just sprung
Fall in love
Oooo pretty lady don't you think it's crazy
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Because, because people aren't perfect and
Hold me tight and don't let go Baby, baby, baby, teach me, teach me, teach me
Tryna make it right Make it right
Yeah, I know that I let you down
In the fights
All I wanna do is lay down next you 'Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one love
My biggest weakness
I was doing nothing
Be alright All alone, in my room
That's only legal with a doctors note
Oh yeah What about the children?
Its in the papers, its on the TV,
Girl, I want ya
He gave you direction
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe
As long as you love, love me, love me [Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (now I'm all gone)
Won't have to drive too far
My mind never wakes up without you on it
I just want to love you and treat you right HOOK If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
This drink make me fall down
Hate or love was insane
All around the world (All around the world) You're crazy girl, crazy girl, you should know it
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
i'm all day with it man, a.m to the p.m
You're imperfectly perfect
So the moon is where I land
And I have no fear
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
If you got you today
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah
Wear it on your sleeve
Light it up, light it up, so explosive
Nothing left between us, baby Hopefully you'll give me a chance
Tell me what we got to fear
Oh I was starstruck
I'm better off alone?
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone
Chestnuts roastin' like a hot July
'Cause girl my heart's breaking
(Madly in love)
I'd always hoped for better
cause they might have me slipping, cause you're the only one
I thought you'd always be mine, mine I'm all gone
As long as you love me [Verse 1]
Been you If I would've known, if I would've known
I'm, I'm in love Ended up on a crossroad
Can someone tell how to make a change? I close my eyes and I can see a better day
Want me to leave, no [Chorus]
And every time I hold you near
It's my destiny I will never say never (I will fight)
Oh Whoa You know you love me, I know you care
Would you do the things that drive me crazy
How could you leave me
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? Oh Whoa
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To keep you forever.
My breath is your breath
My favorite, my favorite, my favorite
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go Alright, okay
(One and only)
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
But everything we had is stuck in the moment,
If I was your boyfriend
I will not stay on the ground
How many dinner dates set dinner plates and
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need
One time, one time
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
She like the price, she see the ice it make her coochie melt
Through the long nights,
Shouldn't have let you know
Now all I see is you
Cause baby
You, woah, oh, woah
There's gonna be one less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
Cause I need you to do it, baby
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight See I've made mistakes time after time, time, time
Go where you're going
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
All around the world (all around the world, people want to be loved)
And you can see the look on my face
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Mark my words, give you all I got
You're my special little lady
God sent us an angel to help us out
Hey girl, let me talk to you HOOK If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Ooh, my baby, baby, I'm begging, lady, lady
My one heart
'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey
But I still refuse to listen
From a thousand miles away When you smile
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause everything's gonna be alright,
Now I'm wishing you come back home but your not
Thought maybe together you and me find it
Ooh, it feels so right
World tour, it's mine, ten little letters, in a big sign
You're all that matters to me
We were best of friends since we were this high
Never thought I'd take you serious
Never say it, never, never say it I never thought that I could feel this power (aye)
Paradise
Full of beautiful instead of hollow
If this a lesson
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
You're the smile on my face
I let you in with all that I can
I close my eyes and I pray I pray
Ooh Everybody's laughing in my mind
Oh, oh, oh (this is ours baby, yeah)
I pray to God everyday,
I'm not afraid to tell ya
I'll show you Lately I've been thinking,thinking about what we had
And we're wondering how. Oh oh oh
This girls circus olay
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain? If I would've known, if I would've known

So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast car
I'm the only guy that you need
I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I still believe in us
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
(Pain or fear, pain or fear, no pain)
Okay though Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
The meaning of forgiveness
There's no way that I could share you
Bumps on the road and upside down
We gonna party like it's thirty twelve tonight
Just wanna have a conversation
Don't wanna lose no
I hope you believe in love
And your heart(is my heart) Your my one love
I know that you want me to,
Your world is my world
Oh across the ocean, across the sea
How can I let you go
You should go and love yourself But when you told me that you hated my friends
I'd tell the violins
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
'Cause girl my heart's breaking (heartbreaker) Hey girl
Bet they never felt the way we felt,
But did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
You ain't gotta make your mind up

I see it happening everyday, nothing lasts forever
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
and i'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe With you, shawty with you

(Going way up, way up)
All around the world people want to be loved

Then we gotta learn to trust right now Don't let this effort go to waste
So say hello to falsetto in three two swag PRE HOOK I'd like to be everything you want
All you gotta do is
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
When nothings going right
