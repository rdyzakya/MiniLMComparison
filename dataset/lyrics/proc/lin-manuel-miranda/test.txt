It's time to take a shot, time to take a shot
The world will never be the same, Alexander I am not throwing away my shot
When we saw your first letter arrive?
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
I'm searching and scanning for answers in every line
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
And I am not throwing away my shot
And he keeps winning anyway
Institutionalizing slavery only multiplies our troubles
I came from afar just to say bonsoir
Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
The next time we go toe to toe? Alexander, rumors only grow
Hamilton Sir Draft a statement of neutrality Did you forget Lafayette What Have you an ounce of regret
Dooo Hey (ohh, I do I do I do I)
Time What is it like in his shoes? Hamilton doesn't hesitate
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
Oh, who is this kid, what's he gonna do? How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in
You have to serve, you could continue to serve No, one last time
And the happy reward, as I trust
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Moved to kindness by my story
Once I get all this agreed upon, I'll pick up a pen
And we keep living anyway
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar? The ten-dollar founding father without a father
They don't get to know what I said
When I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
I've been readin' 'n writin'
To get your right hand man back Alexander Hamilton
Two weeks later
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I hope that you burn The issue on the table, France is on the verge of war with England
And do we provide aid and troops to our French allies
The hard won wisdom I have earned As far as the people are concerned
But he can keep all of Georgia
Destroyed my town
Slavery's a sin, it's growing like a cancer
I'm helpless
And? If we win our independence?
For just a moment
They'll surrender by early light
I panic for a second, thinking
I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
Who provided those funds France In return, they didn't ask for land
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
Ay, let 'em hear ya Let's go Whoa, whoa, whoa I said shout it to the rooftops
Yet in their hour of need, you forget Lafayette's a smart man, he'll be fine
Every single slave owner will demand compensation
You never learned to take your time Oh, Alexander Hamilton When America sings for you
Like the scripture says
My decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval
What is this? We have the check stubs, from separate accounts
Talk less What? Smile more Ha Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for You can't be serious You wanna get ahead? Yes Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead Yo yo yo yo yo
Are we a nation of states what's the state of our nation?
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
I'll reassure the South, 1808 is still the year
Helpless Oh, look at those eyes Look into your eyes
Imagine this debate with all of congress, it's ruinous
Relax, have a drink with me
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
He play and he raises the stakes And if there's a reason I'm still alive
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
I'm willing to wait for it
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
He exhibits no restraint
I am not throwing away my shot
View them with indulgence
In my sleep, seven feet ahead of me?
Wait for it
I'm 'a get a scholarship to King's College
I was louder than the crack in the bell
If we manage to get this right
We're gonna, rise up, rise up It's time to take a shot
And I'm drownin' in 'em In New York, you can be a new man
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance Hamilton You wanna fight for your land back? (Hamilton) I need my right hand man back (Hamilton) Ah, uh, get ya right hand man back (Hamilton)
First of all, sir, we won't involve you in this
And so the balance shifts We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
Unless Unless If I can prove that I never broke the law
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy And I am not throwing away my shot
With every word, I drop knowledge
Madison?
The world will never be the same, oh The ship is in the harbor now
The constitution clearly states
But my papers are orderly
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain Well, the word got around, they said, this kid is insane, man
And I got nervous, thinking what's she gonna do? (ooh)
Alex, you gotta fend for yourself He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf There would have been nothin' left to do for someone less astute
We were sick and she was holding me
And I'm drownin' in 'em Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
Only nineteen but my mind is older
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
Rise up
So there will be a revolution in this century
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Lose Hamilton's pace is relentless
But just you wait, just you wait When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
He's on the British side in Georgia
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from Ha you don't even know what you're asking me to confess Confess You have nothing, I don't have to tell you anything at all
Number four
Turns out we have a secret weapon
Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went?
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight Alexander Aaron Burr, sir Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature? Sure
