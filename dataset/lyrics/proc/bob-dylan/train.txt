I’m gonna establish my rule through civil war
With his wife and five children
You say you’re sorry
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law
So I came in here
To each his own, it’s all unknown
High water everywhere
She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
I can make it through
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
An’ a thousand miles behind
She wears an Egyptian ring
Suicide remarks are torn
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
I’m sittin’ at the welcome table, I’m so hungry I could eat a horse
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door
You say you told me
Heading out for the East Coast
			Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
Without your love I’d be nowhere at all
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
We just saw it from a different point of view
Oh, your love comes on so strong
I was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain
Don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed
In a pine box for all eternity
And you go watch the geek
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
But evidently she don’t
Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man
For them that think death’s honesty
I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train
Heading for the Gates of Eden
It was you who came right through
A world that just don’t exist
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
			Down the street the dogs are barkin’
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
If indeed there ever was a door										  
Next animal that he did meet
Then sends them out to the jungle
These ties are strong enough to bind
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds
As some warn victory, some downfall
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
I can live on rice and beans
That somebody thinks they really found you
I don’t want to straight-face you
And something inside of him died
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian and the Jew
You’ll be drenched to the bone
She said, “Lord, have mercy, honey
If you wanna learn anything
Deceived me into thinking
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Madams light the candles
I got a cravin’ love for blazing speed
While my conscience explodes
I hear your name
The cat’s in the well, leaves are starting to fall
She’s the brains behind pa
You know I love you and furthermore
Sure was gonna be rough
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile
I had to rearrange their faces
On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And the riot squad they’re restless
I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot
I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
You might as well keep going now
May you build a ladder to the stars
As if a wedding vow
I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind
When he built a fire on Main Street
When you wake up in the mornin’, baby, look inside your mirror
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
Going down in the valley and sing my song
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
And I’m tired of this bag of tricks
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
Even Jesus would never
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
Take a woman like your kind
It takes a thief to catch a thief
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
You may be a state trooper, you might be a young Turk
Where the executioner’s face is always well hidden
You said you’d never compromise
Too much paperwork
Just you and me
I’m so glad you’re my boy!”
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
Once more for a simple twist of fate
I shall be released
Before you call him a man?
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
She was born in spring, but I was born too late
Now all the authorities
For me t’ return t’ her chase
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They’re making a voyage to the sun
Or select you or dissect you
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
Then you set back and watch
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
You make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one
And the seas began to part
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Look out kid
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You lie and deceive
Your sons and your daughters
By the blood of the lamb
			Down over the window
			You got a lotta nerve
You know, I don’t mind him cheatin’ on me
Don’t block up the hall
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Settin’ my dial on the radio
Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence
The answer is blowin’ in the wind
“Have Mercy on His Soul”
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Well, they’ll stone you when you walk all alone
But you know you could be wrong
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine
And your gravity fails
Change my way of thinking, make myself a different set of rules
Was that some kind of joke?
After he took from you everything he could steal
Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
Bow down to her on Sunday
That a man can’t give his address out to bad company
When you go your way and I go mine										  
With the Memphis blues again										 
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling
In the brightness of my day
To see you										 
Well, you walk into the room
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
You’re in with
Alone you stand with nobody near
And I thought of me
I killed a man back there
Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
It’s the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
Now you're content to let the days go by
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
And it seems so unfair
But if you want me to
It's gonna be your own fault
To wear earphones
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
Abe says, “Man, you must be puttin’ me on”
Seem to be all that there is
As he bummed a cigarette
May your hands always be busy
But right now I’ll just sit here so contentedly
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy
At my window with a broken wing										 
Limited in sex, they dare
I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone
An’ pretend that we never have touched
I guess I should have known
The National Guard stands around his door
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
To those condemned to act accordingly
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
And I’m still in this all-night café
I'm traveling by land 
I can’t use it anymore
With the Memphis blues again
And the one I love so close at hand
Plants in the bed but
It can’t be this way ev’rywhere
And you’re so kind
If dogs run free
I’m a-wonderin’ if she remembers me at all
You just stood there grinning
I'm saying it plain
You got a lotta nerve
The stars are beginning to hide
As friends and other strangers
			Man gave names to all the animals
I could hold you for a million years
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls
They say prayer has the power to help
Every nook and cranny has it's tears
Them I will forget
’Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face?
Oh, though my friends forsake me
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
Because the cops don’t need you
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape
Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
All right, I’ll set you straight, can’t you see I’m a union man?
Nothing more than something they invest in
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
And your father to your sister he explains
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
The woman I'm lovin', she rules my heart
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
Of this I can’t say very much
He asks you how it feels
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
Darkness on the face of the deep
Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes
To the valley below										 
You may be the head of some big TV network
My fingers are all in a knot
There’s a woman by the river
My pulse is runnin’ through my palm–the sharp hills are rising from
On Independence Day
Just do what you think you should do
And everybody’s shouting
I see you there
She was married when we first met
And a gun that shoots
Lookin’ for a new friend
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
I know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind
As they rode him in custody down to the station
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,
Is, baby, be friends with you
Come mothers and fathers
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
Judge says to the High Sheriff,
Leave at your own chosen speed
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ’em
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I've already confessed – no need to confess again 
When the wind blows through the piney wood
Thank You, Lord
They’re lying low and they’re makin’ hay
Now the senator came down here
Lot of things they’d like they would never buy
(About the time the doorknob broke)
Seen a shooting star tonight
But by His mercy I’ve been spared
And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I was born here and I’ll die here against my will
Strap yourself
That you must be exactly like them
The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Abandoned it out West
No, I do not feel that good
Just like putting scissors to a string
God say, “You can do what you want Abe, but
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Someday you'll be glad to have me around
It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
When Ruthie says come see her
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door										 
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Well, six white horses that you did promise
You think I'm over the hill
Tomorrow will be 
And the day is a-gettin’ dark
Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn’t be seen by men
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And don’t criticize
The past was close behind
Cinderella, she seems so easy
God knows that when you see it
I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
Now I'm feeling the wall
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow
I wish she’d unlock
That runs down my drain
Why then don’t you show it
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
I had a woman down in Alabama
Oh, this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though
Reality has always had too many heads
They’ll stone you when you are set down in your grave
In the precious wind they rot
Tweedle-dee Dum, he’ll stab you where you stand
Tweedle-dee Dee—he’s on his hands and his knees
Like the ocean’s pounding roar
The lamppost stands with folded arms
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
Well, the road’s washed out—weather not fit for man or beast
Manipulator of crowds, you’re a dream twister
You just want to be on
Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear
And never sat once at the head of the table
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
You’d be honest with me if only you knew
But I see through your eyes
Nothin' but the moon and stars
That sparkles before she speaks
People talk of situations
By His truth I can be upright
I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all
Preacherman seeks the same, who’ll get there first is uncertain
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And fishermen hold flowers
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart
All good people are praying
Everything is broken
With my mind a million miles away
Yes, ’n’ how many deaths will it take till he knows
My sky would fall
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
I believe in you
And we all want what’s his
The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
Things should start to get interestin' right about now
The sources of this hidden pain
Got both eyes tight shut
Bring me my boots and shoes
And you say, “Impossible”
To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone
Noah’s great rainbow
This place ain’t doing me any good
Stand upright and be strong
But we’re gonna let it
In somebody’s room
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you										 
Is, baby, be friends with you										 
But I sure wish he’d take that off his head
Like a camel and then you frown
Well, I try my best
I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
Better jump down a manhole
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
From the west unto the east
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
I see, I see lovers in the meadow
Do you have any idea why or for who He died?
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
In harmony with the cosmic sea
You cast your spell and I went under
Flows out of their bodies
			Well you're comin' down High Street, walkin' in the sun
You have given me eyes to see
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
Slithering his way through the grass
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Hear the cracking of the whips
Like your mama and yourself
And while ev’rybody knelt to pray
Sometimes you can't give it away 
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
Draw conclusions on the wall
And there is no one there to dry your tears
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
I’m watchin’ the roads, I’m studying the dust
Like it’s your little toy
			Bye and bye, I’m breathin’ a lover’s sigh
She wears an iron vest
Why must I always be the thief?
I want to be with you any way I can
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives										 
The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him
My love she’s like some raven
Tangled up in blue
I left all my dreams and hopes
For Halloween give her a trumpet
And you’re thinkin’ of me
You’re gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance
All except inside the Gates of Eden
Distant ships sailing into the mist
There’s seven people dead
You just pick anyone
Sheiks walkin’ around like kings
Strapped to the mast
Like pendulums swinging on chains
			Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense
Yeah the road’s washed out—weather not fit for man or beast
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
I find it so difficult to leave
Got a hopped-up Mustang Ford
How I wish you were here to see 
She’s delicate and seems like the mirror
It’s tough out there
Last night ’cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
Who’ll pick you up each time you fall
You say I let you down
I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame
Don’t you understand
“Why must you even try?”
I need somethin’ strong to distract my mind
As she was walkin’ by the arcade
But you knew that we would meet again
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me
I take good care
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
I’m sittin’ on my watch so I can be on time
You could stand inside my shoes
Did they hear when He told Peter, “Peter, put up your sword”?
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Just drink up your blood like wine
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
And scratched your name in sand
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
An’ punched my cigarette”
They keep it all hid
Didn’t I rise above it all for you
There’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
Your babies are crying louder
But I know that he don’t talk
And were taking him away
But people don't live or die, people just float
You walk the floor and wonder why
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
Get dressed, get blessed
You might think he loves you for your money
She says, "look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants.
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
Nothing with you when you go
And how to throw the blade
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove
You can hear the school bell ring
Another best friend, somehow										 
Deny, defy or crucify you
I am not pleadin’ or sayin’, “I can’t forget”
They will lay you low
Yes, ’n’ how many seas must a white dove sail
Well, You’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
God knows it’s a crime
Are they lost or are they found
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Now at midnight all the agents
You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
For the wise men and the fools
See like me or be like me
Face full of black soot
We always did feel the same
Tailgates and substitutes
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal
She is good to me
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
On a bottle of wine
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Up and down the block
Shinin’ through the trees?
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I followed the winding stream
Though I’d never say
Well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding
			You may be an ambassador to England or France
All that and more and then some
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me ’til everything gets real
			Down along the cove
The country music station plays soft
“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
And they, they look at me and frown
When you went out to receive
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s makin’ me feel afraid
Every little detail
I’ll take you cross the river dear
Is tell me that it isn’t true
Oh! Lord! Just like mine!
I can hear their hearts a-beatin’
How all my fathers, they’ve gone down
Is a man who swears he’s not to blame
And the fire that burns in it
To get through to the man in me										 
To be seeing the real you at last
Ol’ Howard just pointed with his gun
			Close your eyes, close the door
To be such a freak?”
Can’t help but wonder what’s happenin’ to my companions
She seems too far out
The voice of praise
In the dime stores and bus stations
We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
It always does when you’re with me
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky
I’m paintin’ the town making my last go-round
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
And you’ll be fine at the end of the line
			When you’re lost in the rain in Juarez
Señor, señor, do you know where she is hidin’?
And tapestry of rhyme
Well the Lord created it, mister
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
You do good all day 
My senses have been stripped, my hands can’t feel to grip
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
But I’ll know my song well before I start singin’
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes
One summer’s day he came passing by
A perfect image of a priest
More of an outlaw than you ever were
And you just sittin’ there
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
Now the moon is almost hidden
To make you feel my love										 
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need 
Out in your face just for kicks
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’
I spied my little bundle of joy
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop
There’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry
You discover that you’d just be one more
You know my baby will
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
You that hide behind walls
Frighten you or tighten you
Statues made of matchsticks
I see your lover-man comin’—comin’ ’cross the barren field
I’m preachin’ the Word of God
And I was dying there of thirst
It only brings me sorrow
So darlin’, you better come through
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
Well, I’m leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
Broken threads, broken springs
Make promises by the hours
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait										 
Who immediately walks up to you
Its iron claws attached
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
Doesn't mean a thing to me
And you ask, “Is this where it is?”
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
If it’s information you want you can go get it from the police
Fighting in the captain’s tower
The man in the moon went home and the river went dry										 
You’d know what a drag it is
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
What good are you anyway, if you can’t stand up to some old businessman?
Who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die?
With a pain that stops and starts
Well don’t know which one is worse
But you know sometimes you lie
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
Advertising signs they con
Tell me that it isn’t true										 
If she’s passin’ back this way, I'm not that hard to find
“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
Her voice once an’ talk
I was thinkin’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me
Without any doubt
And you are on dry land
Thanks for the loan”
Through this weary world of woe
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t
The pangs of your sadness
There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
You were trying to break into another world
The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
When you know as well as me
The foreign sun, it squints upon
They whisper in the wings
That she’s the same one
But you know how hard you try
“Is it easy to forget?”
How many of his pals have been killed
If you’re havin’ a good time
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew
I loved you then and ever shall
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
But ev’rybody else, even yourself
I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
			We carried you in our arms
Somewhere in the distance
Come sit down on my knee
			Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
Then he started into dealing with slaves
I said, “That’s all right mama . . . you . . . you do what you gotta do”
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
I long to see you in the morning light
Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
I think it will fit me like a glove
Grandma said, “Boy, go and follow your heart
Hang around a ink well
Too serious to fool
“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”
That you’re holdin’ in your hand
I wish the night were here
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
I had something to protect
I am goin’ to teach peace to the conquered
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
You don’t have to be afraid
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
You can smell the pinewood burnin’
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
Where black is the color, where none is the number
They’d probably put my head in a guillotine
I’ve been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
All around you
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk
Casanova is just being punished for going
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
But soon hit the harder stuff
You will not die, it’s not poison”
And he says, “Here is your throat back
I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you
Watch the plain clothes
And the first one now will later be last
The phone’s tapped anyway
I wanna be with you in paradise
Fold my hands and pray for rain
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Cried the attendant and the nurse
Tomorrow’s the day
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
In the beginning, long time ago
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
As they were taking down the tents
Get your mind off wintertime
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
I got eight carburetors, boys I’m using ’em all
For you know not the hour in which I come”
Everything I've ever known to be right has proven wrong
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
And your nose on the ground
There’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck
We living by the golden rule, whoever got the gold rules
I’m avoidin’ the Southside the best I can
You feel to moan but unlike before
But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
Is it really any wonder
I feel like laying down
When he hears you speak
Is the saving grace that’s over me
Ev’rybody knows
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Blow into my face with scorn
You put your eyes in your pocket
It was there he made his bed
			Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I’m givin’ ’em lots of room
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’
The whole night through
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
He been suckin’ the blood out of the genius of generosity
May you always know the truth
Put my best foot forward, stop being influenced by fools
Broken switches, broken gates
I don’t care about astronomy
What God has given to us no man can take away
I owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true
Wrapped around my head
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
How long are we gonna be ridin’?
My pretty baby, she’s lookin’ around
It’s a restless hungry feeling
I just can’t fit
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
Pick up your money
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
When my working day’s through
And ask me to
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
That long black cloud is comin’ down
God knows you ain’t gonna be taking
There’s nothing in here moving
Love that country pie										 
It doesn’t matter in the end
But I mean no harm nor put fault
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
You say my kisses are not like his
Seen better times, but who has not?
From now on I’ll be busy
You've wounded me with words
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
And these bad luck women stick like glue
Howard said there’s only one place I know
Fame and honor never seem to fade
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green
Not by works
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
On anyone that lives in a vault
Didn’t I sleep, didn’t I weep beside you
			The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
An’ like a fool I mixed them
Stripes on your back and on your hands
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
That you have forgotten me? 
The lonesome sparrow sings
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
I don’t wanna be your boss
			Come gather ’round people
Honey, I know where
To gather flowers constantly
And yes, I believe you do
			Seen a shooting star tonight
He hands you a dime
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
He’s not selling any alibis
You probably don't know, but I'm gonna make you mine
And there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend
The only one I know
You follow, find yourself at war
People are crazy and times are strange
Upon four-legged forest clouds
Like you never did before
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
If there’s anyone that knows
So happy just to be alive
Excuse me, ma'am I beg your pardon
Sometimes it’s just plain stupid
When your train gets lost										 
I got a God-fearing woman
I’ve been walking that lonesome valley
You can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold
I'm sweating blood
And because I . . .
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
In the instant that I preach
Oh please send you a friend
I asked Fat Nancy for somethin' to eat, she said, “Take it off the shelf—
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead										 
But it never does
He could die happily ever after
I’ll be your baby tonight										 
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
My mind weaves a symphony
My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime
			How many roads must a man walk down
Nothin' done and nothin' said										 
You that build the big bombs
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it
He looked so immaculately frightful
I used to care, but things have changed
Like some mystery
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
The cat’s in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump
No, there’s nothin’ you can send me, my own true love
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
And pack up your tent
And I, I don’t mind the pain
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
The windows are filled with frost
I know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing still
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Better stay away from those
And her silver-studded phantom cause
An’ to come each time you call
Stand up straight and tall
Go lightly on the ground
When I’m all alone
Please do it fast
And when bringing her name up
And I don’t really care
Might as well keep going now										 
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
Forgetful heart
I’m sailin’ away in the morning
He wasn’t too small and he wasn’t too big
Just then a bolt of lightning
“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said
Storms are on the ocean, storms out on the mountain, too
And she aches just like a woman
And my time it isn’t long
			I can’t understand
With your pencil in your hand
When you were there
My conscience is beginning to bother me today
Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
You don't ever
And let others do for you
The man in the trench coat
“Which Side Are You On?”
God knows when
The world’s being slaughtered and it’s such a bloody disgrace
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart
But oh, mother, things ain't going well
That too many people have died?
You’re gonna have to serve somebody
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Automobile comin’ into style
I’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
You better chew gum
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
I’m puttin’ out your eyes
The motorcycle black madonna
I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
We loved with all the love that life can give
With only you in view
Will be he who has stalled
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Leaving men wholly, totally free
To say you got a helping hand to lend
Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew
The air burns and I’m trying to think straight
If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed
But it would not be new
“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
It’s alright, Ma, I’m only sighing
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
			Well, I’m stranded in the city that never sleeps
The sun is shining, ain’t but one train on this track
I got my hammer ringin’, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t goin’ down
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vines
And tears or not, it’s too much to ask										 
Look around you, it’s just bound to make you embarrassed
You may be living in another country under another name
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen
Yes, and I’ll go last
Great big furry back and furry hair
Don’t the brakeman look good, mama
Where wisdom grows up in strife
Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
As Lady and I look out tonight
Where you been don’t bother me nor bring me down in sorrow
You into thinking you’re the one
Lot of things can get in the way when you’re tryin’ to do what’s right
Saying, “This land is condemned
I’m on the pavement
To find out if she’s talked
It’s only people’s games that you got to dodge
Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand										 
To be alone with you										 
If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do
But these to tell what’s true
To Williams Point
In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line
But you’d better lift your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it babe
With the tombstone blues
But the time has come
Will later be past
My tears keep flowing to the sea
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
And place them at the feet of a harlot
How badly they were shocked
Now I'm all worn down by weepin'
As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Mutiny from stern to bow
I’m going
But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
I’m rollin’ slow, goin’ where the wild roses grow
From Eli he did come
Don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
You can rock this joint
I just can’t do what I done before
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
“I want him dead or alive
I cannot move
Something's out of wack
Or disgrace you or displace you
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
You can’t turn back—you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far
You may call me anything but no matter what you say
			There was a wicked messenger
Light yourself a candle
That’s the way I remember her best.
If I was a master thief
That I’ve still got a dream that hasn’t been repossessed
They’re throwing knives into the tree
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
On this new morning, new morning
But there's no one here that's left to tell
Got to get you out of my miserable brain
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
			They’re selling postcards of the hanging
Oh, though the earth may shake me
My ears hear a symphony
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine
But to the stars above
But the Pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt
While the jury cried for more
The dogs’ll lose their bark
Broken idols, broken heads
Every time you leave and go off someplace
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
By the saving grace that’s over me										 
If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
In ceremonies of the horsemen
And forgot about a simple twist of fate
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied
Mean old twister bearing down on me
From Desolation Row
Heart burnin', still yearnin' 
It’s bad for your health, he said
You got the key to my brain 
What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
I heard the drifter say
And somebody points to you and says
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic”
An’ pretend that you never have met!”										 
			Well, I’m hangin’ on to a solid rock
The next time you see me comin’ you better run”
Who just couldn’t help but cry
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
Gonna give you another chance
So happy just to see you smile
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
I’m just gonna let you pass
An’ me, I nearly got busted
A squall is settin’ in
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone
Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue
But it’s not that way
If you’re so hurt
Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
			She’s got everything she needs
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
Saying, “Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Broken treaties, broken vows
It’s a price I have to pay
She’s tossin’ a baseball bat in the air
How your head feels under somethin’ like that
Before they’re allowed to be free?
Lies that life is black and white
The meat is so tough you can’t cut it with a sword
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
That’s what they explain to me
I was raised in the country, I been workin’ in the town
You’re gonna get hit
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills
You see me on the street
She made well sure her neighbors understood
You have given me life to live
To get you facts
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
What looks good in the day, at night is another thing
His hair’s falling out and all of his daughters need shoes
Babe, I couldn’t find the door
“Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
Kick my legs to crash it off
That we were meant to be more than friends 
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
And picking up Angel who
We’re so alone
That you talk behind my back
With your position and your place
You can’t win with a losing hand
Aladdin and his lamp
To get him to feel more assured
When questioned who had sent for him
I can’t find my knees”
Mysterious and dark
Find out something only dead men know										 
You raise up your head
Knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand										 
Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to make a buck
Eclipses both the sun and moon
And they’ve all liked your looks
Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
To shine in through
Say for me that I’m all right though things get kind of slow
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong
She turned around to look at me
Well, that high tide's risin'
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite
But that’s not where it’s at
To just give a check
Somebody said from the Bible he’d quote
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there										 
One of these days and it won't be long
When your death takes its toll
You won’t regret it
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand
He spoke to me, I took his flute
But mama, you’re just on my mind
But it’s been so strong for so long
You don’t have to worry anymore
I'm wild about you, gal 
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle ’til the moon is blue
If anything is goin’ to sell
No man alive will come to you
			Precious angel, under the sun
There’s a chain gang on the highway
I don’t mean trouble, please don’t put me down or get upset
When I’m gone you will remember my name
I keep listenin’ for footsteps
You say you’re lookin’ for someone
I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath
Praying to the powers above
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden										 
Put some sugar in my bowl
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
And I try to harmonize with songs
Stone-cold dead
I’m leavin’ today
The carpet, too, is moving under you
Blood and water flowing through the land
To be without a home
Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”										 
You took the silver, you took the gold
Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
At pettiness which plays so rough
Who looked so fine at first
Rain won’t lift
You that build all the guns
Well the future for me is already a thing of the past
Best notify my next of kin
To talk out of turn
To keep her from the howlin’ winds
But yes I think it can be very easily done
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
And talk with my chambermaid
I was goin’ to confiscate your lace
But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off
Well, he puts his cigar
No man, no woman knows 
You might say I’m unlearned
And you say, “What’s mine?”
Sorry that’s nothin’ you would need to know
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
Ah get born, keep warm
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
If I didn’t have t’ guess
A little confused, I remember well
Wedding bells ringin’, the choir is beginning to sing
Her sin is her lifelessness
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time										 
And she invites you up into her room
I used to care, but things have changed										 
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
The trailing moss and mystic glow
Someday little girl, you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoe
Sugar Baby, get on down the line
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
And I’ll rock you too
’Cause I don’t be like they’d like me to
This is the blind horse that leads you around
And always tell him, “No?”
But all their daughters put me down
Like Blind Willie McTell										 
For them that must obey authority
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
The Titanic sails at dawn
Of ancient history
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
I’m crashin’ my car, trunk first into the boards
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with
The one was Texas medicine
We all wear the same thorny crown
I’d go crawling down the avenue
It don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere
God knows there’s gonna be no more water
Way out in the wilderness
Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat
Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon
			Señor, señor, do you know where we’re headin’?
And accept it that soon
There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend										 
Obscenity, who really cares
He oversees his kingdom
By this time I’d-a thought I would be sleeping
His mama sure was proud of him!
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain										 
And negativity don’t pull you through
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
An’ I say, “Aw come on now
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
An’ cov’rin’ the crossroads I’m standing at
I’m younger than that now
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise”
			Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen
That you’re better ’n no one
Bury the rag deep in your face
Don't know what work even means 
While calypso singers laugh at them
With every breath you breathe
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
An’ it strangled up my mind
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out lying in the mud
Got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood
That you could not fix
He saw an animal as smooth as glass
That’s how it is when things disintegrate
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord
Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you
We’re gonna forget it
He’s gonna call on you
A question in your nerves is lit
’Cause tonight I’ll be staying here with you
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
You could hear it from the door
And one day the ax just fell
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”										 
Rock me for a little while, rock me ’til there’s nothing left to feel
And every window made of glass
			Forgetful heart
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
If you go down in the flood
God knows the secrets of your heart
With his candle lit into the sun
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
Follow your own ambitions
And I’m seeing the real you at last
Broken cutters, broken saws
Stapled to his chest
Two big bags of dead man’s bones
All that false instruction
And then the kerosene
And see the lights surrounding you
And no matter what they say
Like Judas of old
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
Someone to open each and every door
“Equality,” I spoke the word
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep
If I was still the same
To your tambourine in time, it’s just a ragged clown behind
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
I told her I didn’t really care
Analyze you, categorize you
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
My complexion she said is much too white
She can do the Georgia crawl
			The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
An’ a thousand miles behind										 
You’re right from your side
Every waking moment you could crack
Tears of rage, tears of grief
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Wiggle ’til it answers, wiggle ’til it comes
You that hide behind desks
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
Now, I want you to know that while we watched
Soon to be divorced
How can I explain?
But with the country to where you’re goin’
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
And you walked a rugged mile
When the game got rough
She might think that I’ve forgotten her, don’t tell her it isn’t so
You ain’t goin’ nowhere
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her
My love winks, she does not bother
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”
I’d sure like t’ know
I would want again tomorrow
			I’m walking through streets that are dead
I’d like to get you to change your mind
That Baby can’t be blessed
Though I’m younger than you
Groundhog runnin’ by the country stream
And they put you on the day shift
Dodging lions and wastin’ time
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
To know which way the wind blows
You to me were true
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
Come senators, congressmen
I feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door
I had ’em once though, I suppose, to go along
And I would send a message
The suffering is unending
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?
I know where I would go
When we meet again
I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
The moon gives light and shines by night
The air is thick and heavy all along the levy
Bad blood it got your mare
Broken hands on broken ploughs
To get caught without a ticket
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
You that build the death planes
But all the while I was alone
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
Today I'll stand in faith and raise
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties on the board
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
But he was famous long ago
Rollin’ high and mighty traps
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk
Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost
She said she would never forget
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be										 
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin’
And there was nothing more to tell
You have given all there is to give
As I turn my head back to the room
The fortune-telling lady
Don’t the moon look good, mama
Gonna put my good foot forward
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not”
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Unborn and unnamed
They must bust in early May
Walk on your tiptoes
Take heed of the stormy weather
The man in the coon-skin cap
All lay down their bandanas and complain
That can do what’s never been done
			William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
But mama, you been on my mind
			I’ve just reached a place
You were the answer to my prayer
And he walks on stilts
			If you find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
From the sounds inside my mind
I’m gettin’ up in the morning—I believe I’ll dust my broom
Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck
I was layin’ in bed
Well, the rifleman’s stalking the sick and the lame
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
But it looks like it don’t
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
The sidewalk and the sign
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
This sky, too, is folding under you
Take the rag away from your face
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books
Even though you’ve only seen ’m one time or two
I've been trampling through mud
From darkness, dreams’re deserted
’Cause tonight I’ll be staying here with you										 
So now I’m goin’ back again
There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere
It don’t even matter to me where you’re wakin’ up tomorrow
God knows there’s a chance
And there’s nothing she doesn’t see
Can’t you feel that sun a-shinin’?
“Ah, think I’ll call it a cow”
Then why don’t she tell
In this room the heat pipes just cough
Girl by the whirlpool
Oh! Good old-fashioned war!
But left looking just like a ghost
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you
My grandfather was a duck trapper
Thank You, Lord										 
I’m just glad it’s over
			Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Summer days, summer nights are gone
And the smell of their roses does not remain
With a crashing but meaningless blow
And then he clicks his high heels
“It takes one to know one,” she smiles
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side
I had so much left to do
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
From Desolation Row										 
Against you comin’ around
With all the ring-dancin’ Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
And no one is better ’n you
The cloak and dagger dangles
There’s a Man up on a cross and He’s been crucified
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
I’m gonna let you pass
When it’s you who must keep it satisfied
We never did too much talkin’ anyway
			I love you pretty baby 
See them big plantations burning
Emptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe”
Down to your deathbed
He’ll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Freed me from the pit
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
On the pillow where you lie
You always act surprised
Ancient footprints are everywhere
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
My sister, she ran off and got married
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
Any day now, any day now
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection
I just wouldn’t have a clue
To do anything they wish to do but die
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
Saved
I’m stepping out of the dark woods, I’m jumping on the monkey’s back
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
That you belong to
In you, my friend, I find no blame
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
			Our conversation was short and sweet
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
Let us hope they’ve found mercy in their bone-filled graves
Take or shake or forsake you out
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’
I’m hungry and I’m irritable
I had a job in the great north woods
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
May you grow up to be true
Leanin’ on the windowsill
I'm pale as a ghost
Well the leaves are rustlin’ in the wood—things are fallin’ off of the shelf
God say, “No.” Abe say, “What?”
It must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two A.M. booty call
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
Bankers’ nieces seek perfection
And I walk out on my own
Wond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie										 
And Madonna, she still has not showed
And he dropped his medals down into her hand										 
Did I hear someone’s distant cry?
We’ll both just sit there and stare
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell
With his friend, a jealous monk
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
There’s nothin’ I wish to be ownin’
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
What he don’t know to begin with
But the post office has been stolen
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door										 
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
You think I'm past my prime
When you are near 
May your heart always be joyful
Trouble always comes to pass
God knows you’ve got to weep
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
You might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread
I been walkin’ the road
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
And your legs can’t seem to stand
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed
I always kind of wondered
And I see through your brain
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
She put down in writing what was in her mind
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
When I paint my masterpiece										  
And I wait for them to interrupt
While preachers preach of evil fates
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
You will start out standing
’Til I’m sure that you’re dead										 
But you’re gonna have to serve somebody										 
I’m so glad
Though it shadows metal badge
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
He saw an animal that liked to growl
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
You used to be so amused
I’ve escaped death so many times, I know I’m only living
It sure is good to see you comin’ today"
They walked along by the old canal
Many times I’ve often prayed
Sometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Though breathlike
Shut softly your watery eyes
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Jefferson turnin’ over in his grave
Now there’s spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down
I and I
She promised that she’d be right there with me
Underneath the sky of blue
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Inside of a leather cup
Well my captain he’s decorated—he’s well schooled and he’s skilled
They’re spoonfeeding Casanova
Daylight sneakin’ through the window
And the superhuman crew
Before it gets late
She just acts like we never have met
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’
While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
With no direction home
They’re just gonna have to wait
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try
I wasn’t born to lose you
Keep me where you are
And I won’t let go and I can’t let go, won’t let go
Living in the Land of Nod
I’m walkin’ down that long, lonesome road, babe
A real suicide case, but there was nothin’ I could do to stop it
Just so you know where He’s coming from
On back to the South
			Mama, take this badge off of me
I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh
To see you tryin’ to be a part of
You cut to the core
I'm going away baby
Getting light outside, the temperature dropped
Finalize you or advertise you
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Goodnight, my love, may the Lord have mercy on us all										 
Or else expecting rain
I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Will it buy you forgiveness
And offered me a pipe
’Neath her Panamanian moon
They’ll stone you and then say you are brave
And wrap it up in a sailor’s knot
I watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on
			If not for you
I’m gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules
Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
And if you hear vague traces of skippin’ reels of rhyme
And the people that confronted him were many
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
He saw an animal that liked to snort
I'm trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to go home
Another one of them endless days
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Cultivate their flowers to be
I been in a brawl
I’m sure your heart is not with me
They'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
I can smell the tail of the dragon
To get you your favors done
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
Then they’ll stone ya when you’re there all alone
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
The line it is drawn
One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
By His grace I have been touched
I’m no pig without a wig
Sky full of fire, pain pourin’ down
All except for Cain and Abel
Rain would gather too
You can just follow your nose
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Now you don’t talk so loud
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
As to be under the strength of your skin
Queen Mary, she’s my friend
I’m going down the river
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
While them that defend what they cannot see
With the tombstone blues										 
Down boulevards of broken cars
I scarcely feel the glow
He’s lookin’ for the fuse
Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
In the great unknown
We’ll go out and see it sometime
They’re painting the passports brown
Has been twisted and fed
She gone with the man
Saying, “Throw me somethin’, Mister, please”
Who just happened to be feelin’ that way without warnin’
And a cannonball blew my eyes away”
I can’t hear you anymore
I tried to give you everything
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
You gonna need my help, sweetheart
But you’re doin’ it again
To the valley below
From their fates try to resign
Why you can't treat me right
An’ the silent night will shatter
Out to where the trucks are rollin’ slow
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
			I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
Now you would not think to look at him
And the princess and the prince
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
And I stopped in for a beer
She already is an old maid
Get back, write braille
That Johanna’s not here
For the times they are a-changin’
Look up, look up—seek your Maker—’fore Gabriel blows his horn
He’s getting ready for the show
Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ ’long the street
Get deathlike at times
			Seen the arrow on the doorpost
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bear”
They run a brick-and-tile company
You’ll remember you’re the one
To be alone with you
People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
I’d be sad and blue
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
Relationships of ownership
May you have a strong foundation
I started out on burgundy
Well, he hands you a nickel
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
I don’t want to fake you out
May you stay forever young
			Stake my future on a hell of a past
You think He’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires
The drunken politician leaps
I'll be drifting along
Strike another match, go start anew
Unthought of, though, somehow
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
Another best friend, somehow
They seem determined to go all the way
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
From my toes up to my ears
On the back of the fish truck that loads
The night passed away so quickly
Private reasons great or small
You can make it too
To say you are my friend
Burns with the bark still on
You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
Saying, “Master, tell me why a man must be born again”
You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy
Come closer
And I just turn my back while you silently die
I believe in you when winter turn to summer
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
Brains in the pot, they’re beginning to boil
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
And someday maybe
Jolene, Jolene     
Nobody to rescue me
Maggie comes fleet foot
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
It could even be like a myth
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
For now’s the time for your tears										 
I got a head full of ideas
That not much is really sacred
I’m still trying to get used to
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more										 
How much do I know
Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Broken pipes, broken tools
Yes, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Badge out, laid off
Thinking about the government
Either one, I don’t care”
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
He said every man’s conscience is vile and depraved
Walkin' through the leaves, falling from the trees
But what’s worse
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
I think the rain has stopped
You say you’re lookin' for someone
I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt
The walls of pride are high and wide
As I walked out in the mystic garden
Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last
What good am I if I know and don’t do
Someone to close his heart
That they don’t know how to smile
You don't remember at all
This wheel shall explode!										 
My woman got a face like a teddy bear
Leaves are rustlin’ in the wood—things are fallin’ off the shelf
Lift up your eyes
			Crimson flames tied through my ears
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?
Of your useless and pointless knowledge
An’ though the rules of the road have been lodged
I see my light come shining
Before it’s washed to the sea?
			Can’t you hear that rooster crowin’?
I want you so bad
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
It’s like I ain’t here
Not unless you mail them
Time is pilin’ up, we struggle and we scrape
I found my world, found my world in you
They say ev’ry man needs protection
Every day your memory grows dimmer
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
I care so much for you—didn’t think that I could
It’s a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
And on the highway of regret
Though you might hear laughin’, spinnin’, swingin’ madly across the sun
Tossed by the winds and the seas
Can’t you hear that motor turnin’?
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
And froze up inside
The side that’s winning
Were fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiary
Don’t stand in the doorway
So I’ll just say fare thee well
Forever young, forever young
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
For the others to fire
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
And now he’s buried in the rocks
The wind howls like a hammer
Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself
They’ll stone ya when you’re at the breakfast table
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
He stayed behind the assembly hall
Everybody must get stoned
Seeing the real you at last										 
Graveyards, false gods, I scuff
As the night comes in a-fallin’
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose
An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Yet ev’ry distance is not near
You spent your last lone dollar
When you knew I had some other place to be
You went years without me
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you?
He hears the ticking of the clocks
Nothin' standing there
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
There’s a kingdom called Heaven
It’s just a shadow you’re seein’ that he’s chasing
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
So I’m going
Do you, Mister Jones?
Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain’t right
That runs in your veins
I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate
I’ll remember you										 
The city fathers they’re trying to endorse
I’m lettin’ the cat out of the cage, I’m keeping a low profile
			Standing on the waters casting your bread
Purple blossoms soft as snow
But he’s badly built
People carry roses
It’s too hot to sleep, time is running away
You better duck down the alley way
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
Right now I can’t read too good
And careful not to go to her too soon
I been playin’ it straight
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
But even the president of the United States
I’m not even acquainted with my own desires
Well, they’ll stone you and say that it’s the end
There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
You that never done nothin’
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
“You look like the silent type”
Spouted out that liberty
And I’m so glad
Drag you down or drain you down
“Oh, stop that cursed jury”
I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word
To memorizing politics
You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days
So take heed, take heed of the western wind
But you don’t mean it
And leaves you howling at the moon
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Throw my ticket out the window
The last thing you said before you hit the street
And yes, there’s something you can send back to me
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
And sit before it gets too late
Darlin’, I’m a-countin’ on you
You forgot to close the garage door
It's gonna be the meanest flood
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
That hype you and type you
The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan
I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk
There’s no books upon your shelf
And somebody else says, “Where what is?”
Then he said, “Jump right in”
Every day you got to give yourself a chance
Waiting for the trains
Things fall to pieces in my face
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
I was dreaming I was sleepin' in Rosie’s bed
You may be a construction worker working on a home
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
To wait upon him hand and foot
Now, it's king for king
Everybody got to move somewhere
“You Belong to Me I Believe”
There are no mistakes in life some people say
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Just like a mattress balances
I have no one to meet
I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Her profession’s her religion
Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw
O'er the road we're bound to go
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
All that’s gold isn’t meant to shine
One more cup of coffee ’fore I go
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately
With the one who tries to hide
Through the world mysterious and vague
She’s a hypnotist collector
I want to thank You, Lord
Don’t put on any airs
Well I’m drivin’ in the flats in a Cadillac car
Everything inside is made of stone
You might be a rock ’n’ roll addict prancing on the stage
I never slept with her even once
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
Must I always be the thief?
But don’t think twice, it’s all right
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts
Struck the courthouse out of shape
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
			My love she speaks like silence
All your reindeer armies, are all going home
You can hurt someone and not even know it
I know a place where there’s still somethin’ going on
Wait for the mornin’ light
I see that stationmaster, too
All and all can only fall
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
That anybody's seen
What happens next
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay
Neither one gonna turn and run
’Stead of acting like we never have met
An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want”
You have explained every mystery
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
And as for compensation, there’s little he would ask
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
That knows more than they do
We were goin’ to meet again and wait
I know the kinds of things you like
Now the rovin’ gambler he was very bored
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
What good am I if I say foolish things
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
God knows it’s a struggle
They may call you Doctor or they may call you Chief
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
Without ideals or violence
Through the back alleys—through the blinds
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
I don't have to wonder no more
Around you have grown
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met
Across the swooping plain?
Then you ache just like a woman
Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I just don’t see why I should even care
I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
Will there be any comfort there, señor?
There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And after ev’ry plan had failed
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
In the end
I won’t come here no more if it bothers you
Yeah, today has been a sad ol’ lonesome day
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
To a shadow
Leaves begin to stir
Propaganda, all is phony
Walking, walking with you in my head
What good am I?										 
Now if you see Saint Annie
Says he’s got a bad cough
How does it feel
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
And admit that the waters
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
The curse it is cast
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Inside, the judge was stepping down
To get into any kind of wind
			They say ev’rything can be replaced
			Nobody feels any pain
Don’t wear sandals
Watch the river flow
He asks you with a grin
Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
She’s an artist, she don’t look back
The times we knew
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
All these people that you mention
She ain't no angel and neither am I
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
God knows there’s a river
The human mind can only stand so much
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
It doesn’t matter inside the Gates of Eden
On Desolation Row
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself										 
Bent out of shape from society’s pliers
I had so little time to fail
You hide in your mansion
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait
’Cause the vandals took the handles										 
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Well, I’m preachin’ peace and harmony
I always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day
If you really believe that
Buried under tobacco leaves
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four
I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
She gave her heart to the man
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street
You to me were the best
There’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lot
He could not keep
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?										 
I just want you to know
The lonesome organ grinder cries
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there
You remember only about the brass ring
I’m countin’ on you love, to give me a break
They will crush you with wealth and power
He saw milk comin’ out but he didn’t know how
Oh what dear daughter ’neath the sun
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
And now you’d throw us all aside
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
			What’s the matter with me
Valentines can’t buy her
She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her
I been livin’ on the edge
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
Everything changes
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
			I’ll remember you
Señor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather
Who would remember better then you
You can get wrecked in this dance."
Got their noses to the grindstones
Now the wintertime is coming
Last night the wind was whisperin’ somethin’—I was trying to make out what it was
How can I live for You?
I can't save a dime
You say ya got some
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And the only sound that’s left
No, and I ain’t lookin’ to fight with you
From phony jealousy
All night long
He’s a coward and he steals
And she takes your voice
Couldn’t even see the floor
Life without you 
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
They all fall there so perfectly
She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
Fear to bring children
Are beyond your command
Soul to soul, our shadows roll
To sit down on this bank of sand
They say ev’ry man must fall
I’m right from mine
When they all come down and did tricks for you
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today 
Tomorrow keeps turning around
To Desolation Row
You might have drugs at your command, women in a cage
You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you
I met one man who was wounded in love
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Don’t know how it all got started
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Papa gone mad, mamma, she’s feeling sad
And a wanderer by trade
Your brain is a-bleedin’
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
Well, they’re going to the country, they’re gonna retire
And reciting the alphabet
That I might be gone a long time
Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
She said, “Boy, without a doubt
Broken bottles, broken plates
Come writers and critics
The other was just railroad gin
And when finally the bottom fell out
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
I'm in a cowboy band
I’ve seen enough heartaches and strife
I just can’t be happy, love
And the whole world is on your case
			Of war and peace the truth just twists
What made them want to come and blow you away?										 
When he’s standing in front of you
Perhaps I’d rob them
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue
Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank
			When the rain is blowing in your face
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
But now mornin’s clear
The night is so long and the table is oh, so full
But the enemy I see
Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall
God sees it all unfold
We learn to live and then we forgive
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
High water risin’, six inches ’bove my head
We’re so low
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
The old one is long gone
You’re the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night
I'm movin' after midnight
You can have your cake and eat it too
With twenty pounds of headlines
No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?
Up on Housing Project Hill
Then time will tell just who fell
If it’s really that expensive kind
For tonight when I’ll be staying here with you
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee										 
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
He made it to Kansas City
Jolene, Jolene
And He never give up ’til the battle’s lost or won
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
They say lose your inhibitions
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
A tear came to his eye
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go 
But I don’t know what “all right” even means
My toes too numb to step
See what you can do
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?										 
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
You put a gun in my hand
Everybody says
Don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read
Written by an Italian poet
Ev’rything is always right
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
Your sweet voice
			There's an evenin' haze settlin' over the town
He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense
Down in the easy chair!
To try and make me change my mind and stay
I’m in the streets
			I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
It was you who understood
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
Why don’t you just come out once
It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
She said that all the railroad men
And without further notice
Then they’ll stone you and then they’ll come back again
And your death’ll come soon
Broken dishes, broken parts
Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years
Never was heard of any more
Then she hung it on a wall
The cat’s in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
That last night I was with
They say that nighttime is the right time
And you say, “For what reason?”
But power and greed and corruptible seed
I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall
With his pointed shoes and his bells
They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ to the door
As she showed them to the people from next door
You burned your way into my heart 
I can’t shoot them anymore
Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinkin' fast
You thought they were all kiddin’ you
Boys in the street beginning to play
As the present now
Race or chase you, track or trace you
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory
To protect you an’ defend you
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
I don’t have much to say
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Well, I’m hangin’ on to a solid rock
I'd forgotten about you
“You fail to understand,” he said
That you ain’t a-got no friend
You can carry all my thoughts with you
			If your mem’ry serves you well
Person crying
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I’m glad I fought—I only wish we’d won
Didn’t I, didn’t I try to care?
And one day he came passing by
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
Your voice is like a meadowlark
			Oh, the ragman draws circles
Like balloons made out of lead
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
And life is brief										  
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
She studied the lines on my face
It’s easy to see without looking too far
It ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe
Though I know that evenin’s empire has returned into sand
To the tree with roots
I remember her whispering yet
I’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fade
I’m sick of love but I’m in the thick of it
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
They’re drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief
Bye and bye, on you I’m casting my eye
And you’re sick of all this repetition
It’s your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat										 
Discuss what’s real and what is not
			May God bless and keep you always
They tell you, “Time is money,” as if your life was worth its weight in gold
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
With the rain blowing in your hair?
Shut the light, shut the shade
You know it’s not like that
And someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve
It’s all new t’ me
Still I wish there was somethin’ you would do or say
Am I here all alone?”
Bette Davis style
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl										 
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
Just to know that you are near
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
You could ride like Annie Oakley
As she, herself, prepares for him
Well, it's sugar for sugar
Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through
That only you could see?
But me, I’m still on the road
We drove that car as far as we could
Sugar Baby get on down the line
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal’s death
So I’m goin’ to unpack all my things
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
I been all around the world, boys
We live and we die, we know not why
Don’t steal, don’t lift
If dogs run free, then what must be
He bought me with a price
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Ain’t runnin’ any race
I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
There was music in the cafés at night
The drifter did escape										   
And I’ll stand o’er your grave
Wears a cloak of decency
Mixing up the medicine
I’ll close my eyes and I wonder
To think I’d make contact
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
Yes, I wish that for just one time
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice
The love that a stranger might receive
And but for the sky there are no fences facin’
But me, I expected it to happen
She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back
Your babies are crying louder now
I can’t even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough
The other is in his pants
The clouds are turnin’ crimson–the leaves fall from the limbs an’
God don’t call it treason
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
Yes, ’n’ how many years can some people exist
All I really want to do
Chain you down or bring you down
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
And glowed like burnin’ coal
And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Tell me that it isn’t true
Life sometimes must get lonely
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
But all his sexless patients
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
It was a childish thing to do
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing
I long to reach for you in the night
Please her, please him, buy gifts
But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only										 
To the old folks home and the college
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”
I’ll come and be cryin’ to you										 
Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
Into the world
			Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it
Broken voices on broken phones
Little Jack Horner’s got nothin’ on me
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
Temptation’s page flies out the door
Some are mathematicians
And the ladies treat me kindly
			To be alone with you
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore
			’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
You're something nice, I'm gonna grab my dice
They would turn into a meaningless ring
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby
I don’t carry deadweight—I’m no flash in the pan
The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
			I ain’t lookin’ to compete with you
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
Into a life of continual crime
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
Hang around the theaters
Feelin' like a stranger nobody sees
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
They’re a-tuggin’ at your sleeve
Couldn’t hear the robin sing
Like I see through the water
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
Starlight by the edge of the creek
Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane
They know the secrets of the breeze
I wish that for just one time
They’re like babies sittin’ on a woman’s knee
You’ve been through all of
True love they’ve been without it
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
We see this empty cage now corrode
Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do
To be stuck inside of Mobile
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
All across the peaceful sacred fields
A cold coyote calls
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
“Your presence is obnoxious to me”
They’re trying to blow it up
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
Guess I owe You some kind of apology
By the big pen
Mama’s in the fact’ry
I’ve got nothin’ but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me
For he that gets hurt
We walked together hand in hand.
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
Only one thing I did wrong
The most unfortunate circumstances?
You’ve no need to linger here
To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”
I ain’t lookin’ for you to feel like me
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Why did they have to come and blow you away?
Well, I’ve been up all night, baby
Mona tried to tell me
The same thing I want from you today
			If dogs run free, then why not we
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
Your loyalty is not to me
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
But the second mother was with the seventh son
The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
They’re dripping with garlic and olive oil
Make myself a different set of rules
Your old road is rapidly agin’
Well, I’m scufflin’ and I’m shufflin’ and I’m walkin’ on briars
Wiggle ’til it bites, wiggle ’til it cuts
But I don’t feel alone
Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide
If you don’t know by now
The place I love best is a sweet memory
Somebody seen him hanging around
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
I hope you treat me kind
On this new morning with you
Throughout the land
A bed that is never mine
Before they’re forever banned?
I got to get to her somehow
It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist
You’ve thrown the worst fear
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
On the pages and the text
“What’s good for you is good for me”
Wiggle ’til it opens, wiggle ’til it shuts
But I know what he really loves you for
			Gonna change my way of thinking
Trustin’ their fate to the Hands of God
Someone hit me from behind
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
Which we never could believe
Stripes on your shoulders
I’m gonna spare the defeated, boys, I’m going to speak to the crowd
It don’t matter, anyhow
An’ left me here facing the wall
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf
There was dust on the man
Preacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave
			You say you love me
When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
They’ll stone ya when you are young and able
“You can’t open your mind, boys
Flagging down the “Double E?”
Wish I was back in the city
Down in the easy chair!										 
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
Can you tell me who to contact here, señor?
Is worth more than I could pay
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
Now the rainman gave me two cures
You have to pay to get out of
Like a rolling stone?										 
That I was just a puppet in a play
From the place that I’ll be landing?
			Every step of the way we walk the line
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
For deep in my heart
Girls’ faces formed the forward path
You got a face that begs for love 
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing 
The wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it
It’s the last temptation, the last account
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated
One more cup of coffee for the road
If you lean your head out far enough
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
And be discovered beneath a truck
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
Gonna change my way of thinking
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake . . .										 
It is made out of bricks
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long										  
But build to destroy
Whatever you gonna do
			Perhaps it’s the color of the sun cut flat
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you
I’m going off into the woods, I’m huntin’ bare
It’s not always easy kicking someone out
To get up and take another shot
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
“Ah, think I’ll call it a sheep”
I used to be among the crowd
When I was in Missouri
			It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe
But it doesn’t matter
For playing the electric violin
And that failure’s no success at all
You know it balances on your head
You can almost think that you’re seein’ double
So don’t think twice, it’s all right
And every one of them words rang true
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
Well, I saw him
Thunder rolling over Clarkesdale, everything is looking blue
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
You discover there was no one true
But old, young, age don’t carry weight
Oh, when the night is disappearing
			Johnny’s in the basement
That they do not respect in any degree
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
Must be, and that is all
His bedroom window
Joey, Joey
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve
And I’m gonna let you pass
Don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Like a rolling stone?
			I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
With the heat rising in my eyes
Has dimmed my sights
My bride’s gonna come
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Which goes from bad to worse?
I never wanted to go back there—I’d rather have died
Seven shots ring out
Why can't we love like we did before
And that’s the authority on high
I’m a little too blind to see
And relive my dreams
It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe										 
There's no one here, the gardener is gone
One I can easily afford
I’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
Everybody said they’d stand behind me
When he’s playin’ ’til the break of day
People can’t wait—they’re gathered around
Nobody would dare
For I’m one too many mornings
You try so hard
“Ah, think I’ll call it a pig”
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
To win friends and influence his uncle
Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
And it’s only that I’m askin’
The Siamese twins are comin’ to town
Didn’t I, didn’t I try to love you?
I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
I don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Its curfew gull just glides
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light
Why she did go
About Desolation Row
You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees
Silver and gold
Or from the coast of Barcelona
Watch the parkin’ meters
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more
I'll avenge my father's death then I'll step back
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
I don’t need much and that ain’t no lie
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bull”
After the ambulances go
And I won’t let go, and I can’t let go, won’t let go
You just kinda wasted my precious time
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
Please understand me, I got no place for you t’ go
Water pourin’ into Vicksburg, don’t know what I’m goin' to do
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
			God don’t make no promises that He don’t keep
How was I to know you’d be the one
And how I know I’ll make it through
			I was blinded by the devil
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Never weak but always strong
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
I’m a-thinkin’ and a-wond’rin’ all the way down the road
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
We walked together hand in hand
This kind of love I’m so sick of it
He saw an animal leavin’ a muddy trail
Have died in battle or in vain
I’m gone										 
The world of research has gone berserk
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Some people never worked a day in their life
It was all very painless
I can be just like you
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
You been so bold and so cold
There’s no water in your well
Her folks they said our lives together
I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
That don’t mean no one no good
Keep a clean nose
You were my first love and you will be my last
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down										 
I’ve followed the river and I got to the sea
I crossed that river just to be where you are
One of the boss’ hangers-on
And my best friend, my doctor
The cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me
I ain’t looking for nothing in anyone’s eyes
For that’s all I’m wishin’ to be ownin’
This wheel shall explode!
If you ever made it through
And, mama, you've been refused
I just can’t beg you anymore
Shall pass as your senses will rise
But you break just like a little girl										 
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?										 
Like a corkscrew to my heart
“The trial was bad enough
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
			What good am I if I’m like all the rest
I’m stark naked, but I don’t care
Wiggle ’til it whispers, wiggle ’til it hums
			Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby
I can't stay away 
Open up the gate for you
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart
			Come you masters of war
The order is rapidly fadin’
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile										 
I will follow your casket
Seem like every time you stop and turn around
He answered with his thumb
Nothing to win and nothing to lose
That called on me to call on them
Where the willow don’t bend
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
’Cause I don’t think about it
Instead of this old bank of sand
Like Blind Willie McTell
Singin’ just for you
Still capture the minutes I’m in
All I would like you to do
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
I’m forty miles from the mill—I’m droppin’ it into overdrive
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down
Made before the foundation of the world
And paint the daytime black
Well, there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
Noontime, and I’m still pushin’ myself along the road, the darkest part
I got the porkchops, she got the pie
They’d like to drive me from this town
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
The empty-handed painter from your streets
That you know I believe are true
The cowboy angel rides
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
So don’t fear if you hear
Well a childish dream is a deathless need
But you know you’re not that strong
What good am I while you softly weep
See the ghosts of slavery ships
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
But I ain’t hearing any
And scream it
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you
And later on as the crowd thinned out
The last radio is playing
Told the first father that things weren’t right
Listen to the fiddler play
			Crash on the levee, mama
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Winter would have no spring
Just don’t know what to do
They’ve got a parade permit and a police escort
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Well, I sailed through the storm
			Clouds so swift
Now, I’ve just got to cut loose
Into Desolation Row
He said, “All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth”
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”
Oh, the leaves began to fallin’
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
You can tell by the way she smiles
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft
To be with the one you love
Someone who will die for you an’ more
The cat’s in the well, and Papa is reading the news
Don’t think twice, it’s all right
Twenty years of schoolin’
I don’t care
Where my love and I have laid
The whole world is my throne
Traveling through the dawn of day
Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head
Saying I don’t know when I’ll be comin’ back again
“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
The whole world is filled with speculation
We’re both just one too many mornings
And all of your children start to resent you
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Listen to me pretty baby
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
You are dearer to me than myself
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
Keep me set apart
It’s all just a dream, babe
It was from her ship a-sailin’
There ought to be a law
I rode with him in a taxi once
Broken bodies, broken bones
It blows the minds most bitterly
Please heed the call
Didn’t I take chances?
People sleeping in broken beds
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
			Oh, I’m sailin’ away my own true love
But now something has changed
You may be workin’ in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair
They’ll stone you when you’re playing your guitar
To satisfy, insure you not to quit
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
Wiggle on your hands and knees
Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
And if my love is real
As I was walkin’ away
The fog is so thick that you can’t even spy the land
You have many contacts
I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you
I’m gone
I know you always say that you agree
Sometimes I wonder 
When you asked how I was doing
You can say it just as good.
Wiggle like a big fat snake										 
			Throw my ticket out the window
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
They’re doing the double shuffle, they’re throwin’ sand on the floor
Is brought down from the castles
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
Keeping away from the women
Before he can hear people cry?
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
You made it there somehow
Some things are too terrible to be true
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
			John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
But I never did like it all that much
You lose yourself, you reappear
When you go your way and I go mine
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
You had no faith to lose
Let me ask you one question
Blues this morning falling down like hail
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
She’s got everything she needs
Will later be fast
Me drinkin’ from my broken cup
But nobody has any respect
She once was a true love of mine
Honey, I want you
He crosses himself
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Hand me down my walkin' cane
Of what belongs to me
The best is always yet to come
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Don’t matter what you did
Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze
Your wife’s screams are stabbin’ you
Can’t see over to the other side
Beyond here lies nothin'
All of those awful things that I have heard
Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble
They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk
Well, they’re living in a happy harmony
Oh me, oh my
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads
From the crossroads of my doorstep
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
In the home of the brave
Do you take me for such a fool
			Lost John sitting on a railroad track
Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
To make you feel my love
There are some kind of things you can never kill
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
All except when ’neath the trees of Eden
But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?
God knows it’s fragile
Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
While others say don’t hate nothing at all
When we get up to it
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Both agreeing it was best
You must pick up one or the other
So pray from the mother
I could live forever
I catch a lot, sometimes too many
You’ve been with the professors
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
Just as long as you stay with me
I'll drag ‘em all down to hell and I'll stand ‘em at the wall
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
With a note in his hand which read
’Cause I believe in you
She’s looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
I seen a lot of women
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Can’t stand the suspense anymore
She’s got no place to fall
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
A summer breeze is blowing
Wiggle—you can raise the dead
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
			Ramona
People disagreeing everywhere you look
I went to tell everybody
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
And stop being influenced by fools
But there’s violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
They say times are hard, if you don’t believe it
You broke a heart that loved you
He gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
At the end of the trail
God knows it could snap apart right now
The slow one now
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
I take what I get until I even the score
You give something up for everything you gain
Blame it on a simple twist of fate										 
They need somewhere to go
No doubt in my mind where you belong
Wants to get it paid off
Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put
Whether you are right or wrong
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
All the money you made
Well, I’m standin’ on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the King
I’d give anything to be with you										 
			Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”
And it’s alright, Ma, I can make it
They’ll stone ya just a-like they said they would
Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way
King of the streets, child of clay
Some place so high above this wall
Other kinda lover
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
It's a new path that we trod
Crying out that he was framed
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
An’ it ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe
If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But I used a little too much force
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
Well, you must tell me, baby
Just arrived here from the coast
I don’t have the strength
Then you do wrong all night 
The blessings of tranquility
I do believe I’ve had enough										 
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don’t show one
An’ if anybody asks me
You say you lost your faith
I came to see you
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
My captain, he’s decorated—he’s well schooled and he’s skilled
Can't take much more
Everybody get ready—lift your glasses and sing
And man they expect the same
There’s seven new people born										 
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
Where lovely mermaids flow
			The guilty undertaker sighs
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
There is no sense in trying
It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
He pushed the table over to protect his family
So darlin’, I’m countin’ on you
I tell myself something’s comin’
He could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork
Well Abe says, “Where do you want this killin’ done?”
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
And then say God bless him
Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all
While some on principles baptized
Try to avoid the scandals
For tellin’ stories
			There was a little boy and there was a little girl
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
Read books, repeat quotations
Heart burnin' – still yearnin'
I’m not the one you want, babe
For the loser now will be later to win
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
And you want somebody you don’t have to speak to
			Crickets are chirpin’, the water is high
Supplied with sleep
And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad
So no stranger does intrude
And shot it full of holes
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
The cat’s in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump
Ain’t it hard when you discover that
In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
When you get home
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin’
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And said that way down on Highway 61
They approve of me and share my code
And you’re always achin’
Bringin’ me all of your charms
Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go
Or inspect you or reject you
Might as well keep going now
And I still do not know
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
It all seems so well timed
Too noble to neglect
There’s an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck
With another tale to tell
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I knew he’d lost control
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Carrying a dead man's shield 
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Slip away
All the people we used to know
Now you see this one-eyed midget
They’ve got him in a trance
There’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June
When the death count gets higher
Unto the shoeless hunter who’s gone deaf
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
This place don’t make sense to me no more
The circus is in town
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
God knows there ain’t anybody
Handing out free tickets
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make it
You ain’t got no sense, no how
Using ideas as my maps
When the fast bullets fly
Is there any truth in that, señor?
Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Swamp's gonna rise
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly
“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I don’t need them anymore
Of any circumstance
Don’t you and your one true love ever part”
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Showing ev’ryone his gun
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
Discussed lepers and crooks
			Well, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
Well, I wake in the morning
But it was more than I could do
When I asked him why he dressed
Flung down by corpse evangelists
A world war can be won
Gargles in the rat race choir
Shouting the word “NOW”
I believe in you even on the morning after
You may be somebody’s mistress, may be somebody’s heir
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
I’m ready when you are, señor
They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will
The hour that sorrow will come
If I was with ’er too long
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
As young people’s blood
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick
			You have given everything to me
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking
Cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Can’t keep track of it no more
You’re going to Sodom and Gomorrah
Michelangelo indeed could’ve carved out your features
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
And they were both out on Highway 61
I don’t care about economy
Sailin’ round the world in a dirty gondola
Mama, you been on my mind
The old men ’round here, sometimes they get
People think they know, but they're all wrong
I’m just sittin’ here thinking
And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
Even if we’ve got to walk a million miles by candlelight										 
But this time I’m not gonna tell you why that is
Your magnetic movements
Go to the ends of the earth for you
In the long black coat
And I hope that you die
			Summer days, summer nights are gone
I’m just sitting here beating on my trumpet
It’s not aimed at anyone, it’s just escapin’ on the run
A lover for your life an’ nothing more
I’m gonna revitalize my thinking, I’m gonna let the law take its course
It has the opposite effect
Proud ’neath heated brow
Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail
City’s just a jungle; more games to play
With a killer’s pride, security
			If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
When the winds of changes shift
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
That your heart was longing for
High water everywhere										 
Before I get to the ledge
If it bothers you so much”
Salute her when her birthday comes
As he hands you a bone
They show me to the door
Freedom just around the corner for you
Someone to close his eyes for you
Or have done something wrong
I spied my true love comin’ my way
In the beginning, in the beginning
Got nothin' for you, I had nothin' before
When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered,
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Things I never meant nor wished to say
An’ here I sit so patiently
With all these promises you left for me
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
And wait for succeeding kings
It depends on how I’m a-feelin’
I’ll say, “It’s easily done
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
Or else go home”
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
My ship is in the harbor
In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free
I’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can’t control
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!
For the times they are a-changin’										 
God knows it’s terrifying
Simplify you, classify you
The kingdoms of Experience
Morning came and morning went
Something else just hit the ground
And You’ve chosen me to be among the few
May your wishes all come true
			Shadows are falling and I’ve been here all day
Saying, “Death to all those who would whimper and cry”
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
I’m sure your mind is roamin’
Walkin' ‘til I'm clean out of sight
Speaking to some French girl
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
He woke up, the room was bare
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Your daddy he’s an outlaw
If there’s a poor boy on the street
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
I’d be lost if not for you
And have it on Highway 61										 
I do not walk the floor bowed down an’ bent, but yet
She spends her time peeking
When you're with me
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Who will promise never to part
To strict party platform ties
The ladies down in Darktown, they’re doing the Darktown Strut
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
			Go ’way from my window
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee 
Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
			God knows you ain’t pretty
Has even taken all her things inside
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown
Do you think that it could
I got nothin’ to say, ’specially about whatever was
You'll never see me frown
This wheel’s on fire
They’re getting ready for the feast
I get my sweet reward
Had to be held down by big police
The hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim
You have no idea what you do to me
I should have left this town this morning
The Law can’t touch her at all
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Man’s ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don’t apply no more
But you’re gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
For so long I’ve been stalled
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But soon my words
Down upon your knees
I’m tellin’ myself I found true happiness
To know that some other man is holdin’ you tight
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
He said come here and step into the light, he says hmm you’re right
Have to make a fuss over me
Says, “You’re dancin’ with whom they tell you to
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head
From all the plans they do pursue
Or maybe it’s the weather or something like that
While money doesn’t talk, it swears
Why would I want to take your life?
That I took up arms against you
She was standing there in back of my chair
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea
I’m not sorry for nothin’ I’ve done
These memories I got, they can strangle a man
Things are breakin’ up out there
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
There’s too many people, too many to recall
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
Is this pain in here
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Like a walking shadow in my brain
Window wide open, African trees
To Jerusalem”
Well, if I die
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
And keep your eyes wide
“Don’t reach out for me,” she said
For threatening my baby
And tells me of her dreams
That the finishin’ end is at hand
In His love I am secure
Try to be a success
By His word I have been healed
He said, “He who is not for Me is against Me”
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Headin’ for another joint
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
He saw an animal up on a hill
You never understood that it ain’t no good
Which opened up his heart
The judge, he holds a grudge
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
			Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
If I had wings and I could fly
Queen for queen
Romeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion
If she ain’t feelin’ well
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
That keep us so tightly bound
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
Her mouth was watery and wet
You ever seen a ghost? No
“I’ve had too much of your company,”
You hand in your ticket
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive
Introduced as friends
Between stayin’ and returnin’
It was raining from the first
All the rest of them rebel rivers
Did they know right then and there what the power was worth?
Now his nurse, some local loser
Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown
Don’t wanna be a bum
It's been so long
It’s the top of the end
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Some things last longer than you think they will
That was really shook
That’s hangin’ on the wall
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
By insurance men who go
Oh, even that couldn’t make me go back
Let me see what you got
I can see that your head
Walkin’ to and fro beneath the moon
It’s you and you only I been thinking about
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?										 
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train
I’m here to create the new imperial empire
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Don’t the sun look good
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
I don’t want to meet your kin
With great lawyers you have
But deep inside my heart
May your feet always be swift
Comin’ down the road for a country mile or two
But you have heard of them
Goodness hides behind its gates
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved
But nobody can sing the blues
But the town has no need to be nervous
Makes you stop and all wonder why
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
It's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Remember me to one who lives there
Honey, I want you										 
I got no choice
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
If your mem’ry serves you well
Guess it’s too late to say the things to you
I’m a-goin’ back out ’fore the rain starts a-fallin’
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Well, they’re doing the double shuffle, throwin’ sand on the floor
It doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”
Would treat a father so
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
Wherever you roam
Then she opened up a book of poems
And she also keeps the cards that read
But you’re always what I’m thinkin’ of
Unless you’re happy too
But you know that we shall meet again
Call me for dinner, honey, I’ll be there
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you										 
This kind of love; I’m love sick
An’ evidently she won’t
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
Do you, Mister Jones?										 
Just take everything down to Highway 61
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
You will not hear a laugh
And the ancient empty street’s too dead for dreaming
Ev’rybody watchin’ us go by
’Cause I believe in you										 
Don’t say I never warned you
That you’re tired of yourself and all of your creations
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship
To her, death is quite romantic
Swords piercing your side
The cat’s in the well and grief is showing its face
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I say it so it must be so 
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
“His Master’s voice is calling me”
I’d gladly confess
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
And salt for salt
Won’t even say what it is I’ve got
But all I care about now
Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee
The fire's gone out but the light is never dying
No knife could ever cut our love apart
True love can make a blade of grass
I’m all dressed up, I’m going to the county dance
Señor, señor, let’s disconnect these cables
You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
They all got out of here any way they could
Then you turned up again
Ever gonna take the place of you
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
			I got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense
Cares not to come up any higher
God knows how to make it flow
People on the platforms
I’d ask him what the matter was
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within
Bring that bottle over here
Coffins droppin’ in the street
And they lived in an alley under the red sky
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
A foreign sound to your ear
“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Can’t buy a thrill
“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”
Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
In the ruins of your balcony
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs
In the dark I hear the night birds call
Grandpa died last week
The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face
What can I do for You?										 
Throw my troubles out the door
And old men turning young daughters into whores
Can strut their feathers well
Please see if she’s wearing a coat so warm
Or define you or confine you
Have they counted the cost it’ll take to bring down
I could offer you a warm embrace
Babe, I’d lay awake all night
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
That you’d have liked me to
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
Full of emptiness and wrath
I’ve heard you say many times
It’s bad out there
As the last fire truck from hell
The chance won’t come again
That light I never knowed
Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one
But I could not get across
Is Cinderella sweeping up
I gotta go
God knows it’s out of sight
Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
No one on earth would ever know
He’ll teach you how to pick and choose
By His strength I do endure
Now, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
If you’re a doctor, I need a shot of love										 
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden
Sweet Melinda
How is it you come to be this way?”
Nations are angry, cursed are some
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
He’s not sentimental—don’t bother him at all
Than a place for you to stand
From the boat I fish for bullheads
Down to New Orleans
But I would never do you wrong
All that foreign oil controlling American soil
I can tell you are torn
You’re a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
Don’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
Things come alive or they fall flat
I had to leave there in a hurry
You only got ten
Gonna break the roof in—set fire to the place as a parting gift
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
I was hungry and it was your world
Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat
Though I cannot explain that in lines
Silvio
I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Brag about it all over town
It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun
Working as a cook for a spell
Who says she knows me well
I’m rollin’ slow—I’m doing all I know
Talkin’ that the heat put
It’s rough out there
So I drifted down to New Orleans
I’m just going
And now the heart is filled with gold
Sometimes must have to stand naked
Every day you got to pray for guidance
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows 
Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
I’m gonna spare the defeated—I’m gonna speak to the crowd
The rats have got your flour
And on their promises of paradise
True love needs no company
My love she laughs like the flowers
What price I pay 
And your pleasure knows no limits
I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
I’ll tell you something, things you never had you’ll never miss
			They sat together in the park
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say 
Not much happenin’ here, nothin’ ever does
So it may flow and be
And I’m one too many mornings
You forget all about the golden rule
About the same time He made the earth
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
Everybody get ready to lift your glasses and sing
He’s dressed up like a squire
			When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
She says, “You can’t repeat the past.” I say, “You can’t? What do you mean,
He’ll tell them to you when you’re asleep
Take a woman like you
An’ I have no sense of time
Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
Come out and round up everyone
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
And revolution in the air
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
’Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
No boat's gonna row
Did so many things I never did intend to do
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about
You know I won’t be next to you, you know I won’t be near
Then time will tell who fell
Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose
Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling
Creeping it's way into my gut 
She was workin’ in a topless place
Gonna leave a greasy trail
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys
When men will beg God to kill them and they won’t be able to die?
As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
But it looks like you won’t
How many times must a man look up
If I can't have you,
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
I been hangin’ on threads
From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
			Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re trying to be so good
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill
They say that you’ve been seen with some other man
			Well, if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Don’t let me drift too far
May you stay forever young										 
You used to laugh about
Last night the wind was whisperin’, I was trying to make out what it was
Or you don’t dance at all”
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more										 
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew										 
Among the lumberjacks
I’m just going down the road feeling bad
At ships with tattooed sails
			A worried man with a worried mind
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day
From fixtures and forces and friends
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
			Just like old Saxophone Joe
I’m going to do whatever circumstances require
As someone who has had you on his mind										 
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
But this ol’ river keeps on rollin’, though
It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
They walk among the stately trees
I became withdrawn
My old man, he’s like some feudal lord
I can’t tell my heart that you’re no good
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
On a hot summer day, hot summer lawn
And the mother had to turn her face away
I believe in you even though we be apart
And I was standin’ on the side of the road
Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Sets my heart a-reeling
And he screams back, “You’re a cow
			The seasons they are turnin’ and my sad heart is yearnin’
“just because”
It’s gettin’ dark, too dark for me to see
I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose
Newspapermen eating candy
Making you feel
Man gave names to all the animals
Holding a blossom on a stem
They got some hungry women there
You’ve been fooled into thinking
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
They say low wages are a reality
I don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes
Funny, how the things you have the hardest time parting with
			As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
Everything is broken										   
And hide it in your case
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Except hatred
You should be made
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Timber two-foot-six across
Yet it’s hard t’ think on
Precious angel, you believe me when I say
We laughed and had a good time you and I
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
At seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand
Have fallen from her curls
Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
The country doctor rambles
There's a crash on the levee
I’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t heal
From the thirteenth century
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
And though her eyes are fixed upon
God knows there’s a purpose
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
Each one wishing for what the other has got
All I ever do is struggle and strive
Rabbit runnin’ down across the road
What does it matter 
Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new
That he not busy being born is busy dying
I’ll always thank the Lord
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
			You walk into the room
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin
Is that I’m seeing the real you at last
An’ wouldn’t it be my luck
It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”
His voice it trembles as he calls out
But you don’t understand
Deciding America’s future from Amsterdam and to Paris
The bridge at midnight trembles
Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain
Who knows, baby
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ’em bad enough
As the evening sky grew dark
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
Foundationed deep, somehow
Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?
I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
“Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
Get jailed, jump bail
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
Tie me on ’er and turn her loose
To hold me in your arms
They’re taking a street car named Desire
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Thinkin' ‘bout that gal I left behind
My bewildering brain, toils in vain
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too
Walking through the cities of the plague
The world has gone black before my eyes										 
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
Speak jealously of them that are free
Eatin' hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town
While I was sleeping
			Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Your grass is turning black
And I’ve never gotten used to it, I’ve just learned to turn it off
I got love for you and it’s all in vain
Outside, the crowd was stirring
			In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
Broken buckles, broken laws
One look at you and I’m out of control
T’ deal with the dyin’
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
			Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
People are expecting a false peace to come
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I am not askin’ you to say words like “yes” or “no”
And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
The midnight rain follows the train
My love she speaks softly
And it’s all over now, Baby Blue										 
But I don’t sense affection
By worthless foam from the mouth
I know the reason
But by faith in Him who called
No one in front of me and nothing behind
But fire next time
A saxophone someplace far off played
I met a young woman whose body was burning
But you don’t know what it is
He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide
And your long-time curse hurts
When it's time to go you got an open door
Just do your thing, you’ll be king
On a South Dakota farm
You might be somebody’s landlord, you might even own banks
Junk is piling up, taking up space
I’m just breathin’ to myself, pretendin’ not that I don’t know
Big Joe Turner lookin’ east and west
But it was oh so hard to tell
With some fine young handsome man
Don’t know how it looked to other people
And you say, “Who is that man?”
She was standing in the door
You better go back to from where you came
Ain’t that the way it oughta be?
Vanished from my hand
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
Ain’t no use jiving
Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”
He asked poor Howard where can I go
For the saving grace that’s over me
I'm listenin' to the steel rails hum
But she breaks just like a little girl
An’ anyway I’m not alone
Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rent
She once was a true love of mine										 
People tell me it’s a sin
I’m on the dark side of the road
Find out something only dead men know
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Buy me a flute
They would not let me be
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams 
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
New morning . . .										 
The only thing I knew how to do
And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
Across the swamp of time?
Because he took you for a ride
I won’t throw it up in anybody’s face
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
On top of the hill
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
			Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
At a Baltimore hotel society gath’rin’
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name
To be on your own
If not for you										 
You see, you’re just like me
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
On her twenty-second birthday
But I did it, though, because he lied
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait
Take a deep breath, feel like you’re chokin'
And then he kneels
As you yourself can see
My eyes they start to fade
The handmade blade, the child’s balloon
I traveled through East Texas
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
But to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity
That you needed to hear me say
Horns on his head and they weren’t too short
It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away
So I remember ev’ry face
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
I’d just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Pretending he just doesn’t see?
Am I still dreamin’ yet?
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day 
I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
People bending broken rules
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
Well, you look so pretty in it
Will never buy back your soul
You can bust your feet
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
I can hear that whistle blowin’
This love could tear me in two
All the way from New Orleans
What can I say
Now the preacher looked so baffled
No one t’ defeat you
In the spotlight so clear
Mama, don't you let me down
Oh, Jokerman, you don’t show any response
I wish to God that it were night
Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Forgive what you do
			Well, today has been a sad ol’ lonesome day
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright
