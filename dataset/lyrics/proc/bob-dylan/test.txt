Please tell her thanks a lot
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor
The vagabond who’s rapping at your door
And that which you’ve given me today
The pump don’t work
Yes, I just wanna see
The lover who just walked out your door
What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
We can have a whoppin' good time										 
She speaks good English
Don’t try “No-Doz”
At times I think there are no words
When I paint my masterpiece
You better leave”
You didn’t show no visible scars
			Broken lines, broken strings
He was an outlaw, that’s for sure
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
All his kings
			“Oh, help me in my weakness”
Well, I’m crying to the Lord—I’m tryin’ to be meek and mild
They pass by so silently
Now, I’ve just got to go
It’s not my problem
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
When all of your advisers heave their plastic
So much oppression
All around the cabin door
The stars above the barren trees
Where I can watch her waltz for free
I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame
And climb on every rung
Love that country pie
Using all the devices under the sun
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Got more lives than a cat
But there’s one thing I know
Jesus said, “Be ready
See the primitive wallflower freeze
That can win what’s never been won
Here comes the blind commissioner
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
The flowers of the city
You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy
Railings froze
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down
She’s nobody’s child
Wherever I am welcome is where I’ll be
Took a woman like you
You ought to be a fool about me 
All my loyal and much-loved companions
Six-time losers
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
You could shoot like Belle Starr
And who’s been left behind
You may be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-sized bed
God knows there’s a heaven
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
But users, cheaters
Like a complete unknown
To every conceivable point of view”
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
To make all that should be killed to crawl
It's either one or the other or neither of the two
“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend
Lost your power of recall 
That you wanna hold me
It was supposed to last a season
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
She knows there’s no success like failure
For as long as love will last
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin’ boy she could destroy
But what do you care? Ain’t nobody there would want to marry your sister
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?
It doesn’t haunt me like it did before
I just don’t know what I’m gonna do
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman										 
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
She went with the man
Down every street there's a window
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
By His power I’ve been lifted
At the head of the chamber of commerce
Up the road around the bend
Is your money that good
They’ll stone you when you are walking home
You must know about my debutante”
I won't be back ‘til fall
Oh, what’ll you do now, my darling young one?
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives
It’s either fortune or fame
If you’re lookin’ to get silly
Now, don't you try an' move me
Where the heart-attack machine
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight
I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Don’t let me change my heart
			Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin' to be so quiet?
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound										 
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
Romantic facts of musketeers
I got a letter on a lonesome day
But there’s only one authority
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
In the last outback, at the world's end										  
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
As I look around this world all that I’m finding
And there’s no use in tryin’
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
You can hear them blow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
As I stepped out of the womb
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
But the joke was on me
You’re the queen of my flesh, girl, you’re my woman, you’re my delight
You see somebody naked
I wish my mother was still alive
You're gonna have to find yourself
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
In the pale afternoon
Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse
I’ve been saved
For me He was rejected by a world that He created
You say you’re shakin’
I lived with them on Montague Street
Rolling down the road
Make you spin or do you in
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
To push fake morals, insult and stare
She had to sell everything she owned
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it
I want you, I want you
			Darkness at the break of noon
From the dark room of his mind
But your heart is like an ocean
You want me to believe
Everything passes
Makes you wanna stop and read a book
I’s just about to do the same
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
I always knew
But everybody wants you
Can you tell me what we’re waiting for, señor?										 
And you say, “What does this mean?”
She never stumbles
But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine
He’s going to the carnival tonight
The cat’s in the well and the servant is at the door
I’m younger than that now										 
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
While evening slips away
When the truth’s in our hearts and we still don’t believe?
Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?”
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
Is just equality in school
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
My mule is sick, my horse is blind
You know, I never seen him before
Everybody that was hangin’ out
I could be you
But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray
They all play on pennywhistles
Feel like a fighting rooster—feel better than I ever felt
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I’ll be on my way
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
What made them want to come and blow you away?
What it was that I’ve done wrong”
To the wedding of his son
Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
You say you disturb me
It’s somethin’ you did
Passed this way an hour ago
Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
At your feet to convince you of your pain
What do I care?
Lay your hand upon my head
The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank
			Your breath is sweet
Orders from the D.A.
To be just like them
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls
Nothin' we can call our own
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
I’m not that eager to make a mistake
For so long I’ve been hindered
And he was told but these few words
He didn’t see her anywhere
That he’s in
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
From East to West
You’re very well read
			Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
I can hear them rebels yell
You can’t make love all by yourself										 
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
To be just like I am
If her hair was still red
And because time was on his side
Daddy’s in the alley
No midnight ramblers like they did before
There’s some people that
			Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
Your sister sees the future
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Are the things you need the least
Is when I’m alone with you
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And ask him do you want to make a deal?
And furnish me with tape
A brave man will kill you with a sword, a coward with a kiss
And it’s Eastertime too
Split up on a dark sad night
He’s not a gentleman at all—he’s rotten to the core
You fasten the triggers
Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon
Before she sleeps in the sand?
If dogs run free										 
Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
So many things that we never will undo
I think you will find
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand
Pack up your suitcase
Don’t my gal look fine
Well, the fog’s so thick you can’t spy the land
The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
And then complains
And I know no one can sing the blues
Where I happened to be employed
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
I can't hardly sleep 
			They ask me how I feel
Shake me up that old peach tree
When I left my long-time darlin’
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
Don’t mind the driving rain
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
I’m having a hard time believin’ some people were ever alive
And handed it to me
Upon the street where mothers weep
Tangled up in blue										 
Juliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off
And a thousand miles behind
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
And they really make a mess outta you
They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to keep your seat
They brag about your sugar 
Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
Try hard, get barred
When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
			The man in me will do nearly any task
Well, if you wanna see the sun rise
Though its glow is waxed in black
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
Like the dirty drivin’ rain
In the darkness of my night
Pourin’ off of every page
They don’t want me around
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
Broken words never meant to be spoken
I’m drownin’ in the poison, got no future, got no past
			I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind
Nobody can sing the blues
And I’ve waited all day long
It’s pounding on your brain
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
That Baby’s got new clothes
Bertha Mason shook it—broke it
Some things are too hot to touch
On seven shotgun shells
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
May you grow up to be righteous
Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, I’m using ’em all
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
They say don’t come back no more
But this is ten times worse”
Kick your shoes off, do not fear
Now you don’t seem so proud
Ringing up and down the line
But I’ll sit down on this bank of sand
Moving with a simple twist of fate
Well I got here followin' the southern star
While paupers change possessions
All their earthly principles they’re gonna have to abandon?
When only you are near
On bad terms with the younger men
Without you it's so hard to live  
A self-ordained professor’s tongue
She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
Water's gonna overflow
Well, she talks to all the servants
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men
Some speak of the future
I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
			Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
Well, I’ll sell it to ya at a reduced price
You ain’t seen nothing like me yet
Your empty pockets tell yuh
The Judge is coming in, everybody rise
Who prophesize with your pen
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
When I’m alone with you
That it is not he or she or them or it
Honey bees are buzzin’
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way
That he’s tall, dark and handsome, and you’re holding his hand
God says, “Out on Highway 61”
They waste your nights and days
If your mem’ry served you well
Waiting to find out what price
They’ll stone you when you’re riding in your car
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’
And I wonder
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Said, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing”
You play with my world
The whole wide world which people say is round
Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
And you say, “Oh my God
I’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey—I’ll die before I turn senile
			Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
Hollis Brown
But you I'll remember always
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
The Phantom of the Opera
The answer is blowin’ in the wind										 
And you know it
Well, I don’t deserve it but I sure did make it through
Where I will always be renewed
They’re one day older and a dollar short
Ever since the world began
Social clubs in drag disguise
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'
After poisoning him with words
Well, I’m gonna quit this baby talk now
Then let him have my seat
They never did like Mama’s homemade dress
She lit a burner on the stove
I’m gazing out the window
Anyway it wouldn’t ring true
Without this love that we call ours
Into leaving his post
The Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
I know there is no help I can bring
A world I never knew
Won’t fall upon them naturally
Lookin’ for a new fool
You’d be honest with me, if only you knew
I can’t stay in here
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Folks lose their possessions—folks are leaving town
Wiggle ’til the moon sees you
Behind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of pain
You ain’t worth the blood
I’m closin’ the book
Wants eleven dollar bills
But it grieves my heart, love
Give to me my country pie
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles
Sleep is like a temporary death
To Desolation Row”
High water risin’, the shacks are slidin’ down
To hold each other tight
You left me standing out in the cold
Just what you’ll say
I know a place where there’s still somethin’ going on										 
How many letters they sent
It’s well known
And you know it’s true
I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town
And I’ll go last
It's all true, everything you have heard 
You’ll never be greater than yourself”
Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain’t no neutral ground
They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”
Go melt back into the night, babe
For the wheel’s still in spin
Hear me singin’ through these tears
When there is no more
Down along the cove
Well, God is in His heaven
I’m not sleepy and there is no place I’m going to
An’ he just smoked my eyelids
Mama, put my guns in the ground
Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest
And give them all another name
Oh, what’ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Even though my mind is hazy an’ my thoughts they might be narrow
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
I will only let you down
That sucks you into feelin’ like this
Pay for your ticket and don't complain
I only mean it for the best
Saying, “The sun’s not yellow it’s chicken”
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
At the mongrel dogs who teach
If we want to compete abroad 
Everybody movin’ if they ain’t already there
“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Before he can see the sky?
And charm the whistle off an evening train
And the clouds are weeping
			When your mother sends back all your invitations
Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
Between the windows of the sea
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
I give what I got until I got no more
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Of the St. James Hotel
Born already ruined
I’m going back to New York City
Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true
Your children are so hungry
Join the army, if you fail
You’re a big girl now
Far down the street we stray
To make your time more easy passin’
I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard ’em too
If dogs run free, why not me
They’re an illusion to me now
I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
Take the motherless children off the street 
It only goes to show
I hope that you can hear
Oh, it’s so hard to get on
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
And put us on our way
Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginnin’ to shake
We pointed out the way to go
Forget the dead you’ve left, they will not follow you
“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
About man and God and law
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed
If not for you
He lived on the outside of town
I ain’t lookin’ to block you up
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
Could you ever be true? I think of you
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you										 
Right outside of Delacroix
In a basement down the stairs
And watch the river flow
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Maggie says that many say
I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me
Someone else is speakin’ with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart
I’m gonna tame the proud
She ain’t hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin’ her deep
You can mislead a man
Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime
Most ev’rybody really thought
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
you can’t? Of course you can.”
T’ anything I might’ve tried
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down 
Crumble into one another
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Some on their way up, some on their way down
My pathway led by confusion boats
And life is brief
To get through to the man in me
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I’ll be your baby tonight
Genghis Khan
			I have heard rumors all over town
They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ on the floor
I’m singin’ love’s praises with sugar-coated rhyme
I shall be released										 
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
My dear sweet friend
She’s wearin’ a multi-thousand dollar gown
Ain’t no use joking
How many years can a mountain exist
Because something is happening here
Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind
I’d forever talk to you
But I would not feel so all alone
By His spirit I’ve been sealed
Some are carpenters’ wives
May you always be courageous
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
There’s not even room enough to be anywhere
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Your sorrow does stem
There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary
“It’s his”
For another plate of food
He was tryin’ to create a next world war
Going through all these things twice
When He said, “Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize?
Shock or knock or lock you up
Well, I don’t know how it happened
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had										 
But I can’t get close t’ her at all
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
To find the man in me
Yes, ’n’ how many times must the cannonballs fly
And the sails are spread
And you hide from my eyes
A place where there is no pain of birth
Now won’t you tell me true
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Wiggle ’til you vomit fire
Can't explain 
Yes, ’n’ how many times can a man turn his head
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
But it ain’t me, babe
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen
That are drivin’ me insane
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Everybody is making love
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Twelfth Street and Vine
Made of silver or of golden
And just for that one moment
No, no, no, it ain’t me, babe
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
And says, “How does it feel
It looked like there wasn’t nothin’ that he couldn’t pull
Makin’ love to you
You're just gonna lose
And I’m in the shade
You might say that I’m young
Watch out he don’t fall on you
Politician got on his jogging shoes
You prayed to the Lord above
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, “All is well”
Were his only audience
I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
Now ain’t the time for your tears
I promise to go under it
With a time-rusted compass blade
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
Tell nothing except who to idolize
Ah, but I was so much older then
To stay away from the train line
Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:
Yes, ’n’ how many ears must one man have
And for Christmas, buy her a drum										 
I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather
They’ll stone ya and then they’ll say, “good luck”
Though you just thought it was nothing more
She let go of my hand
Wiggle ’til you’re high, wiggle ’til you’re higher
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I heard her say over my shoulder
The door has closed forevermore 
But I found him there instead
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
Me with my belt
God don’t call it wrong
For she ain’t the same
We’ll climb that hill no matter how steep
I only saw what they let me see
in the same breath
Girls like birds flying away
You looked for work and money
But, oh, what kind of love is this
You can’t rely no more to be standin’ around waitin'
Come to me now, you know
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Then they bring them to the factory
It hurts me all over, it doesn’t seem right
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
And is buried in the mud
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
As human gods aim for their mark
To understand you know too soon
I hope you’re satisfied”
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
Look out the saints are comin’ through
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
I just want to thank You, Lord
Give me some milk
Wiggle ’til you wiggle right out of here
Please don’t let on that you knew me when
When I was down
They say that you’re planning to put me down
If you don't like it you can leave me alone
			High water risin’—risin’ night and day
They just stand around and boast
Yes, I’m so glad
Hear that undertaker’s bell
Spanish boots of Spanish leather										 
Shadows even the silver spoon
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues										 
Comes to call at times you least expect
Good and bad, I define these terms
By His hand I’ve been delivered
I can see through your masks
Then come back and see you
Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again
But goodbye’s too good a word, gal
Another day
Your cracked country lips
You have laid down Your life for me
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse
The bright spark of the steady lights
Jesus is calling, He’s coming back to gather up his jewels
Crying like a fire in the sun
I can't go to paradise no more
No gratitude or love
I’m paintin’ the town—swinging my partner around
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
You've numbed my will
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
Gate won’t close
The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed
“My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
Now, you can train on down
Don't know what to do without it
But don’t think twice, it’s all right										 
That carry around a fire hose
Of ev’ry man who put me here
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
We’ll just have to see how it goes
Watchin’ the river flow
’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight
All nonbelievers and men stealers talkin’ in the name of religion
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
Goes rolling by
She knows where I’d like to be
When I’ve forgotten all the rest
At the close of the day
What good am I then to others and me
You’re the reason I’m trav’lin’ on
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
You know you got
I keep thinking about you baby 
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
She ain’t got no shoes
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud
A thousand miles from home
Is there anyone that cares?
Of two mules, trains and rain
His closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand
To curbs ’neath holes where babies wail
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I hurt easy, I just don’t show it
If your time to you is worth savin’
Well, I’ve been to London and I’ve been to gay Paree
Yet there’s no one to beat you
May your song always be sung
There’s a rumbling in the skies
Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’
That can ever be hurled
As great as you are a man
So if you’re travelin’ in the north country fair
Get away from these demagogues
And puts her hands in her back pockets
People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall”
He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound
I met a white man who walked a black dog
Baby I am the king and you're the queen										 
I’m not the one you need
As they carried him from the courtroom
There’s not much more to be said
Old memories of you to me have clung
Goin’ down over the sea?
And don’t speak too soon
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Seems like I been down this way before
And nobody has to think too much
			In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
What good am I?
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on
The night blows cold and rainy
What you can’t understand
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
Walkin' ever since the other night
In the long black coat										 
And watch the river flow										 
By the saving grace that’s over me
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Until one day he just appeared
It's just as plain as it can be
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm movin' along
At dawn my lover comes to me
Ain’t it clear that—
My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet
May you always do for others
For her I feel so afraid
Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
You knew that we would meet again
“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”
Ever since we’ve been apart										 
			Hollis Brown
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
			Spirit on the water 
So glad
“Can’t you see I’m drownin’ too?”
And you turn and run farther
But like Louise always says
But your love just hasn’t proved true
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
What can I do for You?
I'll sell ‘em to their enemies
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Into the ditch of what each one means
As if it was a purse
Well, I have had some rotten nights
High on the hill 
Don’t wanna be with nobody tonight
			You took a part of me that I really miss
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Mama, don't you make a sound
I still wish to kiss
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
That I done it the way
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Saddle me up my big white goose
Meantime life outside goes on
Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down 
Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face
			Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
You're always on my mind 
You're the only love I've ever known
When I met you, baby
And I thought of you
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake
Baby I am the king and you're the queen
It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall										 
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn to cry awhile
When someone attacks your imagination
ALTERNATE VERSION
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
An’ I gaze back to the street
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
But still remains
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles
Check to see that nobody is escaping
With you perfectly
But everybody still talks about
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
You’ve never learned to read or write
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
Oh! what would I do
Quicker than anyone I knew
That while life’s pleasures be few
I believe in you when white turn to black
I’ve been wading through the high muddy water
When he’s got the hogshead up on his toe
And the mailbox is locked
I know I can’t escape
From across that lonesome ocean
The cold rain can give you the shivers
Don’t follow leaders
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
I can hear a lover's breath
Where the neon madmen climb
When I left my home the sky split open wide
Ring bell, hard to tell
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Is strapped across their shoulders
There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
An’ now people just get uglier
I met a young child beside a dead pony
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Anyway they already expect you
The branches cast their shadows over stone
“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
Get sick, get well
I wouldn’t pay it any mind
I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives
And his cabin fallin’ down
When she’s comin’ after me?
Real dirty face and a curly tail
I know I will sustain
No one can ever claim
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
			You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
She knows too much to argue or to judge
There’s a million reasons for you to be crying
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike
And if I don’t make it
Well, I heard that hoot owl singing
You say, “How are you?” “Good luck”
Your grass it is turning black
But rather get you down in the hole
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
But the mountains of the past
God knows everything
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup
Throw my suitcase out there, too
He really wasn’t where it’s at
There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
Didn’t think that they would pass
The world has gone black before my eyes
Slip away										 
Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away
And my happiness is o'er
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
I’ll remember you
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
And he says, “How?”
			The air is getting hotter
And now I know you’re dissatisfied
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind
When the roses fade
To know and feel too much within
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
You do so at the peril of your own life
It ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
Everybody must get stoned										 
Where many martyrs fell
Sugar Baby get on down the road
There’s seven breezes a-blowin’
All the gold and silver are bein' stolen away
Ain’t goin’ nowhere fast
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
With his memories in a trunk
Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
You’re a big girl all the way
I know they're not what they seem
If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
			Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith
God knows it’s true
And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
An’ it ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe
But you’re gonna have to serve somebody
The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star”
You don’t need a weatherman
Rain fallin’ on my shoes
Only a matter of time ’til night comes steppin’ in
I was going down for the last time
You are a walking antique
I’m just thankful and grateful
You don’t forget
I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud
And you don’t deserve me
The storms are raging on the rollin’ sea
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
Overturn these tables
Although the masters make the rules
Nobody has to guess
I’m in love with my second cousin
You could have done better but I don’t mind
