'Cause I got a whole lotta hits and no tricks
boom,boom,boom let it thump in the truck.
The game don't stop
I gotta turn this nigga out
Still get paid to bust the right shit
Lost a few pounds and my whips for ya
Gimme that, gimme that
You must respect this lady Damn I'ma make you dance, you dance I'm a triple threat
Where my drum majors? Pull out your bullhorn
Please do not try to fuck with young duck
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak
Then you make a stank face
Yea yea yea yea
If they want to brawl Missy give me a call
If you want to battle let there be no more delayin' I hope you did some praying cause when I come swayin'
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
I'm Missy on the microphone
One verbs be frightening
55, 65, hike
WOOOOOO! Ahh daddy! Ooooo! Ah! Oh, ooh!
It's so hard hard hard that you barely in your ? Mi-mi-Missy and I and I we we music ?
