The pop community I mean these bitches come with union fee
Why do I mention the solar system

And well do anything when the times right
Single black female addicted to retail and well

And I wrote this just to say Im sorry
My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
The crowd is open I think I know why
Niggas dont take shots at us that is only obvious
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
When I go raw I like to leave it in
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
I heard he bought some coke with my money
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Twothousanddollar bag with no cash in your purse
Flashing lights the stress of life
And I thought you could wait
If a baller come around she gone smile for the change
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me fore I embarrass you
Until the hits that I came with
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Might have caught you clappin every Sunday at church
This is family business

And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
When I pack my bags
The only thing I wish I wish a nigga would Welcome to the good life
Came to see me in my black skin black
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Im living three dreams Biggie Smalls Dr King
If you aint no punk

You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
Now this weed drank got me faded
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
told me they fuck with me in the Bay pimp
Look back on my life and my life gone
To let me figure out this wasnt my place
Except without the titties
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
My dick out can she suck it right now
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
Besides what the pastor say I have to say
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight

Never meant to hurt you I shouldve had nights off

Nigga peeune peeune peeune

But for that Benz I get CL love
Cause you in my soul and system
First song they played for me was bout their friend that just died
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Ay bitch you missed out fomo
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus Ross grunt
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
You muthafuckers stay right there

Everybody gon say something

And she got that ass I got to look sorry
Colin Powells Austin Powers
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
You know some other shit I hate wwwhat
Up in the morning miss you bad

Make rash decisions oh she do it
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin up
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
Most imitated Grammy nominated
Yall niggas cant fuck with Ye
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
Since Michael Jackson made Rock With You
Where I wanna go I dont need you
Activated Im back to Vegas
So Imma need a little more time now
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove cause
Im in love with you but the vibe is wrong
Bad bitch you dig that
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Im about to hit the Ye button
Lets get lost tonight
You just trying to find where the tissue is
Now aint that about a bitch
Its like I dont even know ya
If I walk up out of Saks Fifth
Andor something more than just a backseat
Restraining order cant see my daughter
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
Try to catch it gasps its kinda hard
Got a hotel room stars for you
If its classic its gon last forever then
She brace herself and hold my stomach good dickll do that
But I bet them Polaroidsll send her down memory lane
I said Look you need to crawl fore you ball
But then I blessed them with that Polo
As soon as I did all the Bullshit was deaded
I dont wanna have to check you
Eighteen years eighteen years
When she walked up out the dressing room the store just froze
That aint right girl
Uhm well cutie I like your bougie booty
Cause we had it we was magic
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
I got em chillin in the cooler
We messin with Grammies we messin with Oscars
That lean got us dozing we forget that we the chosen
Now tell me when to go tell me where the hoes
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
But when he get low he gon need your ass
I knew that I couldnt cop a coup with no coupons
We hit the city the old me goin OC
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
Ive been saying how I feel at the wrong time
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
Cause I want to be on Park pushin a Benz
Since the tight jeans they aint never liked you
Baby Im magic tada
These niggas aint ready for action
Whats your addiction Is it money Is it girls Is it weed
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
Why dont you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
Blow the back out til you backless
Whats in front Benzes What else Lexus
I got a big ego hahaha
Niggas is loiterin just to feel important
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Ought to blow just like a chick givin oral yo
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
Will explode cause I am the shit and this is my commode
I am a god
But I remember the brain here go a fare for the train and
So Im late as a motherfucker colored people time
Trick that on Armani Emporium its more important though
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
That if you look at my life I guess hes talking back
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Things we buy to cover up whats inside
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
Keep it on the roll only God knows
Late for the class in the hallway nigga
They be drug testin yo ass and then they pray you dont pass
Fake bitches no love what the fuck you take me for
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
You in my freak dreams
When you aint always wrong
Spanish chick grab my chain says is that HeSus
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
What is you talking man That aint important
Okay I dont remember where we first met
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
Even when somebody go away turn me up
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
Hes got his trust fund saved
But this is a whole new arena
You the number one trophy wife
You aint figured out what Im about yet
Niggas talking real reckless stuntmen
Who standing next to B
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch huh
But he just cant seem to get Kanye fresh
Let up the suicide doors
Same problem my father had
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
That know we get Os like Cheerios
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I know its late and I took all year but
If people dont hate then it wont be right
They prolly all in the Hamptons
You been around me long enough
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
I might walk in Nobu wit no shoes
I dont need her right now
So the respect is due like my Louie back
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro

Lets exchange Angels
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
Shouldnt you know that I use to come through wanna
Ill make that bitch Katrina
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
Pass me bottles champagne procession
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
Im not loving you way I wanted to
Maybe one day girl we can bone
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
And still gonna eat the filet mignon
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers
So many lines you photograph and it make arms break
Yeah high inch stilettos with the toes open
You gon see lawyers and niggas in Jordans
I feel like its still niggas that owe me checks
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Jump in the crowds
What the fuck was you saying
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
Mr Fresh Mister by himself hes so impressed
While niggas straight disrespectin him
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
I gotta figure out what Im finna wear
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
She aint really bad she a photo thot
Im back in your life
Trying to stay recession free
I know you gon be mine because ooh Im psychic
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
Lesson learned lesson learned
And you had made cash
My favorite
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
Good morning look at the valedictorian
And you would give anything in this world
With my tuxedo
Dont do no press but I get the most press kit
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
See I wanna move but cant escape from you
Every year gon be our year every year gon be my year
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
Its aiight but it aint Ralph though
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
And you turn off your iPhone
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something
Brother Protect her the best way that you know

Last month I helped her with the car payment
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas huh

LaFace says she like Mase but she love Face
Cause when we cut Im razorbladin

Dropped The Dropout and blazed em

Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Always rockin that this aint out yet
You see it all in my veins like varicose
Told her I aint paying tonight Im only browsing
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh

We going crazy and I always use my best sense
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I dont sweat it wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
So next time you see me on your fallopian
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
That goin to that owin money that the court got
Never listen to Hollywood producers

They take me to the back and pat me
First class with the seat back I still see ya

My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
Cause every summer
