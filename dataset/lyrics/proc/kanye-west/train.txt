Of our imagination MTV cribs

Check out all my kids that bought all my cribs
Every time I breathe on a track I asthma attack it
How could a goddess ask someone thats only average
How could you be so Dr Evil
Feelin on a girls ass with a troubled past
Early morning cartoon shit black
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize

One last announcement
Mr West now can you get any more fresh now
We been through shit you cant make up
After all of that you received this
Yall cant match my hustle

Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
Chillin in the lobbies

The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Why A little rain never hurt no strippers

See theyll confuse us with some bullshit
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
Before I break now ah ah ah ah

When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I aint no pastor dont do missionary
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
﻿Let the suicide doors up

Million dollar renovations to a happy home
Like Pamela Andersons career
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms

Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
The boss is testing yo ass the fedsll question yo ass

You got a new friend well I got homies
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
He come home he from the street

Brothers cant hack it
Cause niggas gonna clown you
You know the pretty ones in that dumb class

Our sex wasnt ordinary drugs
She said Know what grow up you nasty
Thank God almighty they free at last
But since they all lovers I need more rubbers
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth

Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Then we rolled to the movies you rocked your fake Chloes
Tell em to save the hate well be home soon
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on

Especially when you got family members on payroll
Had a little beef I had to aim its stainless steel

Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo

Made to make niggas fail

Mae said cmon Mike said chamone
People asking him do you have any grey poupon
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Keep the work at my baby mamas mamas house
With the Grey Poupon anything Ye poop on
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
What you mean baby girl I got homes

He wants his breakfast in bed
Wait is it because we on the moon
See you know my style
They throwin hate at me
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
The lies get exposed soon as you win it
When you go to sleep What do you think bout

Right now they got that number one spot do you want that want that
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
Put and together and a little bad weather
But only an asshole can give you this much shit
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Ive been down this road too many times before
You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jesse Jackson classy
So Imma ride down with the dos open
Never know enough til its over love
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
Just touched down in London town ha

Everything I throw up blow up
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Theres a thousand yous theres only one of me
Call the shrink up they about to go crazy
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
But whos to blame for all these fights

On my bodyguards back like Prince in the club
Claiming Im overreactin
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Aye aye Dream Im too good at this
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
No you a angel you wave Hi to Aaliyah
Just throw this at the end if Im too late for the intro
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
In a life or death situation
All that cocaine on the table you cant snort that
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me

And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
This game you could never win
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private

WHITE its getting late mami

We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
And everybody know shes mine so she extra plugged
One more hit and I can own ya
Would be lost without me
And a nigga still young thats why I have no kids
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
But is it cool to rap about gold
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
And we made a million a minute we made a million a minute
Playing some bball outside of the school and
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
You niggas pussy aint me
Everybody in the club
I know good pussy when I see it Im a visionary
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
On the field Im overreckless on my Odell Beckham
Revealing the layers to my soul

When my girl be around I see you peepin me
And tell me that its random
I am the menorah of this new era
Now we hottest in the streets it aint no discussion
Cop a prada space suit about the stars
No time to do hair
Instead of me she goin go down
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
Apology accepted you aint say it Shoulda said it
Felt like it rained til the roof caved in
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
Errerrerr step back hold up my nigga you suck hold up
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown

Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
My dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids realize
But but I dont think he should Welcome to the good life
But Ive been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now
You could hear the loudest screams
I tell you what to do what to do what to do
Your friends claim Im a player you be lucky to keep me
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
And steal the spotlight like Mr Bentley
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
After that hes just hopeless
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
Lets talk about amnesia
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
They got heroin and cracks man these niggas hot for real
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I dont fuck with fake dudes wearin fake Trues
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but
Makin stupid cash stack it through the roof
You know why It take too much to touch her
Awesome Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Throw your hands in the sky
And I know she like chocolate men
We could have a real freaky food fight
Kanyes just important as Michael Jordan
And her booty is why God invented my balls
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
But the only thing I need to know right now
This is more than just my road to redemption
The feelings dont really go away
And said the church aint got enough room for all the tombs
So I throw them all on the team
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
Always said what the fuck I felt
Some people call that the art of war you know
Im relaxin my feet is up
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
And in The Cell dont drop soap in the showers huh
And I was thinking bout starting up my own school
She aint no hoodrat she aint gotta prove that
Young producer just trying to get his flows off

Got me cursing with the kids in the car
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life
Why is yall
He claim her heart cant take the anaesthesia
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
And its still about the Benjamins
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
She said Yeah I been spendin all day tryin to figure that out
This is the flow that solar eclipses
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
Ill be so faaaaaar up
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Flashing Lights show I live that
She ride my spaceship til she hit the top
Four Seasons take a shower new clothes Im reloaded
He was just playing possum
Everybody brawlin it was all cool
Now she like See thats my cousin on TV
But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin

She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
Yall bout to turn shit up
Taking off on this rocket Yao Ming

Turn the corners in a foreign car
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
Try to Baller Blockus use Absolute Power
Start a conversation like as if
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Uh I wish I could give you this feeling I wish I could give you this feeling
Got staples on my dick why Fuckin centerfolds
Get your own I got Paris he got Nicky he tried to get em a
That could go from bein stripper to a super CEO
And came out of our body
This the real world homie school finished
And we dont care what people say
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
Feeling on her ass feeling so upper class
We were never meant to be baby we just happened
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Before you ask me to go get a job today
In the projects one day to Project Runway
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
While we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man
Nobody can tell me where Im headin
Especially if you ball
Man Jay they dont really want no problems
But when we get together be electric slidin
Its gonna be the death of me
These niggas asswater get the Drano
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
Youre my devil youre my angel

With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
Nah man we need something extra terrestrial
They smile in my face is what I dont like
My guy said I need a different approach
She lookin for her daddy call me Big Poppa
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
She said I would if hell handle biz up in the sheets
Its for yourself thats important
Flow is just the nicest
A monster about to come alive again
Ive been trending years yall a couple days
Is that yo girlfriend I really like her
Get stacks drive cars
But you were suckin a nigga dick the whole time
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Goddamn we made something from nothing
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
You like pi√±a coladas getting caught in the rain
He said yeah you know you got extra hoes
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
Plus all the trips to Rio couldnt have helped
When I park my Range Rover
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Real nigga back in the house again
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
You trippin when you aint sippin have a refill
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
You know that one auntie you dont mean to be rude
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
If you aint poppin shit then why you rap for Haaan
Baby you up uestion mark
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
Everybody know that you love those lights
Piss on your grave piss on your grave nigga behave
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
Prince Williams aint do it right if you ask me
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
You know how this go I diss hoes
You said Fuck that man Im gon tape it
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
And well be the last ones cracking up
She get under your skin if youuh
Oh we gotta have JE sing at the wedding
They say Drive Slow I say I know
Dont sell me apartment Ill move in the lobby
My trophy on that Bound bike I gave you only pipe
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
Just last year Chicago had over caskets
Talked it then he lived it spit it then he shit it
Pray before rain falls the devils are coming
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
All his time all he had all he had
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I wasnt really spitting game I was scrimmaging
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Girl seducers they come in deuces
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
Who the hottest in the world right now ha
Estelle once said to me Cool down down Dont act a fool now now
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
Whole family gettin money thank God for E
Its been a whole lot of hatin again
She need her daddy baby please
Every bouncer every club show her extra love
Its so packed I might ride around
So sister dont let your guard down
But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move
I asked the nurse Did you do the research
Theres been an accident like GEICO
This is dope as is get is to it
You local retard Im the king of the world
Yeah I got some jokes dont I
Fuck what fuck whatever yall been wearin
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
With way less effort cause when you try hard
They say good things come to those who wait
Have the paparazzi doin backflips
Whats that Ye Baby these heels
He said What up Yeezus
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
Start it up huh start it up
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
Yall niggas cant control me
Youve seen the video words over the building
Never was much of a romantic
Yeah the dropout at it as always nigga as always
Yup You love the way Im turnt
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
Spit like a beat box the way the beat rocks
Im tripping on it socks on marble floors Im slipping on it
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
With some lightskinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Fly that you be on
The niggas so fake Im off it
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Aww man made somethin from nothin
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
To the morgue no time soon brethren
Told her she take me back Ill be more supportive
Hold your drinks up like you was celebrating
Reebok baby you need to try some new things
When you first stop caring about your appearance
Im finna take yall back to them better times
These condom rappin ass niggas wasnt ever raw
Every agent I know know I hate agents
Ayo Im sitting on top of the its More Than a Feeling aint it
Thats our cosa nostra
I go the hardest flow so retarded
You my name is Kanye from the Rocafam
Since they aint black when they get money they dont ball out boy
And see
Now I know you not it
Youre dealing with malpractice dont kill a good niggas confidence
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
Then she met No ID and gave me his number
For my theme song black
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
Flyer than a parakeet floatin with no parachute
Your pussys too good I need to crash
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Barbershop playahated momandpop bootlegged it
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey Yo
Goddamn Yeezy how he hit them with a new style
Never to be heard from again
Young and we alive whoo
Outta this world speak for us
We formed a new religion
Lift off lift off takin my coat off
When I fight and you fight we dont fight fair
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
But hey admittin is the first step
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Before we be done for good
Fuck the beat up so bad wont nobody get up on it
Who complain about what he is owed
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
I threw suicides on the tour bus
Get back gimme room room room
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
You grew up on J Lo Timberlands by Manolo now
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
You love me when I aint sober
Man I dont care bout what you felt
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up
You say he get on your fucking nerves
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
Running naked down the lobby
Sorry Im in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
Get away from me fake bitches I cant take the phoniness
My best friends worry bout me
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Aieeah so lonely aieeah
Im almost Raymond
Throw em some Maybach keys
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
And got the nerve to act moody
Bet I got some slippers on bet niggas gon honor it
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Back out the tomb bitch black
She holding out she aint giving to the needy huh
This is the moment grab your Kodak
Me and my cuz and them
We picking up right where we left
Pinkass polos with a fuckin backpack
One cold night in October
Well Ill be double L trying to talk to yall
But cant because you love what I make
I hate niggas but I love your mom
I know some fans who thought I wouldnt rap like this again
We be in the bathroom fuckin like Baby dont get too loud
Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
You a dancer on the camera
Therell always be haters thats the way it is
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
Its what happens when you make shit thats timeless
God damn got a bald fade I might slam
I cant believe Im back up in this muhfucker
They infected with seconds of life left
I was drinking earlier now Im driving
Thats that Holy water sanctified refreshments
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
Told her this rap game is alright Im just getting by
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Still aint learn me no manners
If I knew yall made plans I wouldnt have popped the Xans
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
To know some if we both honest
For the tracks charge around Cnotes
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
Hannibal Lector my American Psycho
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Im versatile Im the poster child

Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance

Ran up outta pills rob that CVS
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped
This is what yall all looking forward to
Shits deeper than The Sleepers
Used to hit the radio them faggots aint let me on
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cuffed up and hosed down pimped up and hod down
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James

Its bout to get hard now
We keep these Gs in an alloy safe
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I told my mama I was on the come up
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
Well thats a pretty bad way to start the conversation
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
What she order fish filet
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
And what I do act more stupidly
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
Public visitation we met at Borders

And held it til the right time
Thank God I aint too cool for the safe belt

To kill the animosity thats in the air

You cant take that all at one time ya gotta breathe
Tonight man I aint in the mood for it
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
Now I dont know what the hell this song is talkin bout

Good morning to ChiTown where my niggas ride down
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
The devil stay testing cause when you chase the pussy its a sin
Cameras flash so much
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
Hopping out the van screams from the fans
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
And thats what intuition is
She on that coke diet

Some say my beats made the Bulls play better

Not knowing the disconnect from the father
Momma pass in Hollywood

Soon as I pull up and park the Benz

You see if you ever wanted to ever be anything
She went from being a strobe light
Fresh air rollin down the window
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and

So I keep it low keep a secret code
Call up DJ Mano shout out Twilite Tone
And when The Workout Plan aint work out man
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
I made mistakes I bumped my head
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up
Chasing yall dreams and what youve got planned
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Im bout to air shit out
I aint here to argue about his facial features
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
But since they all fall in my Palm I take a trio yo
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
And we goin have a hell of a night through the day I made her say
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendies
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
Niggas who drop names is oh so shameless
A Montessori
Cause now theres kids doing grown man biz nigga
And this verse only add to the freshness
For my lady
