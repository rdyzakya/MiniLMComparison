No I won't cry The daffodils, the sorry candlelight
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares
The virtue of your style inscribed
The night is a starry dome
The good slaves love the good book
He has heard her off to starboard
And then you get the tears
Play them high or lowly
When you're this weak
My whole life has been
You sing for your friends and your family
Rev for stride
And we are twins of spirit
By the second refill
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Chilly now
Run down till the rain delights you
Sequences of mass and space
A thunderhead of judgment was
And put up a parking lot Don't it always seem to go
I came out two days on your tail
And put them in a tree museum
And he mirrored me back simplified
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet Richard got married to a figure skater
So what-
Through midday sidewalk traffic
I found someone to love today Dark with darker moods is he
Not one anxious voice
Only a river of changing faces
In the forest of the night The moon shed light
I asked myself when you said you loved me
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Still a lot of land to see
Blindness, blindness and sight
It was all so light and easy
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car
With enchantment on your side Popcorn, popcorn, cotton candy
Morning's just the same I'd like to buy you everything
Another dream over the dam
And if you care, don't let them know
I'm sitting in some cafe
Orbiting around the sun
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon Oh, won't you stay
But for the work I've taken on
Cities under the sand
And the looks you love
Cry for us all, Beauty
Just another hard-time band
I was crazy
Dancing outside a black bar
He is bleeding from the war
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday
The king's on the road
Sweet fire calling
As every fairy tale comes real
Me and them lonesome blues collide
You can make it thru these waves
Back to the garden I'm traveling in some vehicle
When the tractors come? [Chorus] Sun pity me
Ladies in gingham still blush
Fighting among ourselves
And you even forget to ask
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
These tumors of the skin
Everybody's gonna name
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
In this prisoner
As if by my weak faith
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
After being up all night
And there is a song for you
Or maybe it's the time of man
Not one wet eye around her
Dark cafes
Till I started analyzing
Fortunes and their fame
There's a sign up on the awning
That went on in my head
Gravel under the belly plates"
I got two
Fire and ice So if there's one rule to this game
No, no
Lakota
Devil of delight
Lovers in anger Block of Ice
And put up a parking lot They took all the trees
And not another girl in town
Or do you really feel it?
He says "Bring that bottle kindly
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
The balance is undone, crazy ions
When there's no need to explain
In a room full to mirrors
Is, find another lover When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
They're cutting down trees
So you sign all the papers in the family name
And Jack behind his joker
This jealous lovin's bound to make me
Some mark of in between
You're nobody's fool
Go like virgins to the grave
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Constant stranger
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards
With an ancient crown to fight Truth goes up in vapors
You're a fool if you can't keep cool
They're just souvenirs
And coming to people's parties
At a North Dakota junction
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
Wonder makes it easy
I feel like that black crow
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
The weekends drive me mad
Diggin' the deadly quotas,
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
You put here in this Eskimo
We were newly lovers then
Only when you walk by
Now you know what you need"
You sat up all the night and watched me
Far from the undertow
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head
Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees I'm porous with travel fever
There is danger and education
A course of grace and havoc
It has the head of a man
Concrete concentration camp
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
I went to every wedding in that little town
Of the Magdalene laundries Prostitutes and destitutes
I'm so hard to handle
You know, drinkin' alone's a shame (It's a shame it's a crying shame)
Day by day
If you've got too many doubts
Over virgin wilderness
I said a week, maybe two
And the painted ponies go up and down
(Into no mind)
My parents got frantic
Why do they call this heartless place
I tried to run away myself
Where a local band was playing
The spirit of this world
Get out of town
Like a mother
Sunny Monday
Don't whine
He said "Will lighten up your heavy load"
To the power plants
She was a cheeky girl
You despise
But I'm not that easily led
But you know life is for learning
Formula music, girly guile
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And I was bought and sold
Aging children, I am one Some come dark and strange like dying
There was nobody calling me up for favors And no one's future to decide
I've got the apple of temptation
Keeping us tied and true no, my old man
That's the day she'll leave
About whitewalls and windshields
Come in from the cold I know we never will be perfect
The rapist in the pool
I ain't asking for no full length mink
I love you Blue
The taste of the spray he takes
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine Oh star bright, star bright
I wish I had a river so long
And I took a look at his license plate
Like a statue in a park
Love I was in an all night movie
Morning's just the same We'll find a table in the shade
Love is kind!-
Find yourself a girl, go and settle down
I was raised on robbery My old man he's a singer in the park
Way up here
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Restless sweeps like fire and rain
And he trembles as he sings
On a promise to be free
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
In the woodlands, footprints of the deer
And these rocks and these cactus going by
I'll even kiss a sunset pig
Tell me grandfather
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
You can feel it out in traffic
When your spirits start to sink All this talk about holiness now
Before the first snowflakes sail
The old man is snoring
We can't return, we can only look behind
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
With his eyes turned out of town I have, and I kissed him
It was just plane shadow to train shadow
Even if good fortune allowed Like a priest with a pornographic watch
Oh will you take me as I am?
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and I'll bolt my wandering in
While he showed her all the flowers
The hissing of summer lawns There's a crow flying
You were walking kind of faded
Restitution, what good can it do?
Come out for a visit here
We had to dance a foot apart
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate
I hope you got your heat turned on baby
What strange prizes these battles bring
Like a promise to be free
Looking at money man,
Or a strong cat without claws
I'm like a black crow flying
And the weak suffering what they must?
Of some duality
He will find it hard to shake her
(You can't tame the tiger)
All his sea dreams come to me City satins left at home I will not need them
To that Ethiopian wall Anima rising
Drawn to all things
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild
I'd just walk out those doors And wander
You are a holy man
Nothing left to lose
You're a coward against the flesh
I feel like I'm losing mine
And lovely landscapes to discover
She always makes you welcome in
Oh pity me I heard it in the wind last night
From "Breakfast Barney"
With heaven full of astronauts
The roll of the harbor wake
And we laughed how our perfection
Summer serenade
And stare up at the stars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
There's the one who's thinking of her
And the streets are paved with passersby
There were good times in the cities
He can miss her just the same
Mother
But not like we love our freedom I am on a lonely road and
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas
I'm in trouble again
Call her green and the winters can not fade her
Please come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Please
Waving for you
Man to woman
I wanna belong to the living
To two little dancers
Like the angel made of tin
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching Fly silly seabird
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
But when the leaves fell on the ground
From where we came
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
Kissing in cars, kissing in cafes
And diving, diving, diving, diving.
These hectic joys-these weary blues
And she gathers flowers for her home
"Come with me
When I hear little david playing
Underneath the jungle gym
And a sweet-taIking-ladies man
And I told him, "They don't take chances
When you walk by
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend
Billion year old carbon
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win
Not in iniquity
The bullet and the fence, broke Lakota
In a cobblestone sea
I've had no one over me
Come in from the cold I feel your legs under the table
Will glitter for them so I guess I seem ungrateful
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer, and he pushed
Oh you taste so bitter
To the blackness
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
In morning, Morgantown Morning Morgantown
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down
And catches his silver-fine
It was insane
Can you wake me?
Bright and sweet
Before I came to
When I spotted six jet planes
And I want him to be manly
To see, who in the world I might be I am from the Sunday school
Well there're so many sinking
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Even the war and the navy
Be cool
But your heart's still smoking
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
They won't give peace a chance
Get out of town. I was an unmarried girl
May your dreams come true
Courts that circumvent, choke Lakota
Too many promises the days have broken So I won't cry for kisses out of reach
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
For so many years
(When the moon shines)
I know you don't like weak women You get bored so quick
Night ride home I love the man beside me
Now I sit up here
And he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator
Now I am surf rising
The streetlight's still burning
While he's racking up his free play
Freedom scribbled in the subway
Fractions in me
There's the one who writes her letters
And my search for love
"Come with me I know the way" she says
Now he's diving down
But tomorrow he'll be lonely lonely
They'd like to drive us down the drain
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-
Weary of lies you're sending home
I was a hopeful in rooms like this
Words like, when you're older, must appease him
And I asked him, where are you going
She patrols that fence of his
Who did the goat dance very well
Scalloping the sea
I'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band
With a joyful mask
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
They're putting up reindeer
You punched are dreaming
You know my keys won't fit the door
Or envious-
Keeps me in this tourist town Come on Carey get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
The ulcerated ozone
I had a brain
Or punishing somebody
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads Turning and turning
Will you?
He's got another woman down the hall
Every time you skin her all things weep
Nothing seems to keep you high
Like an empty spotlight Once in a while
There's the hope and the hopelessness
Wearing western boots and buckskin on
I got religion through and through David he would send them notes a-flyin'
Invented this fourth of July
Tiger, tiger burning bright
From two dozen states
I was raised on robbery I'm a pretty good cook
Coming from the cold I am Lakota!
Here is a shell for you
They're playing, Goodbye baby, Baby Goodbye,
Come in from the cold (come in, come in)
Which incendiary soul
All his sea dreams come to me Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
Boring!
Standing water
But be prepared to bleed Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine
And papers lie
Or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly
We are golden
Ooh, love is gone
No we'll never sell
Down to you
I saw a back crow flying
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play No regrets, Coyote
At the miseries made of love
I appeared a little bit wild
Come in from the cold Is this just vulgar electricity
Through the sharing of the profits
And I came out to the "Big Apple" here
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
Are falling on a pay phone by the road
On a storefront mannequin
Two hundred years on hold
Off the farms and the streets
I'm gonna tell you again now
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Choose her a name she'll answer too
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
I was a free man in Paris
Below my window You look so youthful
Whether you do or you do not resign
Since the day they said goodbye
Laughing it all away I met a friend of spirit
And a dream of a baby
Night ride home Hula girls
Just when you're thinking
With a gaze as blank
He'd be singing "Bye, Bye, Love"
Darn right
They'll tell you where to go
From the company
He said I was the type
I could skate away on The way I see it, he said
You know I've been to sea before
And we'll have some laughs
Now I can't talk to you baby
Darkness
None are thin and all are fat
Off to the airport
Just like Nat King Cole
Both of us flirting around
But how can I have that point of view
Oh, be nice, kitty kitty
Morning any town you name
The dizzy dancing way you feel
Within the widening gyre
And good reason to quit him
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
Of all flying things
And the laughing harmonies Songs to aging children come
Is this the edifying fire
And she's so busy being free There's a man who sends her medals
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling "Not so loud!"
Or let me sail away
From coast to coast
And at parties for the press
That shell shocked love away There's comfort in melancholy
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me
"Money" cold shadows reply
On beautiful foolish arms
It seems we all live so close to that line
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars,
He said I'd need treatment
Here comes the midnight cowboy
And your love blessed
There were lots of pretty people there
To prove it I'll have
And caterpillar tractors in the sand
Would always be denied
Was just to come in from the cold (Come in)
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads I pulled off into a forest
May old father time
Oh I love you when I forget about me
I crashed into his arms
She was swallowed by the sky
We're always balancing the power
Love
And you don't like strong women
California, I'm coming home
And this he told me
All these vain promises on beauty jars
So now I'm returning to myself
It's love's illusions I recall
Carrying a cup and a cane
Bridget got that belly by her parish priest
To see, who in the world you might be
Do you really care?
Well, some are going to knock you
Or am I just fighting off growing old
When out of his sight
I gave him clothes and jewelry
And a hawk was playing with him
Your charitable acts
As we siphon the colored language
Your name's in the news
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And you know two heads are better than one Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard
No more ifs or ands or buts They say as a child
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And she lit a candle for my love luck
But it's indistinct
In this moody sky today In our possessive coupling
Those tribute to finality, to eternity
He's too fat from the Bay of Fundy
Fancy French cologne Oh Carey, get out your cane (Carey get out your cane)
I gave him power over me A thousand glass eyes were staring
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Every disc, a poker chip
And the carbon ribbon rides
(You were so kind)
Briefer than a falling star
(Just a flu with a temperature)
Play little david, play David he would sit in some dark corner
Give me spots on my apples
It's cloud's illusions I recall
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Oh, come in from the cold (come in, come in)
Tiger, tiger burning bright Sophia says "It's hard to catch
Put away that D.D.T. now
Only a phase, these dark cafe days When Charlie speaks of Lester
In morning, Morgantown But the only thing I have to give
Shades of Scarlett Conquering
And the faith to move the mountains
And still feel related
Is loosed upon the world Nothing is sacred
And on every metal thorn
The way he described it
No one knows
In flames our prophet witches
We were so anxious to achieve
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life
She says "A woman must have everything"
And so with just a touch of our fingers
Dazzling you, keeping you from your own
So seen you face to face
Calendars of our lives
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
To buy my heart when loveless words were spoken
You're gonna come now
Oh and then you fade so fast
Down and shaken when I think I lose
Like the color when the spring is born
I counted them on my side
And any eye for detail
