Gave me a second chance (second chance)
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
Baby we can get together turn this party out. [Chorus] [Big Tigger]
Had no one to trust
Sometimes I really messed up and you still found a way to hug me (yes you did, lord)
Making future plans, to be where I dwell Half on a baby

And girl I really like your freaky style
Walkin' away, hummin' her favorite song
She was raised in Illinois
Tita's got it
Don't take no bitch to the club when u just met her (My nigga)

Come back, come back,
Therefore I will rise
Open it up see what inside whatever it is put it on

Mr. Kelly help me sing this song [Chorus X2] La la la la la lala la..X3 (fade out)
So I can see sex me baby
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And the coach came to me and had a talk with me about my career
I got a double bed, one's to sleep on
Because the melody is custom made for your heart
Go head' on and break 'em off wit a lil' preview of the remix No I'm not tryin' to be rude,
That's why after we lay, you get to know the real me, yeah
I'm that mountain peak up high
I two way her, she don't hit me back, somethin' is funny So I called her mother's house
And you don't wanna be bothered right now

Arrested in these streets
Prayer changes things (I know prayer is gonna change)
Now let the games begin! That's the sign of a victory
The place is jumping
youre speakin my language, youre speakin my language I'm just bein' real, you know
We will walk and we will walk down the aisle watching our people smile, flowers
She got a man, but that nigga ain't with her
So I hope this paper will travel safely to where you are

Homie lover friend, oh
The other one's to get my freak on, it's all for the (ladies)

She's the only woman (She's the only woman) in the whole wide world

Yeah man that's a way
I can't believe this shit What the hell is goin' on
Said I'm sorry for all the pain that I ever brung to you (oh yeah, yeah)
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel [R Kelly]
I'm forever indebted to her cause When a woman loves
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Oreo, Oreo, like an Oreo
And I'm gonna solve it"
I don't see nothing wrong, hey baby, hey
Take this whole party to my hotel and baby you can bring your crew
Cause I want you,
I shall not fear these streets
When all is darkness,
Said I need someone to satify my every need
You brought us healing
But that's okay, 'cause there's nothing God can't achieve
Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild I was in a tunnel
Lights down, no way
Got so mad at him and
I want y'all to repeat after me
It should be a box with your name
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
And if I get that tonight
This one here's a race where you don't wanna come first
This is, this is number one
And in your eyes I can claerly see it
They got a sight, they got a mind
Uh
And I could be your guy
And raise the flag, yeah yeah
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Your city, my city don't matter, give it up
Because I know, in my heart
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
Through it all, I will stand
But you still didn't judge me
And now until forever, baby, I'll be lovin' you, oh Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby [Repeat: x4] You were always there for me, you know what I'm saying?
Anything your heart desires
It's nothing for me out there in those streets
And almost lost my life
I can make you feel alright
And it's OK, if you want to party night 'til day,
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
After party in my penthouse suite
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
I wish that I could talk to you
Dead in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills
You are my sister
Got each other like la la la la la my baby
Yeah (Said I'm callin' on heaven) Heaven, I need a hug
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
Who know how to follow the rules to this game, alright?
I been looking for love
You're speakin my language(my language)
Prayer changes things (woah)
Ladies sing
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
Holding hands, side by side
Walk the park, holdin' hands or family cook outs (ohh)
Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
Oh like making love to someone you love
I got another bitch comin', gotta clean up
Tell her call a friend up, and if she acts stuck up
You're one in a bill-why-on
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around Though I must admit that things got out of hand
You wanna know how I get down?
I mean right in front of the kids
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt) Yeah
And girl, I promise I will make you my mine Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks

She really did
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
So girl don't be shy
You stepped in ooh save me You saved me You remind me of something
Oh yeah, ain't no pressure
And I can see the sunshine
(did it lift you up?) (yeah)
You see you need someone, someone like me, yeah to make love to you baby constantly I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
Guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
Up and down to a sixty-nine tempo
And I don't wanna make no mistakes at all
Then she comes out and kisses me
Yeah cuddle me in your arms
Through the valley of these blocks
And I promise, I'll be good to you baby
And I call her T.T.
Wash your face, get something to eat Then come back to the bedroom
It makes no difference who you are
I gotta know how, you got the know how
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe
Girl I wouldn't
I know you tryin' to get your freak on too,
Just never forget that every day and night I used to all you (call you, yeah)
Give a damn what you may think of me
In New York meetin' with the realtor
Celebrations, holidays

Just telling my sister how my life is upside down
Then you gave me direction
Here comes this truck now Doctor said don't think he gonna make it

Body like a pinup, I hit it with my chin up
Said, "You can't go this way"
(With you)
Negativity you gotta let go
Groove in the name of love, groove in the name of love (Groove and it's alright) Some believes in love
The weapons that are formed against us

Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
Oh baby
You turn yo head, she wink her eye
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
I can feel it
Putting each other down
And thank our heroes of the past
And she's got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
ONE NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE
Or flex a cooler, while chillin' on the corner Her ex wants to go strollin'
Oh like waterfalls comin' down on me
Ghetto for ya

Come over here and let me take off your clothes
Throw in the towel, no not today

I love you Early one Sunday morning
Somethin' goin' on upstairs, yeah
Uh, uh
piano keys, the melodies
Because I run these streets (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
Celluler rings, somebody wants to borrow money
When a feeling has come over you
Who would have thought she was creepin' with another man
(Here we go my friend)
And maybe those few haters, they'll tag along aight?
And my life has been a smash since you became My number one hit As I lay me down
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine (Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well

You done got way too comfy, baby
Prayer changes (and trouble's chasing you)
My body's callin' for you

Forever honest and true to you
She gave her life to me
No shoes on my feet and
Wanna see me dance
I accepted Christ that day
Oh like tidal wave comin' from the sea

Symphony should be your name
Chip has got it
Hurry up and get in the closet"

Let me see you and your partner stroll Step to the left, step to the right
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
To go all the way, all the way I can smell your perfume
In a bed that don't belong to me
And I know we will survive [Celine Dion]
And what everybody's sayin'
Tryna get you to a hotel
If I could turn back the hands There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you

If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Rise up, rise [Chorus x3] This is a stroy about a man comin' in
But I forget their names
Sing it with me baby
And the walls were in your way
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did
Oh, spirit, spirit
Real talk
Girl you're the mama and I'm the dada
'Cause we all need it,
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
Mm like an Oreo
Every time you put that on my womb You are now rocking with the best
Then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Yeah
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt We playing in my glam in reverse
And pickin' her up is obsolete
Through the valley of these streets
Now, I think you'll better leave this place
He mad 'cause I'm lookin' but I already fucked her
Once I give you some of my (12 play) 12 play Give 'em a little bit
Miracles, so amazed
the crowd goes silent in this place
Who was there when I needed a friend
Protected by these streets Yeah you know I walk
And I've paid my own dues
Baby when I'm fuckin' you
(Heaven is over me)
We were best friends, we put our chips all in (ohh)

'cause where there's a will
(A thousand years from now we'll be still putting it down my baby) Baby girl in other words for ever more
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
We can keep it on the down low (you better keep it, keep it), nobody has to know (nobody knows) Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Ya understand what I'm saying?
Breaking the binds with just a simple song Oh Sadie maiden
La la la la Did you get my card?
New Ghost, new Wraith
You were young, 45, and you had to die
Go Angie, it's your birthday
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
Bouncin' up and down
You took my heart and you set it on fire
(I believe) Yes, I, when the clouds are hanging over
My number one hit The way you put your music on me
Even when it seems, we're goin' through some hard times
I tell ya
You can cry a river
Yeah that's right
(Oh, I believe) Yes, I
You've, you've, you've got that
(She's the only woman in the world for me) Never thought that love could be so kind
And he's so coo
I'll see you again someday
Prayer changes (prayer will calm)
Said, "Woman move out my way"
Spirit filled, heaven praise
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I can't help but stare
When there's pain in my heart [Chorus] la la la la la la la la la Anticipate you grace to stage
The way you got me playin' the field So baby gimme that toot toot
There's still gonna be somebody out there with attitude, right? Right?
Oh like sitting close in a small cafe
Whenever there is darkness, G you brighten up my day
I'm about to hit you with that switch up
And no matter what the cause
Pull up to the crib and a nigga on silk
Bouncin' on 24's
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
But please just don't make my job so hard
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
I can feel the elevation, mmm
It's been nothing but stress
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
Rise, rise up Now I know the burdens that you've had
(I can fly)
Let's step the night away
And anytime that you were hurt
And that's the sign of a victory I can feel the spirit of the nations
Go to work on me babe
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl (She's my favorite girl)
And now that you've come around, to seein' it my way
Earthquaking that ass in denim
A homie lover friend is what I'm looking for
'Cause you are my soul, yeah Girl please tell me where do we go from here
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
Ooh, then beat the pussy til its
The club
And I can sing it all night long I tell you why because, [Chorus] The ghetto is a part of my religion(the only thing my eyes can see)
They takin' shots, now they down for whatever
Prayer changes (at your journey's end)
I'm flyer than yours (haters can't touch me)
Having sex with you is like making hits
The tight mini-skirt you wear
(Oh, I believe) Woo I
Yeah
Ain't nothin' sweeter than you
Can we say a prayer together baby
Anticipation's so crazy
Fuck with a nigga
And after all the things that you have done
Now baby
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
Your gift will be something you will remember
(He's the greatest)At the end of the tunnel
Now that I went from a D all the way to an A plus
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!) [Verse 3]
My body's callin' for you I'm listening baby
What is it that,
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
You're always running of at the mouth telling your girls your motherfucking business, when
While you buyin' her drinks (In the club)
That's why you ass get left behind
After I broke her heart
But I got the good in you, I got the good in you
In time he will provide Will he? Yes he will You just stay in the race Just stay in the race And keep on running And down to the end 'Cause your day is coming The winds, the rain
That means if you love yo chick
He goes up to the closet
Of a strong wind movin? me, mmm
We 'bout to do the damn thing, sing to 'em Kelly. It's alright(it's alright) If you want to come with me
And scream like you want to win
I don't want no more tickets,
I had just made it on the basketball team
Stroke it round and round
But things get deeper as the story goes on
I wish that I could touch you now
Never meant to make you cry
12 play just a little bit (just a little of my 12 play)
You gave me a reason why, yes, you did
Of an angel lifting me, mmm ?Cause I know where this roads leads to
And I hope you like it girl) This is my song for real no doubt
Give my life for my brother
I was wilding out
I'm about to have me some fun Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce
Real talk, oh
Me with a job opening
Girl let's step the night away
Real talk, hold, hold up
(He's the greatest) at the end of the tunnel
You've got that vibe
We're gonna celebrate, let's go Go Drea, it's your birthday
When a gentleman asks you to dance, you
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
I'll shine a light (shine a light)
Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild All I heard was my baby's voice sayin'
Everybody knows me, knows that basketball is my life
And like the sun oh yeah when it shines real bright,
Then reappear in that Ghost
playing my body like it were a instrument
Somewhere girl to take me back Said I'm sorry for everything (oh yeah) that I ever done to you (said I'm sorry)
Prayer changes (things)
But real talk, I'ma switch it quick
And I'd take up for him
Cutting like some blades on a caddy
Step in the name of love, step from side to side (step in the name of love)
Knowing your body wants something
Is you tweekin'?
She gon' flirt wit her I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt
And I try to keep it real with my homies now

Making plans to be in my life forever

Been watched on these blocks Yeah you know I walk
Girl I promise you this love is forever First you say you love me
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
And I'm gonna be the first to see the sun
'Til they hear it down the hall
And looks behind the door
(when you read)
Well I'm livin the life
While making love to him, girl you're silently calling on me
Yeah your ass was smiling then
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
Out of all the stages I've performed on
Go to work on me
And the party's just beginning
Whatever you take the pain
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah) Man, I tell you it's enough to make you want to give it up
And baby, I wanna make you feel really good while I'm doin' it

'Cause in the midst of this fame my life is like a buffet (yeah)
Well I'm sorry baby, bring your lovin' back to me [Chorus]
Down in the valley, oh

Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me? Mm hmm, similar to what I used to go through Really? Yes, and sometimes I still do Yeah? See it doesn't matter who you are
And the beat goes on and on
Kellz what do you think we should do about it do about it

You're not gonna believe it
Privacy is on the door
And head to the bedroom And I'll be waiting for you right there babey
Sweeter than cotton candy
After all that I've been through
Yeah, yeah, I feel I know you brother very well
Similar to a story, when it's told
And I see ya wife
Are everywhere, nothing else can compare, girl you got the kind of love that
Written on your face
Might just send a Uber, pick a bitch up We been here before
Dedicating this one (I'm dedicating this one) to my favorite girl (To my favorite girl, yeah)
Oh yeah Let's go to the mall, baby
The neighbors keepin' score
