Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And I don't care what the world may say,

The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)
I turned around and before i knew it

Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Whatever it is you want from me, baby

And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I want to get to know you lady
Girl I'm not trying to confuse
In the back of my truck

Oh like lost inside of a mascaraed
Waiting on the phone to ring

She's got that vibe
And Sabrina's got it
She lookin' at you when I walk by

L.A. then Vegas then press our way home
Oh like an expensive suite at the best hotel
Let me show you a better day [Celine Dion]
Set me free (Spirit) Spirit (Spirit), spirit
Sprayed on these blocks
Sex that we're having here, girl, oh Girl, I vow that I would do anything to pleasure you

Said I'm sorry for everything that I ever done to you (said I'm so, so, so sorry)
Cursin' you out, arguein' in public, drinkin', drunk drivin' (mmm)

And man he's got his hands full (hallelujah)
Prayer changes (and all your strength is gone)
Said I'm sorry for all the pain that I ever brung to you (ohh yeah, mmm) I'm sorry baby for stormin' out of the house
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
I cannot ask for more in a woman (oh-oh)

With a gun at my waist

You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna know)
You saved me [3x]
A storm comes out of nowhere
Mmm

And if you got some cash, put yo hands up
More hood on these blocks
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
Let's step out, hit the club
Well it must be a music thing cause she said the same to me
She's a good girl, but tonight she a stripper
And now I finally found
I can hear your body cry
And just like the ocean when the well comes high,
Cause things I want to do to you, nobody has to know (know baby)
(Four) Lie down on the floor
Every hood
Riding that thing just like a seesaw all night
The sign of a victory
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
I'll make you forget about the rest
I just can't help it baby
Honeys on my right
Winkin' her eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
With that bump and grind (oh yeah yeah)

Feel it, can you take all these inches?
Down on my knees
And all of your days will be bright as the sun

This is for the ladies, we got room keys. [Chorus]
Some of my 12 play

Stick it in the ignition So gimme that toot toot
(Snap in the name of love) (In the name of love)
Sex that we're having here, girl, oh
Let me see you and your partner stroll Break it down y'all, break it down
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
And then a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(I gotta have your lovin' baby)
When somebody said God's good
I think about it every night and day (Night and day)
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I hear you callin' me My body's callin' for you
What's up man
New bitch, new brain
Walk hand and hand side by side, I will be the perfect groom you're the perfect
(Girl are you ready)
I can feel it (feel it)
Pull her out the car if she spit up
(He's the greatest) can you feel it?
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
I am a lion
In small towns and big cities
She winked her eyes on the slide
I can fly (I can fly)
Man I thought her body was calling when she said
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you want to see me fail
So let's keep on doin' it, baby
Rise up, rise
With my own pennies and now (Chorus)
Somehow I know it would be okay, yeah 'Cause ever since I met you, girl, I've been positive,
This bitch then lost her motherfucking mind
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Put your bag down and pick your bag up
I want to spend it, baby It's something about your love that's got me going crazy
Be somebody but damn!
Sex that we're having here, girl, oh Hands down you the best, ain't no competition
And you have made my dreams come true, yeah
Spinning you all around
I know she's teaching angels how to love
You won't ever need to patch no more
We'll dance til the morning comes, yeah
It's all your fault that it feels like wood
And right now my body's callin'
Something like my sound, I want to pump it
Hit you with the switch up
And I want to get with you 'cause you's a cutie
Clap in the name of love, clap in the name of love (clap both my hands)
No, cause I want to make it real do you understand, to have and to hold
(Oh, I believe) I wish, I wish, I wish
I shall not fear these blocks
You throwin' ass, I'm catchin' it
Your skies no longer blue
but you about to make me be a bad girl (tonight)
'Cause you're my inspiration, girl
Said the powers that be (Said the powers that be)
Let's make some noise
Not here to preach about the private side, no
I tried to quit
I'll be here (I'll be here)
Tryin' to get on up out the door
The way you're freakin' it is so ya ya
And gave up on all my dreams
Go Vernice, it's your birthday
I used to make love to you daily
Go Teshonda it's your birthday Go Kim, it's your birthday
I left the keys so let your self in baby (sex in the morning, sex all day) Now drop your bags pull yourself a drink
Say yes
Prayer changes (if you can't find a friend)
And you know that I'm flexin' (throwin' my money)
Lead to my regret.
Keep it on the down low
Dedicating this one (Oh, yeah) to my favorite girl
I'm the worlds greatest I am a giant
Walk side by side
And I can feel heaven in it's place And that's the sign of a victory
To stay, on me,
Many lovers have gone
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
(Step in the name of love) (In the name of love)
Media, do your job
Been a real nigga, I don't switch up
I can feel Heaven, yeah
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
'Cause when it comes to parties you know she gets buckwild
Say this pussy is the end all, be all
(Twelve) And that's when I go
Heard a small voice sayin' The storm is over
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
Hey how you like me now?
Break your back, crack it open like a lobster Ay, I kill the pussy, dig a
That's the spirit The winds, the rain
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
What they eat don't make us shit
All the shawties be like (Damn 28's)
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I'm not gonna let you go my baby before I let you know that I [Chorus] I feel so freaky tonight
And she would always be there for you
Mami a rider, I'ma, slide up beside her mama
And saw the mountains (mountains)
And I know the neighbors gotta hate our guts
I had lost all my beliefs
And suddenly the phone rings then I
To what
And what do we do
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine Funny, funny how time goes by
Well, tell me this How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then
