Boom, boom, boom, bass, boom, boom, boom, boom
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack

And you know my style gettin' ripped, bit off!
Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne?
And I needed to know
Even though they know, that I love him
Always get the reaction you wanted
Why they mad? You should see them
I'll leave you drowning in your wet dream
"S" on my chest lemme get my cape on
Would you, would you, give your all for yours [Chorus] [Nicki Minaj:]
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it I was wrong and you were right
Yes I'm rockin Jordans but I ain't a jumpman
Can I get that Coke
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it
Alexander, made me Queen
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
The people are talking
Make me way smarter like you was a magician
Real bosses stand up
But a couple ain't enough
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal?
I'm a brand bitch I'm a brand
Aye whats in ya cup
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
If I was yours and you were mine
I think it's time to put the rice in
In my space shuttle and I'm not coming down
Throw alotta money at her then yell fuck her
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
I'm Texas forever like Bun B, and I'm redboned yo
I'm a bad little bitch and I never indict her
Now bottoms up and double my dosage Bottoms up bottoms up (up)
You should pull up in that Spyder
12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up [Chorus] Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with

Nun-chucker, no time to ducka'

5-year bid up North when they ratted
Woah, Woah, Yea Shout Out to them Bitches trina be me
Get down, get down on the ground. Man, fxck a P0,
Smoking killer, I am with a killer
But I'm alone on my throne, all these riches
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
You Can Eat It Like A Treat, You Can Squirt it, You Can Skeet,
I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
And when these suckas see me, they should bow to my feet
Man I can't even count all of these hundreds
I just sit back and observe, all these niggas that I done curved
Travel, then I bounce, I ball - Sinead, Sir
This box better than the box he was held in
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
On that chardonnay, it's gonna touch down like a runway
Everybody know you jealous, bitch it's so clear
I live with the mother fuckin' pools and the trees is
I hit the liquid and started drippin' into space
I'm pouring out my heart oh boy I-I, I'm not living life
I only argue wit' 'em when the Lakers on
And if ya got money, don't come on my strip
Can't brush shoulders with me
Cash money, getting six albums
Blow the whistle for the hotties
That money talk, I just rephrase it my nigga

Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt (felt felt felt) Its like all the good things
All I want is you so what you tryna do? So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Entrepreneur niggas, and the moguls
I'm pouring out my heart girl I-I, I'm not living life
I let you know how I'm feeling

You mad dusty, you a lil dusty possum
You could eat it wit a pussy reservation
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Bought dope with my album budget
Let him eat the pussy then I dip on him Your bitch call me big daddy

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar

Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding. [Chorus:]
Are we drinking a lil' more I can hardly decide

The sun done

Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet

I'm the only thing hoppin' like a kangaroo
This ain't football why the fuck they tryna tackle me?
He said that, "It's abstract", he said, "Joe, yo ass crack!"
I mean my, my, my, my, you're like pelican fly
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
that I eat it in the morning
Love me, my little waist, my ass colossal
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love I get high off your memory
Competition, why yes I would love some
But I'm not the one you wanna love So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
If you want baby, like
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers
Come and get this va va voom voom I-I-I wanna give you one last option
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes!
Get down, get down, get down down,
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
Look, two pees and a tripod!
Y-y-you fuckin' little whores, fu-fuckin' up my decors
She ain't eatin' but I swear she got some bum ass taste
And I might take your bitch and pay her bills
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
The Boys always spending all their money on love Uh huh, Pretty Gang, Young Money, Cassie I just wanted memories with you Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
Yo nigga call me big mama

Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits
You outta work, I know it's tough
Truth is we mess up
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
But there was something that I should've asked all along
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt (felt felt felt) Take me or leave me
They know better, they know better
My shooters, they shoot at your head, like the rim just to see if the net work
Might pull up in a Porsche, no boxster though
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint All things go, all things go
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Even if that nigga flew me and my bitches all the way out to Dubai
Rich friday It's friday, it's friday
You never switched it up
Uhh You Want A Feaky Girl? Welcome To Nicki World.
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high on my own supply,
Man, this a 65 million single sold
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
And watch the world pass us by Dum-da-de-da
I get head from your lady, have her bill me later
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show
Can't you see the night's still early

If he sexy, he planking on me
No homo', but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
Like your name Hulk Hogan
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I
This club is heating, this party's blazing.
Feelin' myself, back off, cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
The crying game I could've given everything
This nigga keep staring at my phone
I'm out in Haiti with Haitians
Say "I look so good tonight"
Madison Square when the Knicks home
You mad at me go get mad at your nigga 'fore I put my sneakers on
You just gotta see with your eyes I can't believe it, it's so amazing.
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Wonder when they bite me
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
'Cause now it's fuck ya, intercourse ya
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
Yeah, I want you everyday
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
