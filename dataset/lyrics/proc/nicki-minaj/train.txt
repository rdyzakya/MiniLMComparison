They could never reach Young Nick, magnitude
But he really move grams and he split it with his mans All I, all I know is there should be no reason
I can't help but wonder
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
Do if I let you in
Hey, yo Baby Bop, fuck you and your EP

Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

You can't afford a vacation
And I ain't hit that note but fuck a stupid ho, fuck you stupid hoe
Then follow back, that's so me
Big fat pussy with a icy watch I am your leader, yes I am your leader
They thought that you was a shy girl

King pins and them drug lords
Pound the alarm!
And I Ain't Even Sex Him, All I Did Was Let Him Eat My... Coochie [Chorus:]
You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Let me call a few
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
The Boys always spending all their money on love They wanna touch it, taste it, see it, feel it
I'm the terminator, bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her
'Cause I'm a steeler fresh up out the dealer
She's A Very Freaky Girl Don't Bring Her To Mamma
I can't sleep I-I-I-I
"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word Mike Will Made It Nigga
Yes I play it everywhere
And if a motherfucker doubt he can suck my dick
He wanna pound it like a hashtag
Don't want none unless you got buns, hun Oh my gosh, look at her butt
I'm the iPhone, you the Nokia
I went back to the projects, and two mill in Mercedes
You let me hide.
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo I hear they comin' for me
I just reflect on 'em Pills n potions
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
You see right through me
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
Mad cause I'm getting money in abundance
Pumps on and them little mini skirts is out
I ain't coming back this time. I can't believe it, it's so amazing.
Fuck I Look Like Turning Down Some Head?
The good advice
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Pussy still tight, pistol still bang
Come baby go there, stay there
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
I popped a Perc and I said thank you
Tell me what you thank (thank)
I told 'em meet me at the trump, Ivanka
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
Drop a freestyle and get these hoes parched
Buck 50 on yo face with the switch blade
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
Put em on time out and never call these niggaz Pussy like girls damn is my pussy gay?
You could turn a free throw into a goal.
I look down at the beef
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
Kiss my ass and my anus, 'cause it's "Finally Famous"
First I'mma scorch her, then I'mma torch her
Give that bitch a quarter and car tell her park it
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her My chick bad
Yo, give me the muny, the yen and the pesos

Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Running down a court I'm dunkin' on them Lisa Leslie
Pretty ladies, are you here?
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
I say, "'Cause I make two mil' a day"
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Like a grand piano So play on, play on, play on
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
How y'all wifing these thots? You don't get wins for that
Let me hold something
Cuz they be sweatin me like nba player balls
Who the fuck is gon' protect her?
You got spark, you, you got spunk
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap Okay now Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, put it in your kidney
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down
Now that I'm a boss bxtch,
Pills n potions
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive 'em
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'm a don 'em
[Speakin:-]
Gotta let you know, how I'm feeling
Zoomin Like Boosie On Back Of His Suzuki.
I rep Queens where they listen to a bunch of Nas
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties,
If you screenshottin', you the police
Pick a side, pick a side
It go down in the DM (It go down, it go down) I tell her
I'm blowin' money in the wind
Worried bout if my butt's fake
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
Want the cookie so I gotta chips ahoy these niggaz
I'mma run up on you I fly with the stars in the skies,
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
I Mean Come On Now You Know My Fuckin Name, Let's Get It [Chorus:]
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Bom bidi bom bom bom bode bom

I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
I just hope your heart hear me now
'Cause you say Nicki
Tell them bum ass bitches to play their role
Maserati bat black, all I wanna know is where the cash at?
You whip it whip it whip it whip it Na na na na na me go, na na na na na me go

I just know I don't need no, frauds
Let's go I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do
Would you just stop looking through me
He was mixed with a couple things, bald like a couple rings
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
All white like I move things
I feel free, I feel freedom
Yes, I did, yes, I did
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Young Money to the Core
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
This moment will be syndicated, I don't know, this night just remind me of
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
Don't rush, take time, take some
I say I'm in my dream car
Girls is my sons, carried them for 8 months
We shopping for bodies, killing sprees
I was in the chair,
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,
Its in the can.
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
Young Money
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing.
Come and save me now
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him
Anyway I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat-belt him
Now macaroni cheese and grill my sword fish Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch I'm a boss ass
I said, where my fat ass big bitches in the club?
I got old shit, killin' your shit
So get me now, and knock this over
But f-ck who you want, and f-ck who you like
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah
And I will retire with the crown, yes!
Follow shawty then unfollow
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
Baby just say pretty please I'll be back at 11, you just act like a peasant
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
