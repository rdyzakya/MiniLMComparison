They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Cause her babydaddy dont really care
If I lay you down on the mattress
Not a worry in his head
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Im aware Im a king
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
But I know that God put you in front of me
But watch who you bring home
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Off in the mirror like hey me stay me
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes I made it to the Paris news
Whered you come from on this lonely night
In the morning you gon draw a blank

In the bathroom at your mamas

As I turn my Blackberry off
So say goodbye to the NAACP award

Everybody saying please dont let go
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy

Off them tracks yea I bought them cars

Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain
But I had them singles though
Billboard pop star neighborhood block star
But we probably spend it all cause the pain aint cheap
But far as handlin all that ass I think you gon need some help
Such an easy morning we on a ride
Rap floor green
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
Girl its in the morning
Lames try to tell me Cut the wildin out out
But Im in the Matrix and Im feelin Im Neo
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
You should leave your boyfriend now Im gon ask him

Her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin
So Ill tell you what to do
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
On the vocals sings he sings quite beautifully
Last month I helped her with the car payment
One more hit and I can own ya
Im just talking nonsense so nonchalantly
Kanyes just important as Michael Jordan
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
Ay bitch you missed out fomo
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud

Only problem is I see they all want a ring ring
Now everybody is movin they body
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
Blame it on the pigment we living no limits

Until that dayo she take the monorail
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman
All of the time
See I just want him to have an easy life
Why I made that bitch famous God damn
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
She gon think that Im lyin just spit a couple of lines
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Well thats cool I fucked the waitress
So lets get on with it
Yeah she aint got a car she on the bus now
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Snap the Nikons with the icons with Nikes on
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
And at the end of the night bae
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
And Im the best version of Mase next to Fab
Get it
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo
I know I know I look better in real life
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
You realize we at the DoubleTree not the Aria
You almost remember what they name is

YeYeezys please be easy
Cuffed up and hosed down pimped up and hod down
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
Cars money girls and the clothes

Gripping you up fucking and choking you
Oh I remember now its something that I dreamed of
You know just what we want

To my ears at years old

Her allure is more couture tailormade
And Im feelin it right now cause its the time when my heart got shot down
Reluctantly because most of this press dont fuck wit me
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
All that talkin I feed off of keep it up
So say my name like Candyman

That could go from bein stripper to a super CEO

La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
Anything you mightve
And if you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault
Fucking with my clique
Tonight Im finna hop up in that hotel pool
But Ima let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I cant keep my cool so I keep it true
I need to talk to somebody pastor
Put your Blackberry down
And I just want my credit
Thats so novice Im so polished
Now drunk textin
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Cassius in his prime coloring out of the line
It feel like LA it feel like Miami
I can see it through the lens of my Raybe
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
Im just saying how I feel man
Im high up on the line you could get behind me
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
And I dont even wanna hear bout what niggas might do
She find pictures in my email
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
Music and iPhone cameras
But everything that I felt was more bogus
It seems we living the American dream
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
Hopping out the van screams from the fans
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Look back on my life and my life gone
Yo yo yo
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And then my phone started ringing
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
This for the fam do this for the fam
Lookin out my loft windows man my dreams became true
I dont need writers I might bounce ideas
Hard to believe in God your nigga got killed
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
And she grabbin on my dick like
They say people in your life for seasons
Cant wait till they say Ye ran up at the Oscars
They call me Edward Scissorhands cause Im trying to cut
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out
On to the next saga
Shit they say the best things in life are free
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
You say he get on your fucking nerves
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
Its been a while since I watched the tube
So I did what they aint expect from him
Get everything that bein at the top includes
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
Now Im looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
Im not loving you the way I wanted to
And I just always like
Feelin lied to like parents never said you adopted
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
And have my niggas bring all the toast in
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
That lil thing by the hospital bed itll stop beepin
Why is yall
If this is your first time hearin this
Man the drama is so enticing
But when we get together be electric slidin
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
If you aint with us you in our way nigga
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
In the penthouse position
Now he
I see its Dolce Gabbana
Turn this up teacher play this in the third grade
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
To know some if we both honest
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
Man the flow so cold chicken soup wont help
Cause we takin these muhfuckers back to school
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
A lot of people say thats where Ye is
See Ive abducted you
You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
But unless they use a strapon then they not dykes
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
My homie called me like what up man
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
To all my second string bitches try and get a baby
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Only rock things made for a king
About my vision
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
That mean it wasnt even poppin if it not for us
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Good morning on this day we become legendary
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
But I cant take another minute of it at all
I aint gotta say it man dawg trust me
I will destroy
You messin up my mo my whole mood told you oh
And I told you to wait
Dinner with Anna Wintour racing with Anja Rubik
So we can finally fly off into NASA

And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back

The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
Uhm well cutie I like your bougie booty

Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic

And Imma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
But I aint even gonna act holier than thou
Im a legend
I see those flashing lights cause every night every night I put on
I know it was foul baby
And I say brother dont let your guards down
You get to flirtin play her just perfect
You just a commentator if you getting paper
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Long for their shot on the TV screens
Everybody gon say something
I dreamt of Pac he asked me Are you still down
I know that Jesus died for us
When I get back you gon take that
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
Im about to hit the Ye button
But I Dont Say a Word Ill never tell
So I close my eyes
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
But can I please give her these flowers
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
Rock Forever but just turned thirty
Hundred degrees drop the roof so the coupe dont melt
Abbey Lee too Im a freak boo
Heres another fight oh here we go
When we tried our first molly
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
Lets see who really rich
Unbreakable what you thought theyd call me Mr Glass
Who is that in the Phantom please no cameras
I treat the label like money from my shows
When they taste level aint at my waist level
Dumb you fuckin up my mode man
Its am and were just starting again
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Baby you up uestion mark
Im so appalled Spalding ball
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
Imma play this Vandross you gon take your pants off
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
Young Walt Disney Ima tell you truthfully
Really Doe got a different type of plastic on him
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Never been the type to bite my words
Sometimes I still talk to her
Just tryin to take you where the stars gonna surround you
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Was it something I did wrong
Tryin to show yo legs off you aint Amerie
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
I dont give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
Half of thats to Cindys
And the weather wasnt barely hot
But I feel like Michael Jordan Scottie Pippen at my weddin
And Im feeling like Mike at his Baddest
To the victims of welfare for we livin in Hell here hell yeah
These execs
DC PG or ATL
What you rappers could get is a job from me
And then you call upon God
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Was just a secretary worked for the church for years
The head still good though the head still good though
After all of that you received this
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
Primetime basking in the lime
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Its something that a teacher cant teach
Never meet ya mother girl
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
‚àö√Öndale ‚àö√Öndale EI EI uh oh
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
And we made a million a minute we made a million a minute
We aint going nowhere but got suits and cases
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
I mean I promise yall
Every bouncer every club show her extra love
Maybach bumper sticker reads What would Hova do
Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like this
Ask me why I came over
He walked in our lives I was only five
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
Ill move my family out the country
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
He just talkin mines outside
Hold up I aint trying to stunt man
Dashiki kimono or turban
Now its gon be a problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr Christohper Wallace
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali
Like the New World Order
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
Like The Pips at their gladdest
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
She said uh
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
I should hire this bitch she so damn good at Photoshop
And its just so amazing So amazing so amazing
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
You can go head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
Gone for eternity
I want a good girl she want a gentleman
All want the details
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty much
But still supported me when I did the opposite
You shortminded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
Seen or heard
And so instead of sending flowers were the roses
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Like Eli I did it jokes on you motherfucker and I get it
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
For the team
No sports bra lets keep it bouncin
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up
Knowin I cant afford to get mo Get mo
Thats my reality so get off my Scott Disick
And then you look in the sky you got some questions to ask
She claim she got cramps Im gone get you to suck
Stop all your blood clot cryin I was flyin
He
I was too busy flying parasail
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production Yo
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Police escorts everybody passports
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
I got my superman power my superman cape
The ice and me chill
Dressed smart like a London bloke before he speak his suit bespoke
Would you be with JayZ if he wasnt CEO
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Black Timbs all on your couch again
So they could never say we never lived it
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
If you pass on a Kan beat thats your last fault
Cant hide from the truth yeah were bout to go ape
I only like green faces
I feel like its still bitches that owe me sex
I put on everybody that I knew from the Go
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
But if you dont need a fix girl you gotta leave
Wwwhen they violate bbut
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Youre my questions youre my proof
That seem to only date the head of football teams
Now I dont know what the hell this song is talkin bout
Or Jay is
No I seen it in her eyes
But when Ali turn up and be Ali you cant ever change that nigga back to Cassius
Nigga with an attitude I feel like OShea
I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
And Im doing pretty hood in my pink polo
And from that point I never blow her off
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
You know what it is when were outta town
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
Man this is an insult
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
Always rockin that this aint out yet
Up late night like she on patrol
Especially when you got family members on payroll
What if we fucked at this Vogue party
How you feel they say we crazed cause our styles so diff
Since my money get right theses days
Tell em partys in here we dont need to go out
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
And I heard the whole thing
Damn baby pussy cant be your only hustle
Please to meet ya its a pleasure knowing me
They tryna make new slaves
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin
Imma put you on game for the lames that dont know theyre a rookie
And then they make noise
I wish all wack niggasd get out the game
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Baby thats because you the other half of me
But I remember the brain here go a fare for the train and
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
On nights when Ye romance
Had a conference with the DJs Puerto Rico three days
Least he still popping in Japan shopping in Milan
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
It aint happen yet
She stopped drinking Diet Coke
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
I have porno stars and spouses
I asked her you buying
So I can smash their recorders
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And now you wanna get me back
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Every time I breathe on a track I asthma attack it
Before I break now ah ah ah ah
We lost a four leaf clover
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of
Like huh thats us right now
Or or leave the club now
We dont give a fuuuhuhuck
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
You should just go and throw a cape on
I was flying now Im crashing
We dont care what people say
Bow on our arrival the unAmerican idols
Im as Chi as buckfiftys and Pelle Pelle Leathers
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Aint no question who about to kill em
Make me believe in miracles Buddhist monks and Capn Crunch cereal
Late for the class in the hallway nigga
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Brother dont let your guard down
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Tell me how do you respond to students
A monster about to come alive again
You aint built like that
Always said what the fuck I felt
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
Playing some bball outside of the school and
Id be worried if they said nothing
Im tryin to take this money like Rob and G Dep
So glad I aint take the drive to Home Depot
Get back you overclose
You wouldnt wanna lose half your brain
Eh yup thatd be the day you wanna kill a nigga
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
The plan was to drink until the pain over
Id never do that to you at least purposely
No more tripping while you at work
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Cause on judgment day you gon blame me
Most rappers taste level aint at my waist level
The best way that you know
Aww man you sold your soul
Get Olga Kurylenko tell her Im very single
Heard theyd do anything for a Klondike
Man this is classic
But its blurry enough to get the fake out
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us
You know the demo your boy act wild
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Running naked down the lobby
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
Then she came like AAAAAHHH
And Im rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
What you think Way more bitches
See I wanna move but cant escape from you
Ima run the whole election yah
Uh I wish I could give you this feeling I wish I could give you this feeling
You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
Told her she take me back Ill be more supportive
The doors was closed
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore em all up
They say Oh you graduated No I decided I was finished
Im on a world tour with Common my man

We rappers is role models we rap we dont think
How he move in a room full of nos
And be looked at like a fucking hero
But to be number one Imma beat my brother

Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
But Im not loving you the way I wanted to
Bush for sendin our fam to Iran
Told you give the drummer some now the drummer cummin
Well I like the way you think mami
Felt like Im comin to get my all
Sophomore three yurrs aint picked a carurr

Youre good around celebs not too laughy
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
Hit the club with it come on homie they wilding
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
I guess thats a feeling only me and Lebron know
This generations closest thing to Einstein
