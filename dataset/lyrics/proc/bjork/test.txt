Offered me harmony
We'll live in a hidden place
Telur með
Dove tail our generosity
It's all around you
So you left me on my own
It will blossom
Unfold in a generous way
Into a key yahhh
Ya can't tell la leeee
Down my shoulders
Stingrays are floating across the sky
They placed them in their mouths
So special
Yet I'm ? ? ? ? ? ?
It's not up to you
this is the next to last song
Mamma. Allir mndum vid upp til thn
We chisel quartz
The marvellous web
I'll take you
He's got a weird expression on his face!
The tectonic plates in my chest
I feel Emotional landscapes
You sussed it out, didn't you?
Nourish nourish
Love is a two way dream Leave me now, return tonight
All around you All is full of love
And the day feels broken
It will never catch up with me. I'm so broken,
Is being in life threatening circumstances
And she does faults We are the earth intruders
I am inviolable May I, can I or have I too often
Totally still
Slamming against those rocks
I'm a carten
I don't believe this
To almost have allowed
Dabbling outside Kahi
Or will I want more Wanderlust, from island to island
To raise wonderful hell
Just stay strong See selma, you're the one to blame You just did what you had to do
Keep it in a hidden place He's the beautifulest
Trapped in a bay I'm a tree that grows hearts
Palm of hands
With a grin
A snake to shed it's skin
and noone takes a spin
You'll be given love
Come straight from voodoo With our feet thumping
Howweeeeeeeeee
Lull it to sleep I'll keep it in a hidden place
But I just have to
There lies my love
Murmuring drone
Down there I can decide what I give
en mjg trygg, ad g hygg, - But very loyal, I think
You're the intruder hand
Pause on the ball
Fylgir eftir mér
Mudgraves, timber
Luminous
Amweee, eeee, eeee
Well, you can cry me a river
Minun kultani kaunis on
heðan-biður-afte-care
It's in our hands Look no further
Muddy with twigs and branches Forgive this tribe We are the earth intruders
I'm eternally yours
My crystalline charm Like a virus, patient hunter
It burst into flame
By spring that child will die Oh deli owowow
Embrace, you tight, let's unite, tonight One hand
Ad thad sst ekki stari mey. - None shall ever see a sweeter girl
State of, state of
Off me May I, may I or should I too often now crave miracles
Starts in my stomach.
And demand the lights We mimic the openness
En n er nnur ldin, - Everything has since changed
I'm Gibberish
It glided down the sky, she touched it Today is her birthday
If you forget my name
Sonic branches
(although she is slender)
'Cause we're asking for help
May I, can I, should I or have I too often craving miracles I shuffle around
To me?
Fidlurnar mennskir menn
In the shape of a girl
to sabotage our distance Moon will leave me on
Don't you understand?
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
And get to work And if you complain once more
There's more to life than this It's still early morning
You'll be taken care of
Nana na na na, Nana na na na In a tower of steel
(All birthed and happy) Best way to start the new is to fail miserably
By the time I stop waiting I miss you This wasn't supposed to happen,
Eeeeeemmmmm Mmm mmm mmm mmm I am strong in his hands
Some day I'll find you, the urge is here Like a mushroom on a tree trunk
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Out of my head when you never shed a tear Remember, I remember all that you said
Steamroller We are the earth intruders
Break the charm Jump off, your building's on fire
Owwooooeeeeioioeeeee
Weeeeeeeeeeeee
But it seems just destined to crash, I'm so broken,
Owah, owah
So don't you worry I don't know what to do
To show me your palms I'm so bored of cowards
And enjoy every bit of you I see who you are
I have seen the trees
Come on and cry me a river
Always to ourselves
But it hasn't happened yet And if you believe in dreams
No-one cares and no-one loves
And demand the lights Octagon, polygon
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you I cried a river over you
It's not meant to be a strife
Brrbrbrbbbrbrehheee
I am why
svo g kyssti hann og sagdi OK. - So I kissed him and said OK
They focus on her
Sweet like harmony made into flesh You dance by my side
Bravely I, I
I'm sane
You're the one
Nature forges a deal
It feeds you
She renounced the world for you
If I only could
Moon will guide us through, baby
When you're ready An aeroplane
Undo if you're bleeding
As gunpowder needs a war
It's the sparkle you become
Live
But I don't know when I thought I could organize freedom
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go Death is a dream, for in death I'm caressing you
Wooh-ahhh-hmm I'm trying to land,
And I know I'm a bit too intimate
(although she is slender) Hei huulia hillallaa!
And enjoy every bit of you
The kindness kind
In a hidden place
To forgive me
I've seen it all there is no more to see You've seen it all and all you have seen
Although she is slender One breath away from mother Oceanðòa
And I'll catch you, I'll catch you
og thd sst ekki stari mey. - And none had ever seen a sweeter girl
It's become a habit
A distant bell
Spending little time with you
You didn't know I had it in me
Not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
He got a chain of flowers
he said
(vaik' on kaitaluinen)
To come out
Will my eyes
In volume of her glow I miss you
Who knows what's going to happen?
Cobwebs, a bakery sign Ooooh - a sweet clementine
A little bit tired
Who receives her radiance from others She lives in this house over there
But this has
I've always longed for
I've seen the brightness in one little spark
Can you hear the effort
Clinging
That say they want
Build a bridge to her
As soft tissue feeds on blood
Sense of humor
And it will tremble ever so nicely
Only before you I go humble It's not meant to be a strife
Moon will turn me on The moon
Seven phone calls If you leave it alone
Exciting sex! His fingers
Still throwing things off
Dearest of shadows I live with are numberless
Alive with closed eyes To dash
You are gorgeous
(Crystalline) rocks growing slow mo
You're the one who walks me
I'll heal you You think you're denying me of something
Has vanished away
svo hann gat ekki lengur sagt nei. - But he could not deny me
It always was
I know your habits
En-lickel-afte-sjólvar
(in time..)
All that I gave them
To risk all is the end all and the beginning all I've seen it all
Howweeeeeeeee
You are staring at Twist your head around
Is where I want to be State of emergency
In me A secret code carved, a secret code carved He offers
Darling, I hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
This is my home Through the warmest cord of care
Yet i'm, yet I'm the same
And rinsed all of the fear out
Embrace Embrace me
My mother and son pour into us
Underneath
So much on me I'm born, stubborn, me and will always be
Kahiiiiiii
Scrabbles in the earth with her fingers enter mouth
Run for your boy See selma, you're the one to blame You just did what you had to do
And jump between the boats
And multiply
Oooh, I was never alone This isn't the last song
Is where I want to be All that no-one sees
En stll er steig g
Ooooh - to heaven from here
Of smooth mastery With chasteness
It might just happen
See the same girl
Lsi bidilsbuxum var, - Lasi wore his suitor's breeches
So don't make me say it
Although she is slender
Th varst svo strfengleg
And home has been found I'm not stopping
I feast inside you, my host is you The perfect match, you and I
I'm at home with truth alone Moon will leave me on
Moth delivers her message
In a hidden place I am leaving this harbor
life's bothsweet and sour. tak'i takt & trega. ja! I will wade out
I haven't been given
I love him, I love him This time
Just lean into the crack
Lsi vard svo hyr br, - Lasi wore a happy smile
Engin sér við mér So broken,
og th reyndist hann, - And I found out
Liberates me (sets me free) I feel at home Whenever the unknown surrounds me
To form a mutual core As fast as your fingernail grows
On my own I'm human
Will curve gracefully
In a ball of yarn The devil collects it
Ahh-eða-miður-afte-care
You cried the whole night through
I've been hit
Geeeeeeeheeheeeeeeee
Your doors are all shut
All the hurt in the world
Nourished them with their saliva Oh rested, as if the healthiest past time
With many heads
All is full of love, all is full of love If you ever get close to a human and human behavior
There's absolutely no doubt Me and truth
To show me your palms What's so scary
Pagan poetry Morsecoding signals
What's inside of me
Practised for millions of years
All embracing May I, should I, or have I too often craving miracles
We are the canoneers
A tear
Then they can't handle You can't handle love, baby
Scanscanscan
islenskt grey, - Just a poor Icelander
Ya can't tell la le ha
Tell her that you love her Your generosity will show
(Badoop, badoop
But don't ask me what's gonna happen next
Our mother and sons bake for us During the night
I'm gonna keep me all to myself
