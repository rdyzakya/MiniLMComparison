You're going to have to see through my perspective
Oh oh oh crazy but it feels alright,

Don't be a punk punk What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Oh I wish there was something
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh These tears are overflowing

(And I just want to dance with you) Every time they turn the lights down
They want more? Well I'll give them more, ow! Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky

Wipe the floor with all the boys
Got lost in this game, oh baby
I'm falling There's no escape
Feels kinda good
Tell me my true love is here
I'm runnin' away I've made up my mind now
To bring you a special bulletin from the intercontinental radio news.
That soon your face will fade away Every time I try to fly I fall
All the way and I'm able
Wanna see it
So tiny and small
I'm a slave for you, I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me
(Alright) Take your time
I shut myself out from the world so I
We can turn the heat up if you wanna
So I can turn up the bass like Somebody pass my guitar
Take me high and just wipe away my fears,
Triple fun that way
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
I was born to make you happy I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
Watch you take it down People can take everything away from you
Only rocks on what's real
Everybody loves me One, two, three
I try to put it in the past
We'll keep on rockin', rockin' (Oh ah ha)
You might think that I can't take it, but you're wrong
Look hot in a bikini? You better work bitch
Through my heart
Dirty laundry, dirty-dirty laundry (Ah) It's too late for apologies
I'm the only one dancing up in this place
I think I'm ready now Superstar
Cause everywhere we go we bring the action When you hear this in the club
Oh my god here she comes Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
Can't you tell I'm havin' fun
Blood on your face Big disgrace
To the beat of the drum, gotta give it that bass I want to get stupid
Gimme, Gimme, More Give me more, give me more
All the bottom we let it go
You were my first love,
That is just so typically me
I bring the treble, don't mean to trouble ya'
I don't believe in fairy tales
Everything's alright
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Or four
Just to get a better view
'Cause it sounds so good
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees
(I just feel I let myself go) I really wanna dance, tonight with you
Make sure you catch me from my good side (pick one)
Go crazy, oh
Underneath my Christmas tree
But I can't do that with you
Get nasty, oh Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
That you're a liar, a liar I hear you all night talk in your sleep
I wish there was something
You can't handle the truth
My precious love
You looking at me with a sexy attitude
Leaving behind my name, and age
We don't need to touch, just breathe Monogamy is the way to go
I think I caught the flu Look at you
I hide it well, hope you can't tell but I hope she smells my perfume I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
A stranger
The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
Let's take on the zone, lets take on the zone
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain
I kill
Is she in the bathroom, is she smokin' up outside? (Oh!)
Tryna to make you understand
Jump the line, to the front
Not alone not alone not alone But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
I need me (Action!) Say hello to the girl that I am
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy He is a villain by the devil's law
Breathe (breathe) on, (on) me,(me), oh baby
Peepshow, peepshow
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la Baby come with me and be my ooh la la
But I need you and I can take you
Just put your lips together and blow
Leaving behind my name, and age I'm a slave for you (take that) I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
Uh! I said: All:
(So dance with me)
Yeah... Buddy, you're a boy
C'mon get me, get me on the floor
But, I ain't sweatin' you
This feelings so strong
You gotta take that leap
I was born to make you happy I'd do anything
Right now
If you don't like the company
Na na na na na na na na na I see you lookin' over here
Pushin' hot Bugatti whips
(As long as you want it come with me we can do it baby, baby, baby) I am here to testify
Do about my destiny
I could do It's been a while
Hurts my eyes
Oh baby, oh Oops, I did it again
Then why do these tears come at night? She's so lucky
I'm a slave (it just feels right) for you (it just feels good)
I'm a have to floss on you
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
Spread the word
One, two, three
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh See that sunlight, we ain't stopping
(I got you)
And let go
In one ear and
Womanizer Boy don't try to front, uh, I
Even though we couldn't last forever
Somebody's caught up in the endless pollution
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh No rules
Get it get it, get it get it (oh) I really wanna dance, tonight with you
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
The air
But every time you come too close I move away I wanna believe in everything that you say
But I don't even hear
To let go You gotta let go
Red carpet and cameras Take trips around the globe
Feels like no one else in the room (but you) We can get down like there's no one around
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Here we go (You're a liar, liar) You can call, call, call
Like a dream
I feel so small
Whoa, oh Beyonce:
Hit me baby one more time Ten p.m. ten to four
I won't return to thee I'm sorry to say I'm running away now
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm a slave for you,
I don't need nobody, not anybody
(You want a piece of me) I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Turn up the fader
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
When we cross the line
I guess I need you baby I make-believe
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! This just in
We got one night only
Ive even read it in my script
Is crying 'cause of you
So are you game? Lets' make a team

No wonder there's panic in the industry
Till he was with me, yeah, with me Singing I love rock and roll
My baby it's you
Weezy F baby, baby I keep my shoes clean
All eyes on us
All decked in lace and leather Heels 6 inch
Yeah, yes it is
Freakshow, a freakshow, a freakshow Make 'em they clap when we perform
We will rock you! I need time (time)
(La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la) So tell me if you see her
Don't need a reason why
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Work it hard, like it's your profession
'Cause we don't Womanizer, woman-womanizer
By the record machine
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize
The girl in the mirror
But to somebody else
Pick up what I'm putting down
To need release
Womanizer Daddy-O
Must mistake me, you're the sucker
And everytime I see you in my dreams,
Treat you right, be with you day and night Baby all I need is time I don't wanna be so shy
I, I'm stronger Lately I've been stuck imagining
Okay, you think you got me where you want me
(They say I'm nasty)
Hold your hands high
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love that guy And he's got my name,
Oh, pretty baby, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I'm not your property as from today, baby
Be my honey tonight 'Cause you're beautiful
Pleadin with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Things that I've been told
Because he's looking over here
If I said my heart was beating loud
You're a womanizer
Are begging to if you seek Amy (Love me, hate me) La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
Sicker than the remix
Oh baby, baby
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance

Won't you give me something to remember?
I'm not trying to hide. Yeah! Baby baby baby baby baby baby Oops oops oops oops oops oops oops oops yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hate to stare
Cause it's getting late
Of all youve known
Gimme

Crazy
Yeah, you make me ooh Confidence is a must
The more I come to understand
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la Take my hand, we can go all night

There's nothing you can do or say, baby

Fire come down, fire-fire come down (Ah) It's too late for apologies
That means the trouble's on
I can roll if you can
I'm really not souped
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time) Fell in love with you and everything that you are
It's my prerogative It's the way that I wanna live
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
From the bottom of my broken heart Never look back, we said
I want to get in the zone
Never met anyone like you Baby you're so unusual
Hope that you will wait for me
I don't even know you But here, I got a snicker for you, here! [Chorus:]
You're gonna be a big man someday
The taste of your lips
I'm not that innocent. But now I'm stronger,
Come get some Britney:

Don't you know that you're toxic? It's getting late
We can give 'em a encore Make it a

'Til there was you
Brit, I heard, I heard, what you gonna do now? This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
Fire come down, fire-fire come down
You know that I can take it,
Oh Get it Get it, Get it Get it I'm a slave for you,
(mama told me don't) Take candy from strangers
Baby I would go with you anywhere
We don't need to touch, just
Bring it on
When we fall in love for the first time Okay, the shoe is going on the other foot tonight,
(All I need is time) all I need is time
Just grab somebody
Like a what? (like, like, like, like a circus) All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Oh baby, so I can let you go I can hear your voice
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
When I put on a show I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Playing my favorite song
Oh baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
Igniting the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
(That's my prerogative) It's the way that I wanna live
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes)
But now I shall, break free from all your lies
Brit, I heard he said he could stay if he wanted to, and
Whoever said that beauty on the inside is a liar
Oh no
Like them city boys from New York This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
Ow
Oh crazy
Make 'em say my name
(I like a bad girl, I like a bad girl) Bring ya to ya knees
Another day another drama
of us in here baby CHORUS So I, wait for you to call
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Do you like it
yeah, yeah I got a plan we can do it
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I don't see the harm
Eh Yeah Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
See the girls in the club
Taking time is what love's all about But you put a dart through my dreams
Baby just, breathe on me (on me)
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Even when theyre up against the wall
When we fall in love for the first time
It's gonna be fantastic love
We got them candles hanging
Oh, toy soldier
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah You say I'm crazy
Keeping secrets under your sheets
Strip down and give me my own private show
I'll get it all figured out
Countin'
That life doesn't always
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
So don't tell me to shut my eyes I'm not a girl
Got you on my radar
At the same time, it's over now
If they wanna know
(Now watch me) Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Hit me baby one more time I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
All of the pieces with it
It's time that I
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
I wonder who she is
Breathe, breathe, oh Breathe on me (oh, oh) oh
Maybe, Maybe
But every time I do I stand corrected
Can't wait for my sugar rush Can't take it no more
Where are you now (where are you now), you gotta let me know (you gotta let me know)
Cause I was feeling down,now I`m feeling better
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
So forgive me If I do
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer) It would be all good
Oh yeah..
Snatch that boy so fast
Sometimes I run, (sometimes) sometimes I hide
(As long as you want it come with me we can do it baby, baby, baby)
Steamin' like like a pot full of vegetables Boy, boy
Tonight I'm feeling sexual
'Cause you know me inside out Outrageous, when I move my body
Gonna take on the world someday
I got running through my mind, whoa Shame on me
I, I'm stronger Then I ever thought that I could be, baby
I think you already know, oh The feeling of going down way too deep
I don't care 'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal
You got the swagger of a champion
Oh, oh
Been about seventeen
Up til now, I thought I knew love
That's my prerogative
You got my display of affection
(When you walk)
It's like a competition
You're always where you said you will be
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
Until I'm about to keep it forever Outrageous, when I move my body
Oh, you're tempting me
Like Penelope in Blow
Here comes the beat, beat
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
Stronger than yesterday
I'm so excited I'm in too deep,
Escape, exit door
Why don't you do somethin'? Fuck
The fire comes in the sapphire sun
(Ah) And I'm all listened out Call, call, call
I run a tight ship so, beware
But Cinderella's got to go My heart won't skip a beat
Treat you right, be with you day and night All I really want is to hold you tight
Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)
See everything true
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
It will open up for everyone but you
(That you will be here)
And tonight you gon' be my be my man Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

If I got on top, your gonna lose your mind

But my life has been so overprotected I'll tell them what I like, what I want, what I don't
All you do is look at me, it's a disgrace
'Cause without you
(Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)
No, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
Cause I aint goin nowhere I think I see confetti from this potion
You will see it in my eyes
I gotta mark my territory I'll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
Oh yeah.. It goes on and on and on and on
All my girls still feelin' me B-girl ain't lost the beat
Think I can handle that
Say what you want about me

When I'm out from under
See me coming
Pick up what I'm letting down
Yeah, this sounds nice
Oh baby
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'

We keep on rockin, we keep on rockin', rockin'
And do somethin' I see you lookin' at me
Party all night long
Yeah, with me Singing I love rock and roll
They buzzing around me like flies
Call me the governor
(If you really want to battle)
Tell me, where are you now, you gotta let me know
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone Not alone not alone not alone
I start purring like a machine
Can you feel me now? Oh,
You know that I can take it
And I just wanna dance with you Every time they turn the lights down
And I came to hit the floor
Keep on dancin' till the world ends Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare

It's just me against the music, its just me and me, yeah come on Hey Britney, are you ready, uh-huh, are you? When no one cares
See the boys in the club
But I'm here now I know it's been a while
Patterns will fall as quick as I do, but now Bridges are burning
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now what we've got My loneliness is killin' me
Sitting in the mirror, getting pretty
I made you believe we're more than just friends
So let me go, and just listen All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
I'd rather give it up than carry on (oh my love)
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
You womanizer
Gotta thank you, gotta thank you [Chorus: x2] Hey! Is this thing on? I saw him dancing there
Just want you to raise my roof
Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me
Turn the lights down low if you wanna
I know you heard it before
Makes it hard, it could be easy
So overprotected I wanna see you move! With a taste of your lips
So outside the norm
The world is yours and mine
I'm about to give it to ya Media over here
Oh boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
To love, you gotta let go
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Feels like the crowd is sayin Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
I've lived my life [Chorus]
Unusual You Said you're gonna be here in a minute
baby (baby), baby (baby), baby Ooh, ooh baby
You're some kind of fine Oh

Come and get it
Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly I love myself
I'm so damn glad that's over
And they say She's so lucky, she's a star
Doin' how we do
I cannot controll it,
Without my wings
I bring the trouble
So dry your tears and rest assured
I want someone to love me someone to hold
Lovin' the extreme
And singing that same old song
But you're frozen
Make it clear

'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there I'm a slave for you, I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I can't control what's happenin' 'Cause I just discovered
Those lips and your brown eyes
Yeah Let me break the ice
Hold on to myself and don't look back I don't wanna dream about
And you made it so perfectly clear
They got one thing on their minds
(Oh)
Baby bump bump
Current girl friend, ex girlfriend, I'm trying to be cool
Red lips

Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you

My heart's on fire when you're around

Hopin' I'll resort to startin' havoc
Sometimes I think I know her
I'm like the ringleader
More than anything I ever felt before You drive me crazy
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Live in a big mansion
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning

Cause thats what bad girls do Imma bad girl, Imma, Imma bad girl
I'm so glad we're at the same place

Sometimes I hide
All decked in lace and leather Baby take a seat
Someone else but me (Action!) What am I to do with my life?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Spark and it's like gasoline
You burn up
It's a crazy night
Trying to make remarks keep us apart
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
I love rock and roll (rock and roll)
All you had to do was yell and I'd be there for you Here I am, so try to forgive me
Something sensational seansational, oh yeah)
I need space
They don't see me rolling my eyes
Here we are with nothin' but honesty
It might seem like a crush
That you're the only one I belong to
But when I thought it wasnt fair
My mama told me got love yourself first
But who am I to say
Know just, just, what you are, ah, ah Womanizer, woman-womanizer
And this song's my sorry At night I pray
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Why don't you do somethin'? Now you're all in my grill
How am I supposed to know what's right?
Please forgive me
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)
You're a womanizer, baby You, you, you are
Let's just do it you and me
I just wanna take it off, I just wanna take it off
Get up out of your seat
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy You
Hit me baby one more time I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too
You, you, you are
It's in the air and it's all around
Oh baby, baby, baby
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now what we've got My loneliness is killing' me
They watching us
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep (The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
On the floor
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I did it again
Like a slumber party 'Cause we got them candles hanging
Had to get used to the world I was on
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Boys, and when a girl is with one (I get nasty)
Go call the police, go call the governor
(Let's go) (Like that)
(The girl in my mirror)
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
Inside out I know that we probably shouldn't do this
And me down, and me down, and me down
That I'm not wastin'
They need to wake up, stop living illusions I know you need to hear this
(That's long gone)
Gimme,
This is my wish that we all feel connected
Get naked I'm not ashamed of my beauty you can see what I got
How did I get through
Oh pretty baby

(That's my prerogative) Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because My loneliness is killing me (and I)
Why carry on without me Every time I try to fly I fall
What a girl is to do?
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
Choose it, you don't wanna lose it
I realized that they ain't listening
I see that spark flashing in your eye
It puts me in the mood What would it take for you to just leave with me?
If you care like I know
When you call my name
There's things about me you just have to know Sometimes I run (sometimes)
A little question
Baby cry, cry, cry
To see the state I'm in
Livin' in sin is the new thing
(Dance with me) Dance with me
But now I know
Come with me we can do it
Are you kidding me?
You might think that I won't make it on my own
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers
I wanna show all the dirt
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
Give me a sign,
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go I must confess that my loneliness
But girl, you look so sweet

'Cause, you feel like paradise
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la Its written everywhere

Boys, then she's in control (You like that? Here we go) Tonight, let's fly, boy have no fear (have no fear)

The reason I breathe is you

Watch out now, cause here it comes

You were my first love

Watch me take it down Get on the floor
Cause that I heard that you're coming to town.
You made me realize not to compromise
Show me how want it to be
'Cause, what I'm looking at right now
Love I can see, nothing will be, just like it was
Hot (more) Let me break the ice

Boys, and when a girl is with one (Get nasty)
I feel so small,
Can't let go when I keep wondering Where are you now, what have you found
Can't come down
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
We could have worked things out
Light it up and let`s let it blow,blow,blow
So I can look like a star
And spin me round just the way I like
I'm on a ride
You want a piece of me (It's Britney bitch)
Come over here I got something to show you
(I just can't help myself)
So tired of you being up in my space
Like a slumber party Let's fill up this clawfoot bath with bubbles
Go call the governor
But my life has been so overprotected I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
Grab us a couple boys to go
Your lips, you're fine, you're heaven on earth I've waited all my life for you
(I like a bad girl, I like a bad girl) It's so hot in here Oh, it's so hot and I need some air
You can watch as I shake If you want it, come and get it
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
If you want this good, bitch
Then why do these tears come at night? Lost in an image, in a dream
(Don't you know I still believe) When I'm not with you I lose my mind
I get the feeling that I just want to be with ya
But if you really want me, move slow
Can you turn me up a little bit more
It's 'bout time I hit the streets
Don't you know that you're toxic? With the taste of your lips
Just want to go that extra mile for you
Little hazy
It's haunting me
Everything
Won't be just coming over (I need, I'm so sick of toy soldiers)
Baby, give me it

By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe

Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more The center of attention
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
Sent from above
Would you hold it against me? I used to think
And all the love
Boys, to love her and to hold (the way you move)
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
To think that I
And I don't want to be so damn protected There must be another way
You so fine
I guess I need you baby I may have made it rain
And my body is mine
Oops, you think I'm in love
So come and take the time
But I don't give a damn
Are begging to if you seek Amy Love me, hate me
Got lost in the game,
Am I just insecure? I want to believe
(Watch them go)
I'm in love with you I'm so in love
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')
I'm in control tonight
We be keeping them up on their toes
You better work bitch "Ladies and Gentlemen, we interrupt our program of Dance Music,
Party in France You better work bitch
Is too much, gasoline When the music goes up
Out in Vegas or little bars
The touch of my hand There's a world undefined
I've seen her once or twice before she knows my face
The touch of my hand 'Cause I just discovered
Think it and you can achieve
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
Baby, take your time
The lights lights
Let your inhibitions go
It's right at home, between my hands
Show me how you want it to be
I cry, watching the days
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Cause I ain't goin nowhere There's only two types of people in the world
(Still believe)
(This is it, this is it) I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
You can hear my sound
Would make a big girl cry
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
And it feels like
Imagination's taking over
I need a hit
Keep on dancin' till the world ends Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(They said I'm crazy) Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
I'd give you my world
Beautiful
Freakshow freakshow
Not yet a woman
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
By your look youre through
Too bad for you
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
And every time I see
(I need, I'm so sick of toy soldiers)
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
(Wanna see you move)
Answer my call, here after all
I've seen so much more than you know now
Working hard like it's your profession
But if you don't then now u know
Cause I believe in taking chances
There's more to me than what you see (oh)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
I can feel you deep inside
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So follow me and I can make you
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
You were my real love, I never knew love
Another day without a lover
Haha, hehe, haha, ho Love me, hate me
Every time you look at me
I have been so good this year
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la (Be my ooh la la) Ooh my my baby don't be shy
Such a classic tale
Bombastic Love
Stop you're making me blush
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Fall off the edge of my mind
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Oh, oh) Taste of your lips
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Hey yo,turn it up and turn it down
Just, breathe (breathe) on, (on) me, (me)
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
Wrap me up in all your love
Uh
Not trying to sound conceited
Don't you know that you're toxic? Intoxicate me now
And they're playin' my favorite song
This is my body
I don't need your money
I said, "Can I take you home
Loving you means so much more
All I know, should've let go, but no
There's things about me you just have to know Sometimes I run
But, you're winnin'
Our imagination, taking us to places
The pain that she's feeling The sense of loneliness will fade
I spotted you dancing
You got blood on your face
Really to hit, you could die
I'm not trying to hide it (Like that) There was a time I was one of a kind
I said: All:
Baby, let me blow your mind
We will rock you! Yeah...oh! All:
We're just so pretty! Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Just time to get it now
I've always wondered what was off limits
Why won't somebody feel this
Don't worry you will be alright
Next one on my hit list
Hanging from the ceiling low
When you're next to me, it's just like heaven on earth
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
I'mma be a little selfish..
Now I'm stronger than yesterday
They keep watching (They keep watching)
Hotter than the A-list,
With the love that felt so strong
Peek-a-boo, he good, doing things you wish you could
Screaming in his ear
Would you hold it against me? If I said I want your body
Cotton candy kiss
Are, you in
But my life has been
Be my prisoner of love tonight
Now are you game? Are, you in
I got you crazy
Intoxicate me
Watch out now
(You like it)
Your one and only pleasure
Everything will be shown
All my people, 'round and 'round let me see you dance
Be a little selfish
And scream and shout and let it out
Kamikaze fire come down
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
I get the tingle
The legendary Ms. Britney Spears
Can't be alone under the mistle toe
But you warm up to me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Then why do these tears come at night? I'm Miss American Dream since I was seventeen
Can't somebody take me home?
I know you wanna touch
You and me
Anywhere you wanna
I want it now
The sweat is dripping all over my face
That you're a liar, a liar So here we go
(You just got to do it your way)
But Cinderella's got to go To say I want you, You cast me under your spell
I make the world want you
Ohhhh, but can't you see what I see?
In working and being a mama
But my life has been so overprotected There's a girl in the mirror
Saying all kinda names but none of them me
And all I want is one thing
Are begging to if you seek Amy Oh baby, baby
We're just so pretty! Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
All these years weve been
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spreadin' myself around Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Sip martinis
I guess I need you baby
You know I know that you know I know
But, I'll change your life after tonight
I just wanna take it off, I just wanna take it off What ya tryin' to do, do, do
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
I got it, and you know it
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
You just can't find the right companion I guess when you have one too many
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor
You ain't gotta be scared
And you will see the rainbows
Oh boy, tonight is ours (It's just you and me, baby)
I gotta make sure that blindness won't stop me again
Don't stop it let it flow
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Starrin' at us
Pop it like a hood
I wonder how
Be a little selfish Tonight I'm feeling sexual
To another time and place
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy What's practical is logical, what the hell, who cares?
And part of me still believes
And get your own space
To find your space Take off [?] see everything
All the other chicks out here
