Trench coat and my underwear
Break it down
So hot that you're coming out your clothes
How was I to know I'd miss you so? For whatever reason
Here I am, so try to forgive me
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
All I need is time (is all I need)
I won't be blind you see, my love it can't be sacrificed I won't return to thee (I'm so sorry, I've already made up my mind)
I'm 'bout to turn you into my very own flight tonight
Lightning strikes
They go
Whisper softly and the world just dissapears
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Pick up what I'm putting down You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
That man's a snitch and unpredictable
Unusual You Can't believe that I almost didn't try
You're sweet, your love, your tongue I'd move across the world for you
I see nothing wrong
And spend this cash like What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Oh, and when you mention my name
And your curiosity
'Cause now I'm Stronger than yesterday
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)
Like a slumber party (I go crazy for you)
All the things that never were
Be like a rocket All the people in the crowd
What youre revealing
Now get to work bitch!
I send it off and just said this
Go my way, yeah
candy from a stranger, candy from a stange, a stranger [Chorus x2] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
The joy of Pepsi And you will find
They looking at us
Sometimes I really wish I did There's a story in her eyes
(When you talk)
Keep on dancin' 'till the world ends
We might make a scene
Breathe, oh, yeah Oh, this is way beyond the physical
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
You can cry wolf
Windows roll down
baby (baby), baby (baby), baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You're beautiful
Tell 'em to make room
(From under, from under, from under, from under) I don't wanna dream about
When we're dancin' on the floor
The way that I trust in you Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Locking down the industry
You're some kind of fine Oh, I think I like you
That you are here
(Drop dead)
You're some kind of fine You must be B-I-G
I could do I can't believe it's what I see
I got to have more tonight
I want to get in the zone If you really want to party
I don't want no more
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
These other (ha) just wanna be me
(You just gotta do it your way)
sweeter than a Hershey Kiss
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
The legendary Miss Britney Spears
Just cut the shit, be honest
Do you feel me now? Oh,
(ahhhh) [Verse 2]
It ain't gonna stop
When getting the groceries, no, for real
You keep coming back to tell me
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night Get it Get it, Get it Get it,
I'm loving it Too high
Like a slumber party The way you smile, the way you taste
Getting boys is how I live
It's simply true
And with a kid on my arm
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
All night long (We're almost there)
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Even though time may find me somebody new
No shame in the game
Forever I don't wanna dream about
Jaws on the ground
It seems so close to me
That's why I'm dusting off my fitted
That's the oxygen I need Ooh, ooh baby
Unusual You Been so many things when I was someone else
(Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja)
I, I stronger! Stop! Everytime I try to fly I fall,
And when you talk
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That something wasn't right here
We can read each others minds
Ooh please make my wish come true
So here we go
(Let me know what she was wearing and what she was like)
I ain't even losin' sleep (oh)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I get nasty)
My heart only runs on supreme
Something I could do If I could
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Edges I like 'em rough
(Do you want more?)
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Not long ago
Slowly, it's taking over me Too high
And It's gonna be exactly like in a movie
So let go
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in
Lay back, and let me tell you what I'm thinking
And I'm caught in between
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
You better work bitch Now get to work bitch
Tryin' and pissin' me off
Cause thats what bad girls do Im a bad girl Ima do what I do
I'm in love with you Your breath, your face, your hands, your head
Bring ya, bring ya, bring ya to ya knees Im a bad girl Ima do what I do
Well baby, I went down and got it for you
ooh santa
You're gonna have to remove me
Cause new Britney's on a mission When I shut the door, leaving with my bag
When the light's out Shame on me
You broke the mold
Like a princess supposed to get it
I might be
I know what you are
Some ask me questions
It's not a sin
Or you happy to see me? [Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby I got a plan we can do it
Guess I can't see no harm
I am the bad bitch, the bitch that you'll never know Hold your head high, fingers to the sky
When I crack that whip, everybody goin' trip
Let go The touch of grass
Got one eighty degrees
Taking out my freak tonight
And give me a sign
That you will be here
Nothing to loose and its damaged cause
Keep on lying through your teeth
Lost in the world out of me myself and I
And let it go
Cause I like you, Cause I like you baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah You don't like me
It's nothing but my way
Your teeth, your tongue, your eye, you're mine
Cause I got you on my radar
What happened to you?
But you know I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, oh no
How much more could I take?
I'm Mrs. 'Most likely to get on TV for strippin' on the streets'
You in my dreams
But to lose all my senses
Be all my own in a big red bow
I guess I need you baby. What am I to do with my life
Keep it building higher and higher So hold your head high
And try
A girl like me will bring you to your knees
That I've seen in my life
Diamond, diamond
Just call out my name (just call out my name) I will be there (and I will be there)
Not alone not alone not alone Crossed through the universe to get where you are
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
I just want more! Gimme, Gimme
But I know that we tried everything we could try
Boy, boy
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And I won't be denied
Livin' in sin is the new thing (yeah)
You gotta turn turn it up
I'm gonna be a little selfish Boom, boom, baby
Touch me and i come alive
Cant nobody touch me
Not to show the world that it was you
Everything is gonna be alright
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
What you're made of, what you're gonna do
Well did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world Always saying little girl don't step into the club
Drink it up and drink some more
Won't be just coming over
Oh baby, baby Oops, I did it again
I smell your breath
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
He's all I want, just for me
Left, right, nowhere to turn
It's been too long
That I'm the only one you will see
Just work your body
In love I fall so deep, so deep
My weakness caused you pain
You got me reaching with my fingers
You wanna [Chorus]
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight
(I see you)
Look hot in a bikini
To the next level, baby
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me, (me) oh
When you're with me
They still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazine
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more I just can't control myself, oh!
I've got you
You better work bitch
Ooh That was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
Cameras are flashin while we're dirty dancin
Dancing table top freaky freaky
Make the music dance
Tear the floor up up
I dont wanna be the one
But I'm glad you came
But all of the boys and all of the girls
And baby we can dance all night Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Oh Three is a charm
I took a sip
underneath my Christmas tree
We saying oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
Oh baby, baby, baby... La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
Ignite gasoline When the music goes up
I can't help the way I feel
And the unstoppable Danja
(Hey hey hey) All my people on the floor let me see you dance
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
You public display of affection
Ten million dollar smile
Bring ya, bring ya, bring ya to ya knees
All my joy through my tears
Like I'm some kind of freak
Don't you know I still believe
Strangers when
I'm in a trance
I could tell it wouldn't be long
Tell me have you seen her, cause I'm so (Oh)
Look but don't touch
With a taste of poison paradise,
Like I got what you need
Got these fellas chasing me
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
But the way your boys moving it
You can tie me up boy
Is there still longing there?
Don't worry your gonna be alright
Animal in the sack
What have I done
I wanna see what you can do What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Let your mine roam free
I'm not a girl There is no need to protect me
In your arms I finally breathe
Hear this and you'll want to sing
Shut up, sit down
Keep it building higher and higher
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop
Oh baby, baby, we'll do whatever you'll like
More than anything I ever felt before [Chorus]
But me and you we're meant to be
I wanna see you Get on the floor
If there's seven minutes in heaven make it double, triple
I got running through my mind, whoa Baby, I'm so into you
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
If you think you're so hot
But I'm never gonna come
(It's a way beyond the physical)
That's when I realize I'm not a girl
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments
And maybe I could be your girl
But it's hard to see with all the people standin' in the way (Oh!) Oh (Oh)
I'll be waiting here
Your touch, burning me
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
So let's just say goodbye
Shocking cause I never knew love like this could exist Tables are turning
Back and forth like this was all tennis
I'm not that innocent Baby, I'm so into you
Without you
I just want more Gimme gimme, gimme, gimme gimme
We saying oh wee oh wee oh wee oh You are now now rocking with Will I Am and Britney bitch Oh yeah..
And my eyes see it all so clear
Hit me, baby, one more time My loneliness is killin' me
What you are, baby Womanizer, woman-womanizer
To find your space Take off, take off
Give me more, give me more babe (Danja Danja, Danj)
Ego trips is not my thing
Here we go,we gonna shake the ground
Rockin' new designer fits
Spread the word, spread the word

Keep it building higher and higher Work work work.... Work it out work it out... You better work bitch
Make me like Im your toy
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
But I know what you are
And you want a piece of me I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
My loneliness is killin' me
We'll keep on rockin' (We'll keep on rockin')
You're heaven, you're heaven on earth
Just like a circus
But it feels alright
When me and you party together
'Cause your the only one within my heart
Here comes the smasher, here comes the master
Never thought it would end From the bottom of my broken heart
(Tell me why)
I wont deny it,
If it's alright
Or three
