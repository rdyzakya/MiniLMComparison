Why deny the obvious child? Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself
I slammed into a brick wall I said hey, is this my problem?
He said Dolores
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder
This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
And he used to lean upon me as I pledged allegiance to the wall.
But I would not be convicted
To the fate of mankind
Longing my life away
From the cinematographer's party
Love like lightning shaking till it moans
Some have fled from themselves
Heaven's only daughter
It's sleeping in my memory.
The air is thin
A trailways bus is heading south into
I'd say God bless the absentee I miss my woman so
Spanish children are taught on their knees to believe
Fifty ways to leave your lover You just slip out the back, Jack
Shake a rattle at the skies
Que amanha -- That tomorrow
Lights a candle in the middle of the night
But if your hopes should pass away
I live in fear
Down by the school yard
Won't you stop and remember me
When in fact we're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away
You're shaking my confidence daily
I won't be wanting anymore Take your burdens to the Mardi Gras
And his wisdom like a river flowed
Singer in a Sunday choir
Trying to drive me underground
When all these numbers tumble into your imagination
Hernandez, the "Umbrella Man" chained beside me
Wash your tangled curls with gambler's soap Proof
And possibly unscramble us
It's a glorious day,
Collect our pay
It's a fine day
All the children on the street
She said why?
He said I hate to break it to his fans
Any aliens here you better check with us
He was doggedly determined that he would get her
A Spanish boy could be killed every night of the week
Down the highway
All of these spirit voices rule the night My hands are numb
We signed the papers
Well you know you'll find me crying. Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe I'm blind
Yes, and often felt forsaken
No easy trick
Drift in the breeze Oh and it's the same old story
Twenty-three Years old the day he died Freedom writer
Well they'd kill us if they could Aurea & Women
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
Laugh about it, shout about it
Will shine on you forever
When I thought I heard somebody
The father motionless as stone
It's just like goin fishin'
A year after J.F.K.
The blues have run the game. Living is a gamble, baby,
Some people say a lie is just a lie
Do-n-do-d-do-n-do
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Flying on their feet
Everybody sees the wind blow I'm going to Graceland
And everything else becomes nothing at all It was the morning of October 6th, 1960
Examined every one
In his anger and his shame,
I'm going to call the whole thing to a halt You don't feel you could love me
And I heard the sound
A shattering of shop windows
The desert moon is my witness
Headed down the turnpike for New England, sweet New England Holes in my confidence
She said who am I
Hear my words that I might teach you
It wasn't hard to do
I'll wake up older,
People hearing without listening
For the greasy pair?"
Maybe I've a reason to believe
I'm gonna stand guard like a postcard
He said there's no doubt about it
He says why am I short of attention
I can snatch a little purity
But I say why
And wo my nights are so long
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Stand guard
Run that body down
In the back of my building
Well, we're living a life of sin When I ain't drinking, baby,
He flies a silver airplane
His daughter more than I love you Trust your intuition
Why won't you love me
And no one dare
Faith
Still, when I think of the road
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
Graceland
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
At the Golden Retriever
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
I can read the writing on the wall Kodachrome
Take my arms that I might reach you"
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
They never seem to hear even your cry So as sure as the sun will shine
Hey let your honesty shine, shine, shine now
Soft and warm continuing
Trying to steer you away from me
These prayers are the memory of God
Proof is the bottom line for everyone Half moon hiding in the clouds, my darling
You're the girl of my dreams
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
You have underestimated my power
In the New Orleans And I will lay my burden down
And look around
On the soldiers by the side of the road
Come on home Jubilation,
I fear I'll do some damage
The pale yellow moon shone in his eyes
He sees angels in the architecture
Sight of the grassy knoll
No moon that night
This country's changed so fast
And the Congress call my name
And the right side has to labor
Let the Capeman burn for the murders Salvador
Was ringing 'round my nursery door
The cross is in the ballpark We had a lot of fun
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
And follow your memory upstream
And I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
I was resting my head
The fields are ripe
Now that my role-model is
But I say
And then you wait in the line
I've been following the light across my room
When I ain't sleeping
Well the hour of your bedtime's
Anger and no one can heal it
And purifies my life
Somebody says what's a better thing to do
Looking for the places
When you're down and out,
About some words that were said
Downhill town
But who are they
And leave a spray of diamonds
A fortress deep and mighty,
Where the ragged people go
Slipping into stone
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
It's a street in a strange world
I'm begging you please to come home Celia, you're breaking my heart
That's what that old army post was for Well, the sun gets bloody
I've been licked, washed up for years
Angel of Mercy, well people are suffering
An ocean of debris
That tells me what my dreams are made of
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Sonny's yearbook from high school
His eyes as clear as centuries
Say, ain't we walking down the same street together
He wears a golden cross God bless the absentee Lord
Stranded in a limousine Hey hey hey hey
Whenever you believe that
The boy in the bubble
I got to go, I got to go"
Mountain passes
So you always know
On Seventh Avenue
All come to look for America
She said a good day
And never leave
Well I guess I'd been in love before
I'm gonna
What the mama saw
This is how I love you baby
She cannot stop
I am an island. Don't talk of love,
The Bible's old
Sing rainwater, sea water
And she told all about the Pentecost
His hands rolling down her hair
I grow weak, I go slack
That whisper in my ears
A teaspoon of desire for my meal I trade my tears
She is like a top
Gonna watch you grow
And held me to his chest
These are the days of miracle and wonder
Than one or two
Now, who you foolin? Kid you better look around
You can beat us with chains
Well the answer is
Then he turned around and headed home again Slip slidin' away
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I used to lay my head My son don't need me yet
You cast your line and hope you get a bite
Abandoned now just like the war
While I looked around for my possibilities I was so hard to please
And they think that they have got the battle won
Whatcha knowin?
When I fell into a phone call
But what can be done? So God bless the goods we was given
No promises to keep
And these old hopes and fears
With the hunger of ambition
My wife came in and she said
Quiet as a sleeping army
Bonedigger Bonedigger
Getting old
Under African skies Little sleepy boy
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly
Written by Jackson C.Frank Catch a boat to England, baby,
These are the very words she uses
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
I don't know where I'm going
Stationed in Newport news
Guess what, paranoid
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
He said well I don't claim to be happy about this, boys
On the very same day I said hey Senorita that's astute
The cross is in the ballpark
They lie with you when you're asleep
But I feel you could It was in the early morning hours
But if I could release my heart
Proof
They know not what they've done 'Cause as sure as the sun will shine
But I'm reconciled Oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna be up for a while
But she moves on She says Ã¢??Ooh my storybook lover
Face to face, in the vastness of space
We all will be received
I am an island. And a rock feels no pain,
As if she'd captured the breath of my
His path was marked
I can think at all
Cannot substitute for tears Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
If the plans were changed You can beat us with wires
By a jury of my peers
And I said yeah Maybe I think too much
The harder they'll fall, wanna know Many rivers to cross
I was wearing my brown suit
Oh still crazy after all these years Four in the morning
Then that's good luck, runnin' through young veins
You guys would still be on my case But he can't leave his fears behind
And brought them all together for one night
Mexico
But just let some white boy die
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
You can't remember where you are
Well, I have no opinion about that
But you know you can't outrun the history train
I'd like to hock it A young girl in a parkin' lot
Maybe to Spain,
The future is the present
Call me Al A man walks down the street
My little town, my little town. Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Exaggerating this exaggerating that
Born at the right time No I would not give you false hope
Well it's a short walk, in a sweet breeze I will need you, feed you,
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
Wherever I've been and gone,
When I come back to bed
Yes boss, Mr. Stillwater
And met the morning sun Maybe I think too much
Raise your weary wings against the rain, my baby
We're not old
Voice in a bottle
The mothers and the fathers
You'll be lost and love will find you
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary
But I think it's all overdone
All right in a sort of a limited way
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me Blues Run the Game Lyrics
With a sad and simple face
And I don't care I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed
My mama loves, she loves me
I'm begging you please to come home
Oh, what a garden of delight
Comin' from the room next door
My mom doin' the laundry, hangin' out shirts in the dirty breeze.
It's an occupation where the wind prevails
Oh Still crazy after all these years I'm not the kind of man
And sometimes even music
They wondered where to begin
To prayers of devotion
A slide in a slide projector
I remember there's a radio
I'm just weary to my bones
I stand alone without beliefs
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
All your dreams are on their way.
We both will be received
By a lake of sacred water
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
In the company of strangers
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Go on and get some rest
And they shackled my legs
I don't want no part of this crazy love
And the grass was gray
Like the postcard
Strugglin to survive its harshest hour chorus
He is the child of my first marriage
It's such a drag to be on your own
And I have no opinion about that Sad as a lonely little wrinkled balloon
I've gone to look for America Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
The act was outrageous
I don't want no part of your love
Oh still crazy
I've got the Presidential Seal
And the night was black with smog
Winter sunlight hits the family tree
Weave their weary paths and die
They are handcuffs on the soul, my friends
I said take this child, Lord
That brushes the tops of the trees
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing After I died, and the makeup had dried
What information pertains
And the baby with the baboon heart And I believe
And high up above my eyes could clearly see
The baby curled up in a ball
And give no warning to her flight
And God bless the U. S. of A.
And all of these spirit voices rule the night Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I can't for the life of me
Little boy
In restless walks she'll prowl the night
As if through reading glasses
I was underage in this funky bar
And all of these spirit voices rule the night He was my brother
Well, I entered the courtroom, state of New York
Memphis Tennessee
It's a wonder
In the back of my head She said there's something about you
I am shielded in my armor,
Clothed in crinoline, of smoky Burgundy
The way we look to us all, oh yeah The way we look to a distant constellation
Life, I love you, All is groovy. Time, time
Long past the midnight curfew
We come on the ship that sailed the moon
My thoughts are many miles away
Roll across the skies
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
Is another man's floor There's been some strange goin's on
I am following the river
July she will fly
Then the moon breaks
Feel so blessed
For my fingers
Simply pretend that you can build them again Look around
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?
(Blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains)
Through the long and speechless night
To blow against the wind
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Dominates the right
The newspapers and the TV crews
