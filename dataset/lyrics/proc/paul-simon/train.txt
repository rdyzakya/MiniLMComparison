People hearing without listening,
You can wear your summer clothes
But I don't know where
You know the nearer your destination
A girl I can't forget
And certainly misused
I'm afraid that I will disappear Slip slidin' away
Don't be afraid Your days won't end with night
You got to fill out a form first
Their hearts and their bones
Who denies his urge to break and run Who says: Hard times?
And we sat among our photographs
And then there's all that weight to be lost
I held your hand And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
Wherever I have played
That split the night
Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather (War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)
The way that I loved you
Lives a former talk-show host
The only truth I know is you. And as I watch the drops of rain
Take me away
It's everybody jump start
You gotta make the moment last
But I feel you could - I was having this discussion in a taxi heading downtown The smartest people in the world
These prayers are
She loves me like a rock
And I guess she thought
She seemed so glad to see me
We shall suffer no more
From Tucson Arizona
Don't cry It's a turn-around jump shot
My sweet imagination
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
As if I'd never noticed
Looking back through the cracks in the door
Amen, amen, amen
Or cut him till he cried out
That's why we must learn to live alone Down among the reeds and rushes
You guys would still be on my case
I was playing my guitar
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Hello darkness, my old friend,
When you're on the street,
With the sunshiny hair, like a homecomin' queen I said, "Hey, what you say?
Everything looks worse in black and white Kodachrome
And I seen that girl as the road to my survival I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know Just later on the very same night
And there's music in the street
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
Shook some hands then adios Brooklyn amigos
And the automatic earth These are the days of miracle and wonder
She was married to someone
She burns in bed
The thought that life could be better
Come with me
Seed you, plead with you
There was no sign of God just to usher me in
When I thought I heard this voice say
He had a son
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
The 'Spanish boys' had their day in court room Sal
Still crazy after all these years Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
Wanna know
Dogs in the moonlight
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma The phone is ringing and I realize
Wherever I have gone,
Far away my well-lit door
All lies and jests
And Betty when you call me
Well they shackled my hands
When my restlessness is past
I'm sailing right behind.
And music is my trade
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
And I thought I heard a fall
I will comfort you.
I went back to my place
First time I heard â??Satisfactionâ??
We walk
He holds no currency
Call my name The first time I heard â??Peggy Sueâ??
And we don't know where Half of the time we're gone
No one here, likes a sneak You got to fill out a form first
We'll wake up down in
Let us say it's for the child
How terribly strange to be seventy Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears Well I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
Nobody knew from time to time
And no one dared
Hearts and bones Thinking back to the season before
We were staying up all night And giving the days away
I watch the night receive the room of my day
Calling old friends on the corners
And tenement halls"
Every time it registers another birth But down among the reeds and rushes
The mean individual had vanished in the black of night! Lord I am a working man
People aware of my history
And I sang it twice
Than what you've got planned Carry your cup in your hand
When you came into my life
Run that body down?
They shot my brother dead
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun
And we drank ourselves some beers
Begin before the bells of twilight peal
Now many wars have come and gone
In a deep and dark
I am a rock,
Everybody thinks it's true Well eventually the boy and the girl get married
Getting old We celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas day
Adios pisanos, adios You got to learn how to fall
It was against the law The mama look down and spit on the ground
I'm going to sing it three times more
If the plans where changed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
Though it seems strange to say
This town's gonna be your buryin' place He was singin' on his knees
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
A silver moon above my head
In a taxi heading downtown
Everybody was gunning
Ain't got no rain
I got a Nikon camera
Going to the candidates debate
The more you're slip slidin' away I know a father
The grass is high
To the meadow in the mountain
For who I am
Or what is it
She moves on But feel the bite
And we talked about some old times
The airports disagree
I will lay me down. Sail on silvergirl,
And I have no opinion about me Somebody could walk into this room
And he carries the reminders
By the stars in the Southern Hemisphere
I know you've been eager to fly now
I play the ace of spades
Easy time will determine if these consolations
They fell apart
Softer than the rain I wandered empty streets, down past the shop displays
I have squandered my resistance
Just drop off the key, Lee
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter April come she will
And I may be obliged to defend
I know that I am like the rain
I miss those soft places
He had a heart like a bone
How long you think you can
The screams are carried by the wind
Sometimes I see your face
The mean individual had vanished in the black of night
And people forget what a child's life is worth On the side of a hill, a little cloud weeps
Do you habla inglese? Am I understood Yes I am an alien from Mars
No deadly nightshade, Belladonna
As long as one and one is two wooo
I am remembering a girl when I was young
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
And these streets
While the little cloud weeps on the side of a hill Joseph's face was black as night
The spider resumes the rhythm
Maybe let us off the hook
Still remains
And many times confused
To cross into another neighborhood
Who calls herself the human trampoline
Proof is the bottom line for everyone I am heading for a time of quiet
Me and room service, honey,
And now it was time for some fuckin' law and order
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
For proof of love
Spend those Euro-dollars
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover She said it's really not my habit to intrude
We join the fevers
And better off left alone Well he stopped one night
In the mirror of a bad dream And for a fraction of a second,
But I feel you could
But the mean individual
When I ain't sleeping, honey,
Fading fast Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet
Life, I love you,
You can jingle to the beat
I miss my bed
The trailways bus is turning west
At any convenient time? Funny how my memory skips
Her eyes as clear as centuries
When tears are in your eyes, i will dry them all;
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
Satin summer nights
Looking over manuscripts
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day
And I dreamed I was flying
There could never be a father
I've got some real estate here in my bag
Sane people go crazy on you
I couldn't of been no more
But his catalog was sold First time I smoked
You cast your line and
I was walking with my dog
Who do you think you're fooling?"
Won't you close your weary eyes
But I know you'll soon be here We pull into downtown Dallas by the
Though my story's seldom told,
Before you learn to fly
And breakdowns go
And then you wait in the line After you climb, up the ladder of time
A loose affiliation of millionaires
People talking without speaking
Every love, every ending
Sail on by.
Marries all beginnings and conclusions And when they say
It's all over the evening news
Going home In the clearing stands a boxer,
And echoed
And I ain't scurrying
Well, I told her I was lost
Five years older than I
I'm used to them
You don't need to waste your time
And the Devil would call my name
Do-n-doh-d-doh-n-doh and here I am
I was walking through the Christmas tide
What's wrong sweet boy what's wrong?
I was all right
Singing sacred songs and reading from the Bible
And when the radical priest
Sera breve ou sera grande -- It will be brief or it will be great
Old familiar ways
Worryin' about the marketplace
Without the taste of your sweet love, Thelma
Silent night
Try to explain is a fragment of song Lord is it, be bop a lu la
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain
What if I die here
I do it for your love
To ask the Lord
But the fighter still remains, mmm mmm Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Me and Julio down by the school yard In a couple of days they come and
I hung one more year on the line
I just smiled
Sweeps the wild, white ocean Yes boss, the government handshake
Somebody please stop it Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
She loves me again,
About 1,500 years ago the messenger Mohammad spoke
There's some part of me wants to see
And they photographed the scene
But a heavenly light shone on my face Still I thought it was odd
Far and wide his name was known
And there's no doubt about it
I say forgive them Lord
On the evening news I don't want no part of this crazy love
Then she'll be a true love of mine
You don't need to be coy, Roy
And mama, mama it ain't no lie
The more you're slip slidin' away When I was a little boy
Some have died
That were messing up the lobby floor
I'm used to that
I do it for your love Found a rug
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me If I was President
Is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I just can't believe it's so
Me and room service
It's just like going fishin'
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
Oh the mother and child reunion
I do it for your love A passenger traveling quietly conceals himself
The words I speak in the middle of my night
Over the crest of the mountains the moon
But his christian name
So far away from home, so far away from home And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
We was all on the cover of Newsweek Yeah I'm on my way now
Under African skies This is the story of how we begin to remember
Hear my words that I might teach you,
And the broken bones The candlelight flickers
All the birdies in the trees
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
My mama loves me
That was the chance I took
Tell you something that you already know
Silver bells jingling from your black lizard boots, my baby
Well it makes your famous daddy
But we don't know where,
Yawning
Where we counted every falling star I believe a light that shines on you
And my poetry to protect me,
Lyin' underneath the stars
Because a vision softly creeping
For the things he'd done
Got to follow the rule
Dare lay a leaf on me
Hearts and bones Peace like a river ran through the city
And think of things that might have been Slip slidin' away
Then a voice from above
Wherever I throw those dice,
I don't expect to sleep the night
And his heart is racing with the urge to
See you me and Julio
Lookin' for fun and
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
Time, see what's become of me
And in the night
All I could think of was sunlight
Na forca do amanha -- In the power of tomorrow Lord of the earthquake
Like a thorny crown
We walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight
And the sun was beating
We take a walk
We sat starry-eyed
And I'll just stop all my trying. Catch a boat to England, baby,
And the pipes were old
I can be your long lost pal
Maybe it's his first time around
Wrap this child in mercy â?? heal her
That we could hold
Wherever I have gone
Not a negative word was heard
Let's keep it that way
From the people passing by
Learn how to fall Hello darkness, my old friend
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
And the sign flashed out its warning
But the mother and child reunion
Guilty by my dress
The only living boy in New York I get the news I need on the weather report
Feelin' groovy____________ Got no deeds to do
They're gonna divvy up the reward
Where I am He said 'cause that's not the way the world is baby
Just thankin' the Lord
Oo oo, Bernadette Dom dom dom doo
Lincoln Duncan is my name
That you're fading fast One and one-half wandering Jews
It was addressed from Vietnam
And all my friends stand up and cheer
And never leave till I leave you
And I see losing love
Slip slidin' away
She read her magazine
Parsely, sage, rosemary, & thyme
They've been going at it all night long
He is a foreign man
Is woven indelibly
Believe we're gliding down the highway
A mind wanders
And the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes
Mission music
Spiral, as a serpent's bed
For a long time, now
He hears music playing and Spanish spoken The border patrol outside of Tucson boarded the bus
The tank towns they tell no lie
Sera tudo ou sera naoa -- It will be all or it will be nothing
That ended a life at the age of seven years And the war rages on in the land called 'Somewhere'
She ran to the police station
He said there's not much more that you can do
The year was 1954
Sailing away to sea
Angel of Mercy, people are suffering
And I ain't no fool for love songs
When I was single
I'm gonna watch you shine
Though my words may be jumbled
But I never loved no one
I want a shot at redemption
To the neon God they made
I really remind you of money
Is only a moment away Oh the mother and child reunion
I got up to wash my face
When you awake Little boy
Falling on the children
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
Says â??Ah, What the hellâ?? Have a good time Paranoia strikes deep in the heartland
And call ourselves an institute You don't feel you could love me
Long been past
Feelin' groovy____________ Hello lampost
What you think about that? Well it seems like our fate to suffer
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (Woo, woo, woo)
Come to get me released
I'm with my boys
I don't know why I spend my time
Then she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Greatest story ever told Disagreements?
Is only a moment away Went to my doctor yesterday
So you'll always know
Maybe I think too much
Are written on the subway walls
Will be their reward
Had vanished in the black of night
And loving
Remember a sadder day
Never had to scuffle in fear
All over the world
Someone's taken my place Celia, you're breaking my heart
And this is what he said
If the clock don't jump off the wall
Going to stay til your resistance
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
He came from my home town
She called him Speedoo
Love on Earth is everywhere I was having this discussion
Struggling to survive
One time, the harder they come
When the world was young
And in the end we compromised
The sound
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Aren't bleeding me,
When you awake Little boy, little boy
Because he hated what was wrong He was my brother
And they won't come undone
Every time my name gets mentioned
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
In Graceland Slip slidin' away
I rest my head beside a white oak tree
Ten thousand people, maybe more
I will ease your mind.
And she loves me like a rock
Tapping on my roof and walls. And from the shelter of my mind
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Asking only workman's wages
Amen, amen
To resume old acquaintances
I'm traveling with this 5 piece band
The way the sun hits off the run way
Disturb the sound of silence "Fools" said I, "You do not know
Or ooh poppa do
So much older, Mama,
She gets down on her knees and hugs me
And when that light turned green
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
Then we rode that black mariah trough the streets of Spanish Harlem Salvador
Maybe not in my lifetime
I've come to talk with you again,
And he died so his brothers could be free
Only they would know Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
To analyze our love affair
God keeps his eye on us all.
I'd say "now who do
I know your part'll go fine
God makes his plans
Born at the right time Too many people on the bus from the airport
You're not
The cool, the cool river I believe in the future
Well I'm on my way
And this is what she wrote and said
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona
With the girl from the summer before It was the year of The Beatles
But I've reason to believe
Freedom
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair
They're just out to capture my dime
My traveling companion is nine years old
The splash of tears
Call me Al No I would not give you false hope
Se esmera, coracao -- Do your best, heart
Sonny gets sunnier
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson
Just like the rattlesnake sheds its skin Well they searched the roofs
He recalls each fatal thrust
Some people gonna call you up
Is down on the shelf
On this strange and mournful day
My radio tuned to
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
August die she must
I said who am I
She's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught
And once or twice I been on the floor
The more you're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away
The road is steep
My love for you's so overpowering
The cool, cool river
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town. Hey, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Hearts and bones
He died so his brothers could be free Begin again
I look around
I love to take a photograph
By the way how long you been dead?"
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
or driven to its knees
It's all gonna fade Now I sit by my window
And they checked out the groups
(Washed is the ground with so many tears)
Because a vision softly creeping,
And this is what he had to say
That you're not good enough
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report
This is the long distance call
We work our jobs
My time it'll be up some time in June
About the fifty ways She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
Sonny gets married and moves away
I am alone,
What I say now what I say now, ooh
And hey
I am an island. I have my books
Everything's the same back in my little town,
Spinning in infinity
And I'm afraid that I'll be taken
The memory of God And I believe in the future
River water, holy water
I drank a cup of herbal brew
And wishing I was gone,
Had to stand in the line
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Sloped into the room
Maybe some of them had hopes of seeing me again
But each time she withdrew
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo Saudocoes -- Greetings!
All that I once held as true
For the mother's restless son
Proof is the bottom line for everyone My face, my race
I should be depressed
You got to learn the routine
Tears can't bring him back to me
Wake up older
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
The shadow of the capitol dome
Just to explain
Maybe baby makes three
As I walked on And when you ran to me your cheeks flushed with the night
The information's unavailable
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
"The electric chair
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile
There's a former army post
I fall on the floor and I laughing, Jubilation,
Some people say the sky is just the sky
Who tends to socialize
Say "No man that was not
Loving's much the same,
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me
Won't you lay your body down
Conversations hard and wild But from time to time he makes her laugh
But I feel you could I was walking down the street
A baby girl was found
December,
You don't feel you could love me
He wonders what their life must be
I got to, I got to, I got to"
This is how I love you baby One and one-half wandering Jews
(forever)
Some guys were shooting pool
Writing songs I can't believe
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Her silky hair was brown Never been lonely
But it just don't work out that way
Why deny the obvious child?
And disregards the rest When I left my home and my family,
Let the music wash your soul (let it wash your soul)
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies Oo Little sleepy boy
Hope you get a bite But you don't need to waste your time
And all of these spirit voices rule the night By moon
And we are going to Graceland And my traveling companions
Her voice cracks
And we drove away
Little boy, little boy
To the brujo's door
They've all come to look for America
He says well this will eat up a year of my life
Of gazing at the stars above
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies Well I sang it once
Files for divorce
Tell her to find me an acre of land (On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)
We've lived so well so long
Are ghosts and empty sockets
we're traveling on
She moves on Slow down, you movin' too fast
You are on my mind,
The present's in the past
On the leaves of a banyan tree
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Fighting in Vietnam
Don't forget, he said to tell my sweet Mary
Dallas via Little Rock Oh my darling darling Sal
He longed to tell him all the reasons
He said I have no opinion about this
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
I'm exhausted from loving so well
When I ain't sleeping, Mama,
Accepted at the door Proof
Just get yourself free
About Mexico
Ooh the harder they come
They scrubbed off the sidewalk
A newspaper blowin' through the grass
Sera sujo, sera sonho -- It will be dirty, it will be a dream
When I'm near you my future seems bright Oh I want you to be my girl
But Johnny Ace is dead, yeah, yeah, yeah Well, I really wasn't
Became a wife
Resting in my arms again
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me.
They come running out their front doors
Da licenca um momento -- Excuse me, one moment
We smoked the last one an hour ago
Her golden lips as sweet as cherries And it came from
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
I said aren't you the women
And then the harder they come
And she loves me
Through the window of my eyes
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover Many rivers to cross
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I can call you Betty
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me
There are times I find myself
But I've heard the words before;
Make a new plan, Stan
There were incidents and accidents
And Buddha found nirvana along the lotus way
The highways are in litigation
That really reminds me of money
Of the golden retriever
And he walked the length of his days
I was no more than a boy
In the creases and the shadows
Gonna paint a sign
Is overcome
Of Jelly Roll Toomba, toomba, toomba, Mardi Gras
But I can't seem to find my way over
It's just apartment house sense
And I'm trying to get some rest
I am an island. I've built walls,
And they signed it on the bottom
Everybody got the runs for glory
Born at the right time Me and my buddies we are traveling people
Along the way the colors ran
I don't expect to sleep through the night
She moves on I know the reason I
Lives the former talk-show host
I'll never worry
The bomb in the baby carriage
Ever since the watermelon
I know what I know
I was young and unemployed
Buddy Holly still goes on
Down in the maroon light She says â??Maybe these emotions are
Just open your window
So I agree
And the sky is flecked with signs of hope
He says why am I soft in the middle now
I should go to bed
I've seen a glorious day Four in the morning
Genocide still goes on
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away If you took all the girls I knew
Oh, so this is what she means
Look around
Months old
Me and room service, babe,
Comin' home after school, flyin' my bike past the gates of the factories,
We come in the age's most uncertain hour
I said Peg you better look around
Washington, D.C. A mother and child, the baby maybe two
I love you And the breeze that wraps around you
With disagreements about the meaning of a marriage contract
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
Down by the school yard When I think back
Afraid to leave the projects
There's been a bloody purple nose
Got a short little span of attention
The harder they'll fall
Maybe it's the Third World
Leave your boy so far from home
My woman left me and she didn't say why
We had a lot of money
Hidin' under your bed
I was just my father's son. mmm.
Do what you been doin'
On all the crap I learned in high school
He says Amen! and Hallelujah! If you'll be my bodyguard
And waters the grave with its silent tears
Weren't that funny
Cattle in the marketplace
Ooh ooh
She was a high school queen
These tears are free
God bless the absentee Lord I am a surgeon
And tell me why
The papa said, "Oy, if I get that boy,
And an island never cries. The Mississippi Delta was shining
Just to glimpse the divine
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
People talking without speaking,
Slides across his face
Don't want to end up a cartoon
I got to, I got to go"
Holes in the knees of my jeans
His silky hair was brown Never been lonely
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
And then you wait in the line Okay, a new kid in school
'Til I leave you
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
With a magazine and a sleepless pillow
Give her the wings to fly through harmony
Consider that the Lord was there before creation
But I never opened up my door
And all of these spirit voices
Like a bridge over troubled water
Returned to their natural coasts
I am walking down the street
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain.
And she said losing love
Drank all the orange juice
He ducked back down the alley
His bones are soft
I ain't worrying
Like a National guitar
I don't lie when i speak Sal & Salvador
The rest of my life is so hard
The harder they'll fall, one and all Ooh, yeah, oh yeah, woah yeah ooh And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Learn how to fall You got to drift in the breeze
Without no seams nor needlework
And wait for the knowledge we seek
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain
Without a guide or walking stick
Nothing denied to
Hey, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
She once was a true love of mine Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
Love his daughter more than I love you Trust your intuition
She jumps back
Maybe my race has been run
And the world goes crazy for blood--latin blood
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
And pains is all around,
We like to go down to restaurant row
My heart still splashes
'Cause he left that neighborhood
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And I blew that room away The first thing I remember
Yes boss, the crusher of language
The moon is red
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore If you'll be my bodyguard
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Songs from the mouth of the river
There were times when I was so lonesome
Upstream
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
The only living boy in New York Fat Charlie the Archangel
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And the course of a lifetime runs
All that winter we shared a cold
Someplace down the line,
For the change inside the purse
Te lembro -- I remind you
It was the myth of fingerprints
From veins and arteries
A cloud shifts
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line
It's the spring time of my life Seasons change with the scenery
In Memphis Tennessee
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
I'm feeling all right
And he walked his days
Do you know what time it is?
Wisdom is old
Handcuffs on the soul
Be bop a lu la It was a slow day
The way the sun hits off the runway
On the last leg of a journey
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
Ooh-oowee, I was about as destituted as a kid could be
Go home outsider
In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed
And here's my song, here's my song My father was a fisherman
And we said these songs are true
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hear the Salvation Army band
And I reached for the phone by the side of the bed Now the first time that I saw you I thought
I say the joke is on her
Toomba, toomba, toomba, hey
The blues have run the game. Maybe when I'm older, baby,
But a voice in my head
I see them in the airport lounge
Send out for gin,
Two people were married
For an off-night
I left my home in the Maritimes
Lord, I recall, in my little town,
She burned like a bride
All the way from Washington to Tokyo
To the neon god they made
Down in the valley
Summer leaves and my birthday's here
Adam and Eve Moves like a fist through traffic
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
As long as one and one is two
In the quiet of the railway station,
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away Tom, get your plane right on time
They don't have no fun I don't believe what I read in the papers
The planet groans
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover If you ever awake
Scatterlings and orphanages
I am Sal Mineo and I need you so
In its wake
And the war was cold
Just a come-on from the whores
But it's all right, it's all right
Remember me to one who lives there
She loves me
When it's late in the evening
Rest my head upon that shore
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
Love is all I seek
And it curled into the circle of birth
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan You got to learn how to fall
I left a message at your hotel
And the music was flowing amazing
See you, me and Julio
Dom dom dom doo
The harder they'll fall one and all
Of unpublished rhyme Drinking my vodka and lime
Love his daughter more than I love you I'm gonna watch you shine
Maybe I think too much They say the left side of the brain
And whispered in the sounds of silence And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Like it shines on me
And I brought it home to you
The city is lit with candles
I don't want no part of this crazy love She says she knows about jokes
And your smile seems softer than it was Proof
Bright and bon vivant
I'm a consummated man
She needs to talk so
The harder they'll fall, one and all Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down
He made the mold Take your clothes off
My feet were lead
Cause if I can't sing my boy to sleep
I'm on my way I'm taking my time
If the wind don't break
These are the roots of rhythm
And billionaires and baby These are the days of miracle and wonder
Free to wander wherever they choose
The northern and the southern
Hey In my little town, I grew up believing
On the street last night
Sayin' "Here comes something, and it feels so good!"
And we stayed to close the place
That none may penetrate.
My mama was a fisherman's friend
All the favorite melodies If you leap awake
They're shining for you Bernadette Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan
She was his only girl
I long to see St. Judy's Comet
Doo Bee Doo Doo,
And though they were both occupied with the child she carried
You can call me Al A man walks down the street
Still at my side Anger and no one can heal it
Why deny the obvious child? I hear the drizzle of the rain
And the song ends
She moves on A sympathetic stranger
When you've got to choose
Look so dumb Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet
What I'm saying now somebody stop that war What I dream I had, dressed in organdy
The only living boy in New York,
With a sweet dream in your bed Chorus:
Well they'd kill you if they could Aurea & Women
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
Lives like a mole in a motel
Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone
So when I reached my prime
May she will stay
Your words disappear And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love,
As if I didn't know my own bed
With a sweet dream in your head I'm gonna watch you shine
And then you wait in the line Buddah and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat
Of a cappella groups, yeah
But the press let the story leak
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town. In my little town, I never meant nothin',
The voice of a star
All over the island tonight
I don't want no part of this crazy love If a baby is born and no one complains
I seem to lean on
And follow your memories
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
And whispered in the sounds of silence Over the mountain
Drink the rain
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Than living as a puppet or a slave So as sure as the sun will shine
Never been lied to
My life's a mess
Along a path of river stone
Said the judge to the court reporter Salvador
Why don't we drive through the night
Where some people congregate in shame
I was left without a penny in my pocket
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day
And she won't bother you no more This is the story of how we begin to remember
But all that remains when you
I'm having a good time Have a good time Maybe I'm laughing my way to disaster
I'm on your side. when times get rough
Women with their nursing children
Well, I'm tryin' to get some sleep
And all the music seeping through Celia, you're breaking my heart
Hemispheres Love emerges
I do declare,
They're all the same Well, the sun gets weary
And we walked off to look for America
Who'll be my role-model
Come on home Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
So what are you going to do about it That's what I'd like to know
The bride was contagious
Why should I?
If that's the way it's going to be
It's as harsh as night I'm gonna watch you shine
And the vision that was planted in my brain
The church bells chime
Is this my fault?
Even now that sweet memory lingers
Still, you don't expect to be
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
Singing late in the evening
For reasons I cannot explain
Disagreements had begun And in a while
As near to love as love will ever beâ??
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.
Was Mr. Earl Was a sunny day
I hear a voice inside my skin
Doot-in' doo-doo, Feelin' groovy. Got no deeds to do, No promises to keep.
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
When the papa found out he began to shout And he started the investigation
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) On the side of a hill in a land called 'Somewhere'
And then a wah wah wah wah wah wah wah
And we are going to Graceland
She rocks me like the rock of ages
Let your body heal its pain
It's not that the colors aren't there, it's just imagination they lack.
The Statue of Liberty
I'm gonna be up for a while C'mon take me to the Mardi Gras
I'll take your part.
A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
And friends just can't be found,
And say your life is on fire
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Ever since the world began
Of peace without illusions
You can't be forever blessed
But between the day you're born and when you die
The blues have run the game. Send out for whisky, baby,
We are time zones and oceans apart
Russians up in rocket ships
My mama loves me, she loves me
Sugar coated with love, said, "Let us begin" You got to fill out a form first
Don't cry It was a dry wind
You don't need to discuss much
After the dream of falling and calling your name out
And we don't know where Tom, get your plane right on time
And music is my knife
I woke up from out of my dreams
And we leave this loathsome little town
Why am I soft in the middle
You can run out your rules
Two people playing the game
In an old junk shop
Stranded in a limousine Then everybody came running
County of New York, just some spic
Leaves are brown
That eats at what you've got
You take two bodies and you twirl them into one
Is only a motion away Oh the mother and child reunion
And it disappears
It's just a little lump
Where the sage and sweet grass grow
I'll sing what I said
With words that tear and strain to rhyme. And so you see I have come to doubt
That's an easy thing to say
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Wouldn't play it by the book
And some folks have come and gone
And if life is a blessing
These are the days of lasers in the jungle
And he idle thumbs through the pages
Sweet Bernadette Whoa you got style from your hair to your heels
I've no money to come east
In the back of my head She moved so easily
Smiled reassuringly
And thinking of a rock and roll song
Old
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Well-a well I'm home Wop, wop, wop, wop
We come and we go
Gone Gone
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it
Into our hearts and our brains We were married on a rainy day
Going home
All along along
If I'd heard John Lennon had died And the two of us went to this bar
On this friend of mine who had A little bit of a breakdown
And I hadn't been playing that long When a man came on the radio
Wherever I have played,
Is like a window in your heart
When a stranger came up and asked me
Sparkle in your eyes
But I get no offers,
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
Wandering I am lost
Work 'em out The human race has walked the earth for 2.7 million
Step out occasionally
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)
Your time has come to shine.
Do-n-do-d-do-n-do and here I am,
From the mountain's melted snow
'Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
Misinformation followed us like a plague
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
As if I didn't know that
They said mama, oh! Papa, oh!
Depende coracao -- It depends, heart
But she just shook her head You got to fill out a form first
We were satisfied And I remember
Everybody thinks it's true What is the point of this story
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
To describe her life
I've seen them all and man
Who you foolin? He was a mean individual
He came a long way
I never been laid so low
Well-a well I'm home
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me...
To England where my heart lies. My mind's distracted and diffused
And I merely survive because of my pride And this loneliness won't leave me alone
Ah, I told her what's wrong
A love once new has now grown old Couple in the next room bound to win a prize
Leading me,
And it's not just you This is all around the world Over the mountain
A shepherd resting with his flock
When the road bends
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These events may have had some effect
And blowing my way On a cold December evening
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a "J"
And looking back down at me
To the mortal man
What I'm saying now somebody stop that war Oh yeah, oh yeah
You got to make the morning last.
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
And generals order their men to kill
I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
And slept on the banks
No matter what I do
And the roots of rhythm remain Joseph's face was as black as the night
Why deny the obvious child? And in remembering a road sign
For my fingers I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know When you're weary, feeling small,
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
And I can't catch it back But I feel good
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.
Spanish blood
She said don't I know you
Slides through the metal detector
Staccato signals of constant information
Is only a motion away
Rainbows in the high desert air
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
Guilty in the press
So I looked at the scenery
Just kicking down the cobble stones.
At a traffic light
Like a memory it falls
I said breakdowns come
Oh, but mistress Brown your son is dead And it came from
He doesn't speak the language
I've come to talk with you again
Fall on your yesterday's heart If the sun don't shine
But proof, yes
And though I know you're fighting it
Oh I
The deal we made
They give us the greens of summers
I want you to be my movie
And speculate who had been damaged the most
It seems mindless, but it does
And what is more
And I watch the cars
I'm on my way now, I'm taking my time
The more you're slip slidin' away I know a woman
But I'm all right, I'm all right
And say Man you're old
And we estimate the universe at 13-14 billion
So all you 'partment fools
Rearranging my position
And I dreamed I was flying We come on the ship they call the Mayflower
When the perfect circle
Everybody thinks it's true Two disappointed believers
And the dead sand
Is only a moment away When the mama pajama rolled out a bed
This time the joke is on me
She moves on She says â??Ooh my storybook lover
Somebody please stop that war now It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
Are often mistaken for one and the same Now the man and the woman they remain in contact
My sex, my cheques
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny
And every song we played
With nothing left to lose Was a sunny day
Both night and day Hurry take me to the Mardi Gras
Remember: one man's ceiling
They started a long time ago
I trade my tears
Everybody sees the wind blow In Graceland, in Graceland
I said what does that mean
All the favorite melodies Her name was Lorelei
And get yourself free A winter's day
The harder they'll fall, one and all
My life's so common it disappears
Woah, there's a girl over there
Maybe I think too much Soon our fortunes will be made, my darling
Born at the instant
Gazing from my window to the streets below
The harder they'll fall, one and all Yeah, the harder they come
Well, she took me to the woods
Twitchin' like a finger on the trigger of a gun. Leavin' nothin' but the dead and dying back in my little town.
Their uninvited guest Never been lonely
The way we look to us all The way we look to a distant constellation
Down the decades every year
Faith is an island in the setting sun
I've come to watch your flowers growing.
Of his golden tread
Such a Johnny Ace fan
Depende da paixao -- It depends on the passion
Fly down to Mexico
Well-a well I'm home Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop I feel good
Who you foolin? I came back home and I went to bed
There's been some hard feelings here
The blancos and the nigger gangs
The sweetness in the air
To blow against the wind I know what I know
It's against the law
The Blood of Christ Mountains
She fights a fever
I come looking for a job,
I was 12 years old
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
And the roots of rhythm remain In early memory
When the mother and child reunion
Sera util, sera tarde -- It will be useful, it will be late
Parsely, sage, rosemary & thyme
I can't help it, I wonder what went wrong And I dreamed I was dying
Phantom figures in the dust
I don't want no part of your love Fat Charlie the Archangel
Is another man's floor
Get these mutts away from me
Had vanished in the black of night Hey hey hey hey
A siren, a flashing light
There but for the grace of you go I I met my old lover
The speeding planet burns
Still I'm telling you just how it feels I love you
Well I guess, I have to try Many rivers to cross
Over and over again But I would not give you false hope
And it was late in the evening
My father came to me
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
Music is the tongue I speak
Where the leader fell and a town was broken
The constant road across the wilderness
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Oh, oh, oh
She once was a true love of mine. We sailed up a river wide as a sea
He'd tip his heart
The Lord God is here
I'm going to Graceland
A heavy belt around my waist to restrain me Sal
A little boy lies asleep in the earth
I may live in my car
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
The valley below
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
I'm up on the Presidential Podium
Through hills of gold
In Graceland She comes back to tell me she's gone
All over the world Sal
There's a mean individual stranded in a limousine Then everybody came running
In such a mysterious way
And don't cry baby, don't cry
But I felt bad all the same
And release my fists at last I am heading for a time of solitude
For proof of love If only for the explanation
Day by day by day by day I've been waking up at sunrise
I can tell when you rub your eyes
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
The falcon calls
Inside my chest, but she
Over and over again No I would not give you false hope
The Koran is old
Had gathered in Los Angeles
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
Are traveling together
Feel the sun
Was for The Late Great Johnny Ace, yeah, yeah, yeah Yesterday it was my birthday
And it's not just you This is all around the world Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere
There was a bright light
Narrow streets of cobblestone
And though my lack of education
Whoa you're the smile of the moon Bernadette Dom dom dom doo
The only living boy in New York Half of the time we're gone
One fine day
I know they say let it be
And just like a dog I was befriended, I was befriended Oh, oh, what a night
Is another man's floor And there's an alley
I don't know nothin' about nothin'
I know they'd never match
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
The more you're slip slidin' away I know a man
Combined with the lightness in my head
And when I came back to the room
You can call me Al
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome
It cuts away my sorrow
And a fighter by his trade
I touch no one and no one touches me.
Everybody said Lord, Lord!
Darkness fills with light
Bathe beneath a waterfall of light
I've got a hiding place in central park
He was a naturally crazy man
And my mother laughed
But in yours I feel sure
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
And get yourself free She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
So I sent away for his photograph And I waited till it came
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam Yesterday I got a letter from my friend
Where's my wife and family
Down by the riverside's
Believing I had supernatural powers
Though I know you're fighting it
And these prayers are
Paul you better look around
She said
It's like apartment rents
Preparing to leave the house of D.
Seated on the floor
Maybe you, maybe me
And some bloody purple clothes
Phantom figures in the dust Whoa I got time on my hands tonight
I said I have no opinion about that
The road ahead
They follow me with open eyes
But I'm having a good time I've been loving and loving
Cuidado, coracao -- Be careful, heart
Well, we'll just have to wait and confer I don't want no part of this crazy love
Parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme
The more you're slip slidin' away God only knows
I was living in London
Running out their back doors
Not a cloud was in the sky
Weaving time in a tapestry
A baby boy was found
Thelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall I will need you, feed you,
On the man with the girl by his side
And the moon rose over an open field Cathy, I'm lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping
All come to look for America I was reading a magazine
Mothers weep, sisters grieve Sal
Too many holes in the crust of the earth
She said I seem to be OK
All about the fire in your life
Time passes
She says the joke is on me
And for a fraction of a second
Well, it's not just me
I heard a racket in the hall
Disturb the sound of silence "Fools", said I, "You do not know
I said why don't we get together
Still as prayer
And I can lie down on my blanket
Who could say things that
From the Late Great Johnny Ace, yeah, yeah, yeah It was the year of The Beatles
Nowhere to go but back to sleep
E confia -- And have trust
How it's strange that some roots are like cages
And God bless the standard of livin'
And kiss you when you start your day. And a song I was writing is left undone
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding
The more I searched
Abandoned, forsaken
That's all I'm trying to get some rest Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends
He was old she was young From time to time
These days are ours
She takes the corner that's all she takes
And my long years of innocence ended
An angry mob trailed along
He was a mean individual
Medicine is magical and magical is art
I need a photo-opportunity
In the city of my dreams
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma If the heart is an open memory book
Was preaching to a crowd
Silence like a cancer grows
The rage of love turns inward
And the radio's singing song
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
But you feel it
And after it rains there's a rainbow and all of the colors are black.
The answer is easy if you take it logically
And down along the avenue
She is the kind of a girl
And the sign flashed its warning,
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah Then I learned to play some lead guitar
When evening falls so hard
My trembling bed
I don't want no part of your love I don't want no part of this crazy love
You can mingle in the street
It came all the way from Texas
I ask the Lord
Still crazy
The arc of a love affair
God is old
September I remember
And we'll all have a good time Have a good time Slow down, you move too fast.
In a cartoon graveyard
Who was recently given a Fulbright
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
I said I'm gonna get that girl
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Negotiations and love songs
Oh I love you, girl Oh, I love you She was beautiful as southern skies the night he met her
You're fading fast
I will ease your mind. She looked me over
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
He looks around, around
I heard cathedral bells, tripping down the alley ways
What I say now what I say
Where the dancing is elite
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
Worryin' about the market place
The blues, they're all the same. The first thing I remember
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Up in my bedroom (making love)
I'm with my troops, yeah
Still crazy after all these years
It's just apartment house rules
The plane lifts
I do it for your love The rooms were musty
In the mirror of a bad dream
It was nineteen 1964
There's a place I want you to see When the leaves are dark
And the sun goes down
and sing an American tune
Where we counted every falling star I believe the light that shines on you
But mistress Brown your son is dead And it came from
As you shortly will discoverâ?? Then I fall to my knees
Sure enough they have a son
Don't cry, don't cry Many's the time I've been mistaken
I was lying in my bed
Hasn't hurt me none
I will lay me down.
Hop on the bus, Gus
That's a thing that I keep
She cooks a meal of two
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me When I was grown to be a man
June she'll change her tune
He wore his passion for his woman
Where the people sing and play
Don't let management poison the well I will need you, feed you,
All the favorite melodies He was a navy man
And the current is strong
And worse I am heading for a place of quiet
Running scared,
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Waiting to be restored
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
It was against the law
With a rattling deep emotion
But these motel walls are cheap
Everybody just seemed to move
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hang on to your hopes, my friend
There's nothing scary hiding under your bed
I come to earth from outer space
I'm accustomed to a smoother ride
How many nights you think you can
You can legalize your lows
And when I wear that starry crown
How long you think that you can
The cool, the cool river
Begins its climb And he wakes to find he's in rolling farm land The farmer sleeps against his wife
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away The problem is all inside your head she said to me
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
See how they shine.
I wonder what went wrong
For the mean individual
God bless the absentee Was a sunny day
Don't matter anymore
And the whole world whispering
Love his daughter more than I love you A man walks down the street
Everybody knows his name He says there's no doubt about it
While down in the valley a cruel war rages
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair
And the lights come up On the black pit town
If you need a friend
If I never loved I never would have cried.
Don't be alarmed, she told me the telegram said
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Crapped out
And the music's seeping through The next thing I remember
But wooo I knew better Salvador
I'm gonna stick him the house of detention"
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
It was the year of The Stones
There could never be a father who loved
And the sky is a coat of diamonds There's a wooden cross over my bed
And the elevator man don't work no more
Where the New York City winters
The more I shook for Thelma Last night I slept on a rented pillow
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Or struggled from here to get there
Silver foil to trim your wedding gown It's true the tools of love wear down
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy. Hello lamppost, What cha knowing?
Of New Mexico
They give us those nice bright colors
Hearts and bones Whoa whoa whoa
Bound to be a better ride
And though I cant guarantee
If only for the consolation
And I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
The sky was yellow
And it swept across the desert
The face at the edge of the banquet
And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw
When I crept to her tent with a flashlight
Through the cradle of the civil war
Waiting for me when I die
Before you set your sails
Lord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do
In her cold coffee eyes She can't sleep now
In Graceland There is a girl in New York City
In the Sangre de Christo
All is groovy____________________ When I think back
The way some ladies do
In the back of my head I am just a poor boy
See what I have seen
x2 There's been some hard feelings here
I'd say "who do
When darkness comes
Just to lay our prayers upon them Crying adios pisanos, adios
He was my brother
He is surrounded by the sound
They cursed my brother to his face
In the words that it was forming
Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years
Upon their mother's breast
Trying to help the human race
Was a sunny day
I'm a consecrated boy
And I don't seem to be happy about that I don't want no part of this crazy love
Was wired to the radio These are the days of miracle and wonder
There were hints and allegations If you'll be my bodyguard
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Savin' my money, dreamin' of glory,
Love is all I seek And when at times my words desert me
The orange bled the blue The sting of reason
And if I traveled my whole life
Some even said that my judge Judge Gerald Culkin
People writing songs that voices never share
I have a wife and family, don't see much of me
How about you son you like you've got
