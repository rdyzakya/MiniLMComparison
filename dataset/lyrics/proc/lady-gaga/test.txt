I scream Mom and Dad
I wanna be the grave and earth you (oh yeah)
This time I'm not leaving without you You say sit back down where you belong
They like the way I'm walkin'
Won't look at you
It won't be real
I wish I could be strong
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
I'm on the right track, baby
Till you find your dream A dream that will need
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops
To take me from you
But I'm a loser in love
I'm sorry, and I love you
Loosen your hips and get a dress to wear
Bikini tops, poppin' off
Nein Zedd!
If you want me you can watch me on your
What am I supposed to do? How can you deal with it (With it)
Dont bother me, Alejandro
Put on a pretty little number
gonna re-repeat myself so I know that yall are listening. Cher and Lady Gaga:
(My heart just speaks to me)
Who's that chick? who's that chick? The hills are alive,
Oh boy you've left me speechless
Buy us drinks in bars
(More than I can say)
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha
I'm singin'
Want your bad romance It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers
That you'll never loose Love is the new
But, baby, he's already caught them
I still feel the blow
Last night
I like it, like it. S, S, S & M, M, M
Givin' me a million reasons
Stay
Goddess of love, goddess of love Take me to your planet (to the planet)
And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place
From a church on a breeze To laugh like a brook
I felt you touchin' me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
High like amphetamine
I need you more than dope [Verse 1]
Mars, now serve for the gods
God forgive my sins
Pretend that I am you until it clicks
How, how It's not how big, it's how mean
I'm old school and you're so new
You don't need permission I, I wish that I could dance
Baby you'll be, just my summer boyfriend
Maybe we can see world together
You'll be my G.I.R.L
And I'll sing once more Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Don't you know my ass is famous?
We fell in love, but not in court (La-la-la-la-la-la-la) I don't sp', I don't sp'
Callin' like a collector
For a thousand years The hills fill my heart,
Baby cause you blow my heart up Groove. Slam. Work it back. Filter that. Baby bump that track.
Find your freedom in the music
'Cause baby, you were born this way No matter gay, straight or bi
Now he's gonna find a fight, gonna fool the bad You know that I love you boy
On your video, video
(After-Chorus) (Verse 3 (Iggy Azalea):)
No, no, no, no don't you try to catch me
When it trips and falls
Hurry up before I change my mind Hey there summer boy
Here I go
Just smoke my cigarette and shush.
Yeah at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
Ass low ass low (Chorus)
That I don't stand a chance, a chance I just wanna be myself
But in the cultural sense
Don't you leave me
Because I'm best when I'm in love, and I'm in love with you Touch me touch me
(Muh muh muh muh) P p p poker face, p p p poker face
or what was said to make you cry.
I know it's pulling me apart
Touch me touch me, don't be sweet
Put the knife under the hood If you find it
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
Re-ke-re-ke-reverse I'm so starstruck
And own you (oh yeah)
But I'm not sure
I'll never write a song
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriends limo
Doin' the love game I'm on a mission
I won't stop until the sun is up oh yeah
The girl under you guy I wanna be that guy (G. U.Y.)
Ro mah ro-mah-mah
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
(Let your body jiggle)
Build a house or sink a dead body Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together
Its me that feels this way
I won't cry for you (Gaga), see (Gaga)
In the dark she loves, she loves to dance in the dark Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
Could you give it all up? If I promised boy to you
Under you, like a G.U.Y. (Chorus)
When I got the whole world in front of me So I said, "I don't wanna be alone forever
I cut lines, you wait your turn
Slay, slay You've got company
Boy you were getting ready to leave
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
'Cause I feel so trashy
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. [Chorus]
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Bridge]
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
Does it seem we have even make sense?
It don't have a price
What you want with my body! You can't have my heart and
Baby don't you leave me Hey girl, hey girl
No it won't be real
Want your bad romance (caught in a bad romance) want your bad romance I want your love and
I close my eyes
Who's that chick? who's that chick?
In my fishnet gloves
And your cigarette stained lies Could we fix you if you broke?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
And I want you to know, I am my hair I've had enough, this is my prayer
And after all, it's just another day And after all it's just another day Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Scheiße, Scheiße be mine, Scheiße be mine When I am on a mission
With your half wired broken jaw
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure) I'll fix you with my love Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
And after all, it's just another day Come on, Mark Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman We both know I could learn a thing or two
'Cause I'll be dancin'
When I call, they better see me
Oh, can you hear me singin'? Baby don't cry
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams I can't believe how you looked at me
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
You'll be fine
In electric chapel Ho oh oh oh, ho oh oh oh
Hold your head up and be strong
(Muh muh muh muh) Red One, Konvict, Gaga (oh, yeah) I've had a little bit too much, much oh oh woah!
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
Of all my wrecked up friends I'll never talk again
I may not walk on your street
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Glamaphonic, electronic, disco baby
(It's the feel of ecstasy) Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
Don't call my name, Alejandro
Huh oh
Maybe someone I love could save me from myself
You're not gonna reach my telephone
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a mess
Its D.R.U.G.S. we got cash
Head full of Jameson
I wish you the best on your way, eh
Never let you fall apart
Your brown eyes Hush up
What's going on on the floor?
Her love for him ain't cheap
I can't help, I keep on dancing
Leave the coffin open when I go
And you know that I need you
He ate my heart (wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell) He licked his lips, said to me
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night
Together we'll dance in the dark Baby loves to dance in the dark
Who's that chick? who's that chick? Back on the dancefloor better not to take me home
Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh So happy I could die and it's alright
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud) (A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor baby
Oh, I feel so low from living high My heart would break without you
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair
Something you gotta I know,
In electric chapel
Aphrodite lady seashell bikini (get with me)
You knew that I was free
Video phone VERSE:
Now show me your fangs
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Outro]
Dum dum da da da
Boy I can forget the way you were with me
You'll never have to wait your turn
Won't know how it feels 'Til it happens to you, happens to you
Somewhere in all the confusion
Baby, I just need one good one to stay You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
It's always harder
your destiny of self but Artpop could mean anything
Give it up just let your body Out of control
Crazy, get your ass in my bed
Papa-paparazzi I'll be a girl backstage at your show
I know I fucked up again
We were so young we could grow.
The touch of your hand
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
I found an old pair of
Donatella, Donatella 'Cause she walks so bad, like it feels so good
How could you talk?
Papa-paparazzi
Lets go for a run
With a guitar humming and no clothes
I don't speak your, I don't speak your Americano (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You left me speechless, so speechless baby Will you ever talk again?
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely Tap down those boots while I beat around
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad
With your James Dean glossy eyes
I'mma put you in my move if you think that you can handle
Show me your teeth (the truth is sexy) Tell me something that'll save me
Seemed like a real perfect fit,
Keys in my purse that opened
Love-love-love, I want your love (Love-love-love, I want your love) You know that I want you
Press record and baby, film me On your video phone
Rock, make it rock
The sun is creepin' up again
I fell down, I wish you were mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh,
Dink in link in, sand-script with a fan
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
Ale-ale-jandro Don't bother me,
What, you want me naked?
Open in the islands
Space cowboy, Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga
I wonder if this could be love (Venus) Have an oyster, baby, it's Aphrod-isy
Get the breakdown first
You ought to pity me 'cause was always one man to love
You're just a ani-
So want my lipstick all over your face
We both won't act like someone else
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks
All of the people start to rush, start to rush by.
I want your love I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick
Ford ev'ry stream
Is underneath my Christmas tree
And you're not gonna reach my telephone Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus]
I want your revenge
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby
Listen to me when I say I'm beautiful in my way
Do ya I know I know I know I know you want me
Down the street that I love
Earth, serve for the stars! When you touch me, I die
And eh, there's nothing else I can say
In electric chapel Come dance to me where you have been
Baby, baby loves to dance in the dark
Why can't I be who I wanna be?
Got my flash on it's true
Bang bang, my baby shot me down Put some lipstick on
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
(I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks and, oh my god-- [laughs]) Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
Do what you want with me
We like boys in cars
If you can deal with me,
Where we can both fall far in love I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Forgive him before he's dead because I won't cry for you
Your papa-paparazzi
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
You've left me speechless, so speechless How? Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow
P p p poker face, p p poker face
Light me up put me on top, let's falalalalalalala The only place you wanna be
I stand up
I tried crossing out your words But baby you can not forget the past
Wo-wo-wobble wobbin'
Groove. Slam. Work it back. Space cowboy just play that track.
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
I wrote you this lullaby
Listen to her radiate her magic
I need it
Aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, fräulein uske-be clair Love is just a history that they may prove
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('cause I'm broken)
Damn you were in my sex dreams
I want your love and
Don't want no paper gangsta Greetings from himeros
I think of him, I think of him [Speaking]
The girl under you (guy) I don't need to be on top
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Brushes with darkness wont help you create
Goin', girl? Honestly, I know where you're goin'
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh Call all you want, but there's no one home
And I know that you may love me
Do what you want (with my body) [Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law Here we go I can't wait to smoke them all
Guy, I'm romance and love's to hold you (oh yeah)
And we lay in the club like we don't give a fuck [Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Wanna meet at my place?
Just ask your gay friends their advice, before you
(Mount your goddess)
And baby, you're just movin' on
I think of him, I think of him I can't believe I'm telling you this but
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel I'm gon' be manicured
Whoa woa
So put your dreams up for Nebraska
Lesbian, transgendered life
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure) I'll fix you with my love You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
know no matter what, what, what.
The way she moves the way she walks
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
Back of the club, taking shots, getting naughty
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor Stop callin', stop callin'
Nothing to lose Don't call my name
I'm skinny
Scheiße, Scheiße be mine,
You can see that I got it goin' on
I'm not gonna cry anymore
'Til it happens to you, you won't know
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way Don't be drag, just be a queen
Dont call my name
Baby I'd rather die
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
I won't crucify the things you do
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say
I need direction
I shoulda left my phone at home
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover
She wear burqa for fashion
Love junkie on a three-day bender
Sometimes I feel like
Just remember that I always got you with me
And I'm a little bit of a bitch I wanna dress you up in silk, Taffeta
Your leader, your leader (to the planet)
She so star struck, the gal all stuck
Ale-ale-jandro Alejandro
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
(Where are you, 'cause I can't see you
The size of them's more than enough Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Come on, come on, come on
I wanna be your g. U.y (yeah)
Like a serial killer, man is a goner (man cured) Touch me in the dark
I'm laying down on famous knives so everybody sees Bleach out all the dark
'Cause this is a disaster
And you know that too Yeah you can see clearly
Fashion, fashion! In your brown eyes, walked away
Goin', girl? If you could I know that you'd stay
(Let's slow it down)
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
Beating like a disco drum... beating like a disco drum... [Chorus]
Mirror on the ceiling
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
We'll haunt like Liberace
Duh-duh-duh dance, dance, dance, just dance. How, how, how, how, how I can't believe what you said to me
Won't even sing along
Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
Touch me, touch me, don't be sweet
Hog sweat it out you squealer
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud
Just for tonight Even though I'm red, you are blue
Into our love storm Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Ah ah ah ah ah America Americano, ah ah ah ah ah America Americano Don't you try to catch me, don't you try to catch me
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as In the most Biblical sense,
And eh, there's nothing else I can say (Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say
Leave nothin' on these streets to explode
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Yes I've got my,
And you're not gonna reach my telephone We're sorry the number you have reached is not in service at this time
Won't make me leave no faster
Put your hands all over my body parts
Subway kid, rejoice of truth
She hides true love
I like you a lot lot, think you're really hot hot
What do you wanna wear this spring?
Could show you all the reasons why
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Then suddenly the kunst is me
We're plastic but we still have fun! I'm your biggest fan
Let's go to the party heard our buddy's the DJ
And a game, and a game, and a game, a love game Let's play a love game, play a love game
Our physical dream
Oh baby it's so cruel but
Bad bitches
Hey girl, do you feel me?
I wish that I was strong
Got our romance and loves to hold you
When you're cold, I like to burn
When we used to be
Held hands like we were seventeen again
I'm gonna smoke Marlboro Lights and drink Champagne
Put the knife under the hood
She's a mess she's a mess
I don't wanna talk anymore
We'll still have the summer after all Hey there summer boy
Thought we had already won
I'm rich,
All the broken hearts
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more, oh-uhh. -Chorus, 1x- Na-na-na come on, come on
I like boys and that is that
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in Come to mama
Yeah we're going nowhere fast
Come alive In the fire I call your name out (call your name out, call your name out)
Do you remember where we stayed Last time we where hanging out
And this dance is on you One, five, ten, lay a million on me
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair I just want to be free, I just want to be me
(Something), something, something about just knowing when it's right
'Cause until you walk where I walk
I hear you screaming
Can you handle it? (Tell 'em, B)
Tonight, tonight, tonight Groove. Slam. Work it back. Filter that. Baby bump that track.
Get on top of me
(Eh, eh) Wish you never looked at me that way
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
But you choose "death and company"
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I have something that I love long-long so-long
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
It's all the glory that I bare
Ale-ale-jandro
Take a bite of my bad girl meat (bad girl meat)
