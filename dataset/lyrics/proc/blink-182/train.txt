And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me This is the first (thing I remember)
Left alone to wonder (Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
Just like last time, but a little worse, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
I need a girl that I can train She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
(The last train home)
West Side Humboldt 7am
You fucked up my life Im kicking out fiercely
There goes the sunrise
Oh, is this thing on? I swear that I can go on forever again
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving The good intentions that you had
I just wanted to hold on
Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive I wish that we could save today
Can't you see I'm doing fine, it's what I've always wanted Two little kids out on the lawn
Beautiful haze of suburbia
And my paintings by Marilyn Manson 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
'Cause girls are such a drag Eyes are, open words are spoken
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
I know I've seen you trashed
That I stayed over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
It's not right So here's your holiday
And I can't just swallow it
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
I had to fall
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
She's an angel yeah I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
The air is so cold and numb
(I'll take the last train home)
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Yeah later, see you around (Here we go motherfuckers)
Forever and ever
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already
Young and hostile
Here comes the moonlight Can you remember, you remember the last time
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again
Tried hard not to get caught
The voices in my head are always screaming
Bent over to show some moonlight
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
We bought a one way ticket
A-a-a-antisocial
Knocked out
I've got so much left to say, I'd tell you everything
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay Don't like hesh-don't like rap
Loose on the streets of California
Again I waited for this to pull apart
To pick you up on our very first date
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
And I'll see, you when this is done
life's waiting to begin (do this with me)
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
Always sharp and cold always beautiful
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me I'll think about the times
Sixteen just held such better days
(Oh oh oh oh) so I come over and over and over
You fucked up my life I'm sick of always hearing
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
What a crazy world
I numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time
Late at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
It's been awhile
Now the dead and dying
My little windmill Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Kids are victims in this story
I feel dumb and long night coming Did you steal my prayers I don't know where I was
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
Lost the girl, left the line
Another night with her
At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
The way I feel inside is worse than poison Washed up standing on a beach
At the world around me
Well, I guess this is growing up
I know you fucked him again
And she was like a blade of ice
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home Wake me when this war is over
Again I waited for this to change instead
Life is too short to last long Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Pulled out some beer and gulped it down
Dad got nude-I wore a thong
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue green eyes
And time runs your life I talk to you every now and then
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
Please don't kick my ass
Lets start this again for real So here I am I'm trying
These are the good old days You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
The tidal wave and aftermath
Things aren't the way they were before
Insider information, hand in your resignation
I'd read it every day So here's your holiday
With a walk-on part of a background shot
I remember the look her mother gave us
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
I'm just broken
So I said I'd call her but never would bother
And think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)
So when you're dead and gone
Charge the pizza to the house
The Webs from all the spiders
What a nice creation
Something bitterly And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
The arrow missed It isn't exciting reciting the stories
There's so much more that I wanted and
You needed time to grow
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Driving you mad even if she falls in love There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
And threw herself on the floor She's a-a-a-antisocial
The universe an empty place without you I wish that we could save today
We're not the same, we're two in a million
I need some more time to fix this Here's a letter for you
You're not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone's gone missing
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because And my girlfriend likes ul and dhc
A-a-a
Pushed as far as I can go
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I will follow the trail to tomorrow
And your husband's in jail
I kinda like the little rush you get
Oh yeah
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Cover up the scars put on your gameface
hey ohhh here I am
Bored to death and fading fast
To face this on my own, well I guess this is growing up
How do we fix this if we never have vision Day in day out
Can you remember, you remember the last night
What went wrong?
To pass the time in my room alone In the car I just can't wait
These are the good old days
I'll take one lift
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) I never needed to hear
Long journeys wear me out but
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
Let's take a walk out on the pier
There's no use dwelling on the past
When friends were listening to slayer
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
About being on time
All the sad songs on the radio
I'm dying in this silence The last star left in heaven
To keep going So just take my hand
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Cuz every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home
'Cause in the end it's fuckin' useless
Take your eyes off the floor
Can't be overstated at all
It's useless, my name has made the list
We all need something to live for
Under the moonlight Can you remember, you remember the last time
When you cried
Sober I know I messed up and it might be over
And it is way too unhealthy
We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
What the hell is call ID?
She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
For real 'cause you were driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Then why is there so much pain? So here's your holiday
How she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
But I gotta wonder why you'd leave it out for me (shit!) Why am I still hanging around
With many years ahead to fall in line
And if young love is just a game then
What are you running from?
You can only lean on me for so long I remember shots without a chaser
I need a girl that I can train I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
Remember I'm a kid
I know that I was right
But let me call you when I'm sober Sober
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I wunna suck my dad, and my mom too, oh is this thing on? (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare
Take me away from here
And I'll say
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na) Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
That none of this means anything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
And the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard
Take my flatscreen television
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this Are you afraid of being alone
A short story of a lonely guy Who fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
They go out everyday she goes every way, oh yeah
I look ill but I don't care about it
Another six months I'll be unknown
And a heart of steel always on her own
Nothing to hold on to
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
That hes lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant
With you You get under my skin
Webs from all the spiders
Teenage rules they're f***ed and boring We really need to see this through
And then we'd look
I'm barely standing on the ground
It gets me so
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show The drops of rain they fall all over
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
Was I supposed to accept it
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
And now I, have come to realize
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
But not enough to hold you back It feels like the moon
I guess its just another night alone Let's get started, the faint and broken-hearted
'Cause you said this was right
I got my eye on you
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
To have a summer that they could call
To face this on your own, well I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up
I'm kind of nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
With you
Almost never real
Help me, I'm scared please show me how
Of going back to San Diego
The pain it won't end even if she falls in love
And each time walk right on by? Like violence you have me, forever, and after
I cannot live
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
Of anything anymore
I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic
Solitude's a reason to die Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
We'll wish this never ends
I hope I won't forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won't be too much longer until I'm able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I'm sick of always hearing
Mobs that rule the school and workplace
Size extra large Sip a drink of the alcohol
This time I'll get it right
She kissed me after class
Sometimes I just don't know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) Oh yeah
And got so far
Often they've typically been starved for attention before She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
These nights go on and on and on I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
Well, I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up
Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
Like violence you kill me, forever and after Push it out, fake a smile
Everything inside of my heart
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
All along we talked of forever
The start was something good
Worthless answers from friends of mine
Do you still feel the same way Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I was the one there last night You have your other friends
When you're standing close to death
They never solve them
We are the kings of the weekend It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving
Still buring Please tell me why
Well I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
Turn all the lights down now
But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
They keep me up all night Everyone's cross to bears are the crown they wear on endless holiday
Only to come back as pure as gold
What's my age again, what's my age again? What's my age again? All the small things
She said, don't let my door hit your ass Don't leave me all alone
Smoked a bong killed a cat
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
You do with your pigtails
And I'll smile and you'll wave we'll pretend it's okay
True care truth brings
Just victims left to bleed
It is a woken dream
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
To fight this, God has a master plan
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
It's not right
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) (she's out of her mind)
The show tonight. Hope you all had a great time. I know I did
She's all I dream
His issues make my mind ache
They were there
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
Here's to the sunrise
We'll never give up, it's no use
We would laugh and get high
The names she was dropping the games she was playing
Or what you threw at me Please tell me
To fill a whole, to shake the sky in two
We'd forget that our lives being apart it is hard
If this is what he wants
My car is in the front yard
And I, don't want to worry
One more time with feeling
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'm so sick of fights I hate them
Why would you wish that on me?
Often they've typically been starved for attention before Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk...
With those things on their chest
Neighbors and friends that you don't know
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
I should have kissed you in L.A.
Everything has fallen to We really need to see this through
Meet me where the skyline ends Los Angeles when will you save me
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out) What's the point of saying sorry now (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry)
It's not a change of taste
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
Twenty years now lost
Turn your back and run now
I see them everyday
Let me go in her room
You're too late
(You did this)
The season is calling and your pictures are falling down The steps that I retrace the sad look on your face
And I know he's only looking to score (he's only looking to score)
All these other assholes, can I get an oh yeah? On and on, reckless abandon
Worth another night in jail He's a player, diarrhea giver
My thoughts send me on a carousel
This room is such a lonely place without you I wish that we could save today
Please don't look at me with those eyes
(So sorry it's over)
I keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don't look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess.
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
Whoa
I screamed into a microphone
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
You're to blame Everything has fallen to pieces
Los Angeles when will you save me
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time
Even if your hope has burned with time
Just drop me off at home
Girls possess me but they're never mine
And yesterday I thought of you
Where you can always find me
But some good things must end And she said, "It could never survive
(Fate fell short this time)
And fed the dog brownie drugs
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
With such differing lives
Home is such a lonely place Home is such a lonely place I always flirt with death
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night I know I messed up and it might be over
I've put my trust in you
And like a river they flow
On the first night we met Look to the past
You can only lean on me for so long
Each of them means everything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
Home is such a lonely place I love the lightning but hate the rain
I can't remember what was said
And I am sleeping with my cloths on
It was mine
She said goodbye and left again
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can't forgive
I'm never coming home [Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
I'm just scared of what you think
Should we try this before we give up and move on
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Took a shower cause I stunk
I stop to think at a wishing well
Here's a form, go wait in line
You always play to win
With green eyes and long blond hair
And both playing in punk rock bands
Wish I could slow down time
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading La da da da, da da da da
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
We would drink on the train
Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight
We never wanted to be abused
We lost the war
We'll wish this never ends (I miss you I miss you)
I don't need anyone There's an echo pulling out the meaning
I watched the fire burn the sea
Here we go
Do you like my stupid hair?
And I'm still more amused by TV shows
I know not a reason why
To save me
I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
I'll let you know
Put blankets on the bed
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
Lost the words, lost the nerve,
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
He fucked a chick in the parking lot On and on, reckless abandon
That I will pick you up
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
Where everyone was working for this goal
Cause I am, I'm lost without you Are you afraid of being alone
(The last train home) [Bridge: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
That you are, the one who's left behind Please stay, until I'm gone
Pretty little girl In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
Late at night on mercy street
With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Don't meet expectations
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Those Blink fellas sure put on a kick ass show, huh. Hope to see
I need somebody and always
They can't trust me because I blew it once before (Alright) Nothing to lose
Were taking this way too slow
To pass the time in my room alone I never thought I'd die alone
I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time
Talk some shit take it back
Life is too short to last long There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
I fucked your mom
Life's waiting to begin. With all of this I know now
With green eyes and long blonde hair
I trace the cord back to the wall
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside And she dragged me to the edge of town
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?" We are forgotten young suburbia
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Days when I can still feel alive
We know where we go
I barely made it out alive
I said, "don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
Your secrets filled up my ears
When you know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
She might be the one maybe we'd have some fun
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I never want to act my age
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Not that I'm poor, just to fine
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass." One more chance, I'll try this time
Here I am standing on my own
Kinda like a bullet
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again
Always (Get ready for action!)
What stupid poem could fix this home
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
Black sedan ran a red light
I kinda think that we won't get better
Catching things and eating their insides
We go where we know She's all I need
Spending all night getting lost together I know I messed up and it might be over
Where did I go wrong?
Don't waste your time on me you're already
On the go and it's way too late to play
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
I get too scared to move cause I'm still
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
But my chance is gone I know just where I stand, a boy
This house is haunted
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now) Dear head, shut up
I'm never coming home
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
Even if she falls in love
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
I'm ripe with things to say
We started making out and she took off my pants
Money is so much less
I'm empty as a movie set, it's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California
I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)
Where's my dog?
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
We'll waste the best nights of our life
You ran me over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
Whatcha gonna do Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Size extra large It'd be nice
Lay still while you fall asleep
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time
The shadow in the background of the morgue
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued She said
Size extra large Break a window and bust a wall
Spending time inside together
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
As well my feelings do
My dad used to give me all of his advice
I'm the first to know
I know, I can't live without it oh no I think I'm on another world with you
Use me Holly come on and use me
A memory that's full of fun
You left me on the day after Christmas
And if I ever got another chance
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
Can't forget
I'm surprised it got so (far)
(I miss you, miss you) (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare
I'm right here, waiting
She's all I'm always wanting
Choke my voice Say goodnight
As if I had a choice, anyway Where are you coming from?
I don't need anyone
I'll leave when I wanna I said settle down, settle down everything is fine
Like every single tree reach for the sky
(I'm feeling this) Show me the bedroom floor
Always
Let's make this last forever When you smile, I melt inside
Turn the lights off, carry me home
You let me down now
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh life is too short to last long)
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb
But then I turned on the TV And that's about the time she walked away from me
And you are getting rides home in his car
The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)
And pretend to restore what we have and hold on
With the radio on and a new black eye Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
Gone It's no suprise to me I am my own worst enemy
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
There's so much more that I needed and
Fuck it it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)
They don't even care at all She's open waiting for more (she's open for more)
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
We're not growing up Save yourself where I was saving
There's just so much to do
Well, I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
Then you showed up and it began to heal 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
(Place your hand in mine)
If you play the part then I will play mine
Soon we'll all be gone Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around
You make me regret
Watching, waiting, commiserating Say it ain't so, I will not go
Our favorite movie, our favorite show
We woke up sober?
In my bed back at home watching TV alone
A I wait for your call
Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
And you've been there for too long
The summer air is way too sweet
I need some more time to fix this problem
I can't sleep here no more
I won't turn out the light, just
(I had sex with your mother) night alone Now as I walk down the street
To lead you on I learned a lot today
Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue Tonic and a fifth of gin
I came in throught the window... Last night
I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see
They can't trust me because I blew it once before Beige little boxes in a row
Your breath in this cool room chill
Back on earth, I'm broken
I felt this thing
But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Like when you're driving me crazy Hold on as we crash into the earth
I must have missed the kick off
I need something
Forget when I
Place your hand in mine
Naked at night
Life is too short to last long (Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh)
Fall into the unknown Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land
Always I know
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
I love all the things you do
We are the kings of the weekend I can feel my head falling off my neck
One thing / I don't know why
I need a girl that I can train Need a girl that I can train
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And I can't explain what I need
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Fell onto the table as the neighbors just stared
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I'm barely standing on the ground (Barely standing on the ground)
'Cause you're the only thing I feel 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
Work sucks, I know
It all just seems to be how
But I know I'll never be that cool I never wanted to hold you back
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Once we had love, now it's gone
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Someone that understands and sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
What's my age again, what's my age again? That's about the time she broke up with me
Heart is broken, love unspoken
I'm always wanting you
With the girl at the rock show (I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
'Cause I love your little motions
Cause you said this was right
Now in prison for one month no one to see
And never answer the phone I cant forgive
Hearing the latest news
These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place And I know that everything's gonna be fine Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk...
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
Like you never did pull out that weapon
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole) Oh, oh
Hold me up, underneath
I don't find it irritating
Can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge
To fall in love or break it off
These are the good old days You're giving up
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
I said I was the cops
The cigarette and gasoline I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Not a motion from the telephone
We can't depend on your excuses
Where are you and I'm so sorry
Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end At times like these
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
You all at the after show party. I'm gonna start sucking dicks
(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Where all the children left without a trace
(this can't be the end)
Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
When I'm broken There's a halo in the distance
Everything inside of my head
And you still act like you're in freshman year
We all need something to live for It's hard to wake up
Want to make a deal Ease away the problems and the pain
It's not right I can't get my feet up off the edge
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
An oversensitive guy
I'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again after you came and went
La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh) I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
We started alone in the end we're okay You said
Leave your side But what do I get
We'll fall apart on the weekend
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
What went wrong? Im kicking out fiercely
I couldn't wait till I got home
This room is bored of rehearsal
And I'll teach myself to live
Trapped in the body of a man and I'll take what you're willing to give
And I've been here for too long
Someone that understands
I know not what I did
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
I wish that the clock would often just be stopped
No noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
It would be nice
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
In the dark awake and you're not around
Even if she falls in love and it isn't so bad it's
And I know he's only looking to score
With those things on their chests
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
And your hands they shake with goodbyes
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
What the hell is wrong with me?
Pull me under
Let's make this last forever
Up through the clouds then back here
We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
But the words get confused
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
Corporate leaders, politicians
Thrown in a police car and the door slammed
Avert disaster just in time
It doesn't even matter I saw you again
My pride is more than all that I own
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Kissed every girl in class
With a good reason, a warning sign
I can take care of myself. Remember the days
But in the end
Felt a twelve gauge next to my shit
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
This is gonna shock them
It's late, so shut up
(Oh oh oh oh) but all my friends are daring me to come over
Cant forget, cant give in
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place And I know that everything's gonna be fine Yeah my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
I would wish upon a star
And you reached for my hand I was scared in your room
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together, and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately.
Let's make this last forever I've been here before a few times
You haven't got a chance now Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Everything's better when she's around
And don't forget
And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
I came inthrough the windo last night It's no suprise to me
One drink and the pain goes down
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
The darkest words you said
And she slapped me then she pulled me down
On my lap, and talk about unicorns and flowers and things like that
Often they've typically been starved for attention before She's open waiting for more
Misery loves company
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah oh oh oh) What's the point of saying sorry now
On the street with a cigarette
And time runs your life
Hey kids, it's Satan. Thanks a lot for coming on down to
In the end we all blamed you
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
I think I'm fallin' asleep
As I wait for your call
Apologize for the past
(Oh oh oh oh) so let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think
'Cause I just seem to lose
Na, na na, na na, na na)
Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
The grocery store, now's my time
At least one time Can I blame it
Like violence you kill me Like violence you have me, forever, and after
One home, one out on tour again We may never come back
Show me the bathroom mirror
Fuck the guy who took and ran away He's a player, diarrhea giver
All of the pain and the fear
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
The world was wide, too late to try
That he's lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Living in the perfect weather
She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
The strike of a match
Do you want to come to a party
The glow inside burns light upon her
She's all I'm always wanting you And all again I wait for this
Is spinning off into outer space without you
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)
Pick me up now, I need you so bad
Remembering all the times you fought with me
So we could go see the Cure
I'm here, hold on, to me
In the end
(I miss you, miss you)
They keep me up all night
(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
But it all comes back to me
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's
All day it is there to remind
The smoke alarm is going offf and there a cigarette
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I lost my head on the door She's a-a-a-antisocial
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
To explain in due time
As the world falls apart
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
(I miss you miss you) It's alright to tell me what you think about me
To lead you on
For a hobby I make bombs Went to a farm to tip some cows
Your smile fades in the summer
It's the longest start, but the end is not too far away
Watch it count down to the end of the day
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) All the small things
Im kicking out fiercely
(So lost and disillusioned) I know I messed up and it might be over
Just as the four walls close me within
(And after, and after, and after) Like violence you have me, forever, and after
This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun
Sink like stones
And my mama too
but if you're worried,
Life is too short to last long
With you, with you, with you, with you again This bed, on fire
All I hear are the many echoes of
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Like I'm the one full of regret
Don't wait
To have a blow job
Keeping our reputations clean
(I'll leave when I wanna) Fate fell short this time
It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
This sick strange darkness
(Your smile fades in the summer)
When friends were listening to Slayer
Are we cursed to this life Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
Our breathing has got too loud
The night will go on, my little windmill Say it ain't so, I will not go
One hours waste of time
Time won't change
hey yo here I am
Everything has fallen to pieces
Do you still feel the same way
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh)
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
The charade it won't last when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again
life's waiting to begin
When my heart, it explodes I cant forgive
Stand up straight and tall and shout about it I think I'm on another world with you
Soft shadows lay by her feet
So read my book, with a boring ending
Life's waiting to begin
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic La da da da, da da da da
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose
I'm on another planet with you
(Oh oh oh oh) that I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
I'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
She's all I'm always wanting you
Buying food every once in a while
There's no use trying
'Cause you're the only thing I feel Someday
Show me the way you move
And squeezin' titties, maybe I can put my peepee in your mouth
Anything that is dead shall be re-grown
Please tell me why
With a cigarette on the first night we met Look to the past and remember her smile
Still pushing that chance to try
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
Is it so hard to see? And if you're feeling scared
You haven't got a chance now Need a girl that I can train
To anyone standing alone on the street
I'll shower you with lies
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy She makes me feel like it's raining outside
It makes no sense at all
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) Crossed the street
Will you remember this night
She left me roses by the stairs
If we're f***ed up
Na, na na, na na, na na
I'm sick with apprehension
Tight lipped procrastination
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
Even though, as they all know you weren't the only one, two, three, four Why do you still keep it around
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are You said
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Just having fun You couldn't wait for something new
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
In its plague and I can never escape
We get along, so why can't they?
I am my own worst enemy
Hey, here's to you California Cut the skin to the bone
(Na, na na, na na, na na
Too high, got vertigo He took a shit in the bathroom tub
But I'm always wanting you Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can't find you
And although she saw the mark
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show With the girl at the rock show
And never answer the phone I can't forgive
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there
He's a fucking weasel
Touch you feel you
When I see you after class, you're hating everything Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
I can't replace
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
The night will go on
This time I don't want to
They keep me up all night I talk to you every now and then
But not enough to slow you down I feel like the moon
Fall asleep all alone
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
In spite of the way you were mocking me
And I am sleeping with my clothes on
The state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
You fucked up my life I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me
I never wanted to know
Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
We couldn't wait to get outside
Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
Fuck it it's such a blur
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Even if she falls in love Try to look in her eyes the light is just right
And I'll come, back soon just like you would
Well, I guess this is growing up I never thought I'd die alone
When the shades have been pulled shut
We'll be here to try it again Im sick of always hearing
I made my entrance
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight
What went wrong? Im kicking Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
Tried to grow his hair out
And stick that knife in my back
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. I fucked your mom
Gone Please tell me why
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass." Let's try this one more time with feeling
Nothing to do
The apart and departed look in my eyes Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land
Na na na na na na
Anxiety's calling in my head Is it back again?
And sick of the boundaries
It's so unreal
She said no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright
Unless you do this with me hey yo, here I am (do this with me)
I really wish it was only me and you
On our way to the show, Chicago
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Day in day out
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
With the way that they dress
Won't forget you
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
With you, with you, with you, with you again I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down, I won't fall down)
Meet me where the skyline ends
Lose myself in your eyes
I think you used me again
But I won't need rehabilitating, oh no I think I'm on another world with you
Grab a knife, erase my vision
It's too late
But I drove home all alone
From a movie I'm not in She's so important
hey ohhh, here I am (do this with me)
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I hope I won't forget you My head is made up of memories
The farmer took me to his house
She's all I need
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again
I love it when the kids come on over and I get, I have them suck
From your mom My Dearest,
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
We might have had it all
Sappy love songs on the radio
I feel numb and all or nothing
You speak and make time stand still
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
They don't even care at all She's open waiting for more
Checked my engine I fell behind I fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
Only seconds left
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Say it ain't so, I will not go
She always kept me waiting
How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
The tour is over, I've survived
so hard
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And your... Gone
(Are we alone do you feel it)
Now only came to this
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful I haven't been this scared in a long time
Pretty little girl And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
And break the truth
She kills with no life to spare
Maybe I'll even suck their blood. See ya kids later! Hey, how you guys doin' up in the back? Now from the top balcony
Wasted it all just to
Tomorrow's frightening but not today
And it's driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
My broken heart was in a cast
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
Surprises let me know she cares Say it ain't so, I will not go
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Another girl, another planet
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
Didn't look out below
And I'll be fine Remember the days
What went wrong I'm kicking Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
Show up right on time
Nude in a gutter is how I was found
Na, na, na, na
I waited for her call
I feel alone and tired
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
They can't trust me because I blew it once before Shit, dad
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
I'm too depressed to go on
We are the kings of the weekend This is the first (thing I remember)
With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss Please stay, until I'm gone
You'll be at my show
And the things they suggest to me I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
How deep these cuts on you go
You'll never step foot in my room again
Something's wrong
But then all that it means is
We all need something to live for She said I let her down, let her down I no longer dream
And I'm so retarded And now I realize
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
My friends say I should act my age
Into the time
To pass the time in my room alone I never conquered, when you came
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
Always I've been here before a few times
Acting like I was part of your property
The clock ticks life away
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
I need a drink, cause in a while
I never felt so alone again
Honest, let's make
Another girl, another planet Space travel's in my blood
I didn't mean to call you that
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
I need some more time to fix this I'm talking to the ceiling
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
Like violence you kill me,
I'd ask if you feel the same
The candle's burning at both ends." And now she knows too much
Need a girl that I can train
(All or nothing) It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Is one night too much to ask for You are a haunted house
On one of my dumb friends
For all this
You're superstitious
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy Remember when I was in
Rather than fix the problems
You ground me all the time
Time keeps moving on and on and on
You'll come back to me
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)
Home is such a lonely place We're falling faster than we can fly
I can face your threats and
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Are you back again? Don't wake me up before you leave
Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth In Los Angeles, when will you save me
I can't listen no more
And playing those games
Unless you do this with me
With you Another girl, who's loving you now
(So lost and disillusioned)
To face this on my own
Hey, here's to you California Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Drown our youth with useless warnings
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh) Josie, you're my
I'm superstitious
Forgot that I left my pants down
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Is my picture still hanging in her locker? I haven't been this scared in a long time
I said, don't let your future be destroyed by my past.
Jobs and social groups
Some girls try too hard to impress
So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
So I gotta give it away
And as I stared I counted
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Earth is dying help me Jesus
Too late and tired
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there
I guess its just another
Everybody would waste it all
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) Naa, na na na na na naaaa
The world is wide, the time goes by
She took my hand and that made it I swear Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
I can't breathe
I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
Some girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream again
I was the one there last night When I needed you most
The pain won't end even if she falls in love
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
There ain't nothing I can do about it
That I will be right here, waiting [Repeat: x3] We're falling faster than we can fly
I miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I
Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh) Hey, here's to you California
Like indecision to call you
It all just goes to show how
Because she kept me waiting I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
We would stay up all through the night
I would like to find him Friday night
And she put up with my friends
Don't wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing?
If you're gonna to fall
Of apple juice in the hall
No one should take themselves so seriously
Anything but I'd go through hell for you and I haven't been this scared in a long time
I climbed through your window at 3am
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
A target that I'm probably gonna miss Let's go
And she's so smart and independent
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
Down down down down
She's the one, she'll always be there
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh yeah
While I'm drowning in the next room
I hate you all, your mom's a whore
Another planet Please, mom
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
But now just as things change
And I want to suck my dad
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
I came in throught the windo last night
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Want to make a deal
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
I dont think she needs me
You'll be sorry when I'm gone I never conquered, rarely came
Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
You make me nervous so I really can't eat Let's go
Tonight
You'll come back to me maybe
And kiss my peepee tenderly and gently. I like it when the kids sit
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all you make me want to scream
But let me call you when I'm sober
I can't believe my eyes, are you for real? My life before was such a mess
We fell on the floor and we started to move
Life's so strange
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
After you came and went
Smiling from ear to ear
Please tell mom this is not her fault I never conquered, when you came
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show Black and white picture of her on my wall
Is falling down to earth and
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And she said, (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
We've been misled
To lose it all
Na na na na na na I woke up in the pouring rain
And I guess you, you really got me now
It doesn't even matter
I left hungover?
When I can't wait to get outside
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
You will be fine hey yo here I am
You fucked up my life Im sick of always hearing
Los Angeles I'm never coming home
Like I let you down then So sorry, it's over
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
You know that it meant everything to me You know that it meant everything to me I think of awhile ago
With more bad news
We need guidance
In time things rearrange
And here we go
I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
It's not right Their anger hurts my ears
And I guess, I am in his demand Please save me, this time I cannot run
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
Like violence you kill me, forever, and after Can't count all the eyes that stare
I'll turn to a friend
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land La da da da, da da da da
Cuz every now and then I kick the livin' shit out of me Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk
Another planet, who's holding you down
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) I'm so lost
La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
Well, I guess this is growing up Everything has fallen to pieces
Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge
Hear your voice in the dark
Most of them useless delusions
Days when I still felt alive
I read the sadness on your face I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
My life just lost all meaning
This place, its fucking cursed
All along, you wish that she would stay
Like I never did good for us both
My thoughts send me on a carousel Here I am standing on my own
But that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this)
I didn't mean to call you that I, I can't get you more pregnant
Of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And I'll do it again
Bent over to pick them up
I can breathe for a while
Should I go back should I go back should I
Hold it up, I've got something I cannot hide
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
Nothing I know changes me at all
It's obvious
But I'm always looking out for you
My eyes are open up with pure sunlight
Just a stupid, worthless boy She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
What's my age again, what's my age again? And that's about the time she walked away from me
Night alone Thanks a lot you guys!
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
time is a valuable thing
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
A bit of pain will help us suffer when you're hurt
Like a lonely road clears day of life
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
What the hell is A.D.D.?
Don't forget to think about me and I
We're only halfway home
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
Long hair that blows side to side
As school life is a
By the sound of falling rain
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
