"Oh, why you talkin' like that"
How they let these rappers lie how dare I tell the truth!
Who bought these fuckin' T.V.'s and jewelry bitch, tell me that?
Ah shit She dragging a mink coat, got Peter pissed, it's a pity
She walked by asking me, "Are you Nas?"
Man I got talent too, the nigga ain't hearin me.
Straight to my Phantom, call Africa Black
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Then take a little time off and just cool it
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Are there anymore like ya
So all the kids on my block can look up and say, hey Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
It's wood in the whip the wood like a wood shop
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
Jiggle it baby, jiggle it baby It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Leather boots and a thong, Well I'll be there in a double,
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her
The way that booty propels it needs a hella pad
You got two booties so you whipping yo chin
Home of the strip club,
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
Ass so fat and the pussy like Fiji My chick bad (diamond)
It's the abominable hoe man
"Tell him to stop wearing my chain"
You work yo thing, I'll work mine
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Asian persuasion, no discrimination
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Go head baby, go head baby, jiggle it, now that do that shit
Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach
Or bustin' massive 'round some s.k.
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
We come by the masses you come and get choked
And then, trillion When all your love is lost
From the bed down to the floor, sex room
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)
"Are ya'll coming through or what?"
Startin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight
If you was ridin, you was ballin to homie Shadi
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
And I been thankin' of bustin' you
I would happen to know, the one with the flow
And 'cause my Christmas tree decorated in toilet paper But little do they know, they bout to see a show
'cause we knock 'em unconscious with that non-sense
7-0-8, 5-0-2
Baby lets hop up in the shower,
Bout the business of this shit, how to flip a few coins
My partners call me prince cause they know I got that purple rain
You lookin' mighty
Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buying us
"Ah, this the bodyguard trippin'"
School teacher let me get my grades (chorus) x4 Heads up! Heads up!
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Where the cops at? Cause I'm drunk as fuck
and fat women 'cause they need love too
i like it when you let me try anything
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
I love y'all, there's not enough time.
Is it cause they like my gangsta ways?
Just keep on pissin' me off, like a weak kidney
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around from me
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
You're not alone my friend
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
A lot of women drop it to the ground
Effervescent time
In the club chillin with G-S-U-P, but after go down it's in D.T.P.
Filling in the Gump wit no track of Tom Hanks
Her name is lil' Stacy, and they become friends
Well make it last for ever
And hos never close they open like hallways
Stand up! (just like that)
So I gotta get straight to the cash
Or cowboy and Indians,
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
But im saying use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
if it tickles in the middle from Mr Pickles, you try to escape
Eh it's still all good
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
So let's go (let's go) let's go (let's go) for the beat
Knowin' that you got someone to talk to ain't that what you want?
Precious like a artifact, Valuable like a quarterback,
Damn, calm down, B-B-C T-X-T or M-S-G
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Welcome to Atlanta where the playas play
It's me plus one can I bring my friends
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
Better yet a customer, guaranteed to buy it
And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again [Chorus] I came to party like tonight will never end
I'm about to take off, so f what ya heard
But'chu you won't wrap up ya bandages, or hell you would Nigga I got shotty's and semi's, I love 'dro and henne' ?
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
I'll catch you at a show and beat you with a mixtape
Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
Got a nigga so weak and I get no sleep
You gotta do it right, what? (fuck, me!) You bout to buy a ring, she needs the finer things
If you want it, come get it
Pull out the roach, roll up the dough, money I'ma throw again holla at my folk
Valor dick whorian and all man
Some broads got an
I cant loose with 22"s, Bitch thats whats up
With perpendicular vehicular homicide
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone,
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I gotta make a nigga stop, drop, roll, oh no where the beat go?
It's Ludacris, I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines
Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed
Find me on tha block tryin' to cop a piece of the crop
But they don't understand
I wanna li li li lick you from your head to your toes
I've been lookin' for a woman just to put my stamp on
My baby's in dire need
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Me and my homies, so drop that
Always a must, stay "Adrenaline Rush"
Off the off ramp doin' about a hundred and fifty
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0
So if you coming out the pocket then you might get laid
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
Ya want to, but I really want you
My chick bad
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,
Cause you don't fuck us niggas we fuck you [Chorus] (Hey ho)
Off, you feel the pump like it's sawed off
You know I got a
I put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Yo, one of my ways of releasing tension while I'm releasing some steam
Put nozzles, nozzles, right over your leg, niggas
Ho! (But can I get a ride?)
Why did you take him away? (Hey) I need some money please (please)
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin' slapped up I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
We just do it like you do, see the roles done switched
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off
Lubricated silencers
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
I want to (Diamond in the back)
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
I got games galore, I got game for sure
Shot gun, hold tight, don't fall off
I'm feelin' so sexy
Real niggas is always what I stood for
I like it when you let me try, anythang
Grenades, outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest, in Mardigra all the women tryna show mw
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
After sixty seconds tell that trick to put her pants on
And my teachers a cougar so I wish she'd lend a helping hand, a helping hand
Said you can tell me what you like to do,
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
It's hoes up in the lobby, it's hoes out on the stroll
What's that? "Totally with it, T.W.I."
But in the mean-time, in between time
Purchase a nasty flick, wrap up and tie her quick
S-M-H it's such a shame
I wanna ah ah you make it so good I don't wanna leave
Know how to mack a broad, she's on your sack and balls
Gut slappin' ball slappin' cater
So by tomorrow you forgot what you was sayin' today
S-M-H it's such a shame that you ain't learned a damn thing So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
How you wanna ride just let me know
If you want this cash, gotta make that ass shake like a seizure
But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
Don't know what you got, but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame.
I rip meanface niggas one by one
When I move you move (just like that)
That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But I cried the first time I had to go to the dentist
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I love women so I'm in it to win it
With the candles lit you give it up till they go out
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo' bitch as the bait
Every freckle spot, every speck, I say, I say
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
cause you looking to long
Other rappers wanna be my friend, I'm too rich to fuck with youuuuuu! I'm drunk (I'm drunk)
Baby your girl and my friend can trade
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
Why? "If you was I'd be totally TWI"
I used to run numbers in line they called me bingo
Whole lotta game, whole lotta keys and burners
Get up in the house and my nose is redder than Rudolph's I think I need some help with the buckle on my belt
Grab the pills cause we popping tonight,
The competition never just want to admit that they lost
While he doin' shows, I'm in these streets, know what I'm sayin'?
But I ain't care, cause this game has started to open it's arms
If you toting good, then all the smokers, let me see ya flame.
I'm on the right page but what's my format
How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?
Can't nobody do it quite like I do
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown
It seems as if that's what I need
Or some cheese if ya need it ,
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I got a couple black belts, but they all from Louie Louie,
Bells are ringing, children si
That would be inappropriate
And comin' to get cha' I'm all alone in my room,
Pimpin pimpin pimpin,
Stay chromed out
Its about to get real x-rated
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
'Cause everyday's her get this D day
Because now you gots to ride out, bitch Oh 'Cris, can you do it again, that's what they askin' me
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers [Chorus] [Ludacris]
Take my pain away (please)
The top of yo booty jigglin' out yo'jeans
They chest, Heyy
I love the chicks that got a lotta ass, so we love that c-c-c-c Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons So wash all ya sins away and stop playin'
And 4-0-4, I'm worldwide bitch, act like y'all don't know
Ain't no need of even asking Brah,
She could go lower than I ever really thought she could,
First met Quincy Jones, he said I looked like Snoop
Cause You're my baby girl Ludacris
I want to (Sunroof top)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire). Got a lil' bit of blueberry yum yum, and I never would of thought that it could taste this good,
So three years went past, and I saved enough cash
That's what I said about my bust my first nuts
And you can tell she's a figure five, so we love that c-c-c-c Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
And full of class when you a step
Pimp em like Bishop, magic Don Juan
I done killed so many niggaz in the booth I sell rappers on ebay,
Then it's more she gets, if it's more she wants
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Only time I go half, is half on a half
Cause we about to slip and slide
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
Good God almighty
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, nigga what?
I be representin' I be representin' (I'm representin')
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Now hurry up and make it to me,
I put my balls on the table, tell her rack em up
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Its a ho wide world, that we living in
Make a student be late for the class
You say the only family u got is in the game
Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that, so back that
Just show me how to dance (OOOH)
And the only way to make is by sell cocain
Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin, if you are dancin on the dancefloor and you look to
See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself
I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos
Cause you know that most you ladies trading sex for money
Some motherfuckin' trouble Ooh what you gonna do? Sweat you out til' you thirsty,
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
And the people just stare so I love to park it
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
OK, OK, OK hey
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
Style so sexy, make her just right
Might as well shake what ya mama gave ya
Whoo! We in the Red Light District!
But our time and our clothes gotta coordinate
I'm flexin, ain't that a bitch! (ain't that a bitch!) Bitches be cryin fo me they want my autograph
Stand up! Stand up! Damn right the Fire Marshall wanna shut us down
Oh! Oh! Oh! Say it (make love to me)
Cats cringe and point like pssh
I bet you look even better with me in between
Handlin' business while I bang bang, skeet
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screaming, "Gimme a break!"
I flash 'em and out last 'em
But after dumpin a round you'll be wonderin' where the cops at
Dollar and a dream and I made what I could
Where you at?

Blow! We ain't got nothing to worry about
Welcome to my sex room
Cause I'm in it to win it and I really don't want to
You gotta make it last, what? (fuck, me!)
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
Ive got a sausage for them hot cakes
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
Oh Yet and still you wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil,
I can't get the name of this duty
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
So I picked up a couple books by Donald Goins
Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pulling on my coat tail
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
And all you fagot-muthafuckas gotta know the routine [Chorus: x4] Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors
How 'bout in the library on top of books

Fatties wearin' my shit

Dirty South girls gimme Dirty South head
Type of rat, sat on my ass
I find gold links and snatch 'em like I'm Deebo
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life,
No matter what we went through
I was fifteen years old and in high school
Ballas break bread
No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I split ya spleen, as matter' fact I split ya team
Get ya cake up, get ya weight up way up to the top 'til u can't go further
You've been looking so good all day
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the bath tub

I'm doin' a hundred on the highway
So tell me where you are I'm all alone in my room,

Where they kick it at? And a lot of people just don't know
Father, father, and hey I love gold
Light showers and you're probably hookin' up with that girl
(In my sex room)
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
I'ma 'bout to punch yo, lights out
2 fast, 2 furious
My mind and body are gone
You both unite as one, you the moon and she's your sun
I send three-six ol' shit, nigga what?
Why she's all alone, and they never met her family
Give it to me now, give it to me now Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I've got you tangled up and you caught all in my web
Should I wild out, what the fuck?
Wonderin' why they don't be bustin' the same I'm clutchin' my thang
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach,
Can you send a nasty pic
Watch how I put it down When all your love is lost
Into my cave for the night I'll be your favorite delight,
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shining
Like Micheal when he won his first championship ring
The way you put it down in between the sheets is like no other girl
To everybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
Cause I've thought out every step
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks
There's somethin' wrong, we can't stay still
And I'm a loving intellect
You can't compare it, don't stare, 'cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane. Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now Check it
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
If I call in, I might stay in it
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
And yeah, we blow trees and beez, that's fantastic
Took you long enough
Stopping that pussy dropping gone Head down, pussy pussy popping
How to do it deep voice deep voice" "What up"
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em Now I got the feelin' we can cut the hell out each other
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Bridge: Miguel]
She banging it, trap star she sanging it
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
I put my fist up, I got the power girl
Back to the mackin' and jackin' the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
can it be, Sheila E, Appalonia, vanity all mad at me
Or red carpet dick and just roll out
So go girl, go get it, go girl, go kill it
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Bitch, your whole town's on my nutsacks
And when I'm drunk tell them kids, "Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?" Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
And I'm needin' you to stretch me,
Tell me what I'm gon' do? act a fool I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode
you can hope for the best, but expect the worst
Is it cause they like my gangsta talk?
My my chick bad, badder than yours
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em Cut up, gettin brains, in the Range
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
You do it standing up, orgasms hand 'em up
She call me for special ops, I told her that's my Call of Duty She be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
I'm 'bout to find me a woman that skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet,
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
"Man fuck all that ya'll coming through?"
Thighs to the cheek
the pieces from the east is the shit and the flesh in the west is the best
So play the check book tell me how do you bounce that
When I was three I was just a little G
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Cause I give her what them girls like [Chorus] [Bridge] [Verse 1: Ludacris]
Like pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
I'm talk bout the Westside, westside nigga what?
New Era on ya brain like a A-Town Fitted,
Jiggle it baby, jiggle it baby She jingalin', she too legit
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 1: Ludacris]
All I need is a bitch right now, to blow me away then take me down
The first time I stole was a sky box, basketball cards, and a candy bar
Bust through his vest, bust through his chest
Oh a sauna, ja'causezi
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body, please say put yo hands down, if yo spinnin rims
And keep on tickin' from thicker thighs
More nuts on your face
Cuz what I did I told my mom I'd never do it again
An here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health
Always yappin' about this and that
Lets fly away and go somewhere where its 81 degrees
What you see I keep it pumpin yeah I got that hard back,
And I was krunk, all the big wigs was hearing my songs
She had a ballplayer dude but she f-cked him up
while you stuck up in yo cubicle
And I'm goin' so deep
Ludacris in the back of your Chevrolet
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Who did it?, it was me I suppose
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
Knockin' boots all night long, we not stoppin'
She a stallion, no horseshit
Waitress said another round? I said you already know You see I started from nothing and made it up outta the hood
You know the phrase, scared money don't make none! [Chorus] [Ludacris]
But you can talk me through it
"I could of swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
Get pinned, by me and my family
These women tryin' yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
Ain't nothing like the first time (I gotta have your ass home)
My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene
Ain't nobody else allowed in the sex room
And I had to tall Willy every look stand out
The bitches want me to fuck, true true
Me and my blueberries together and everything's, alright. Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
So I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Nipples hard as rocks, lips as soft as cotton
Matter of fact, just shave when ya get to Georgia nigga. What the fuck's up? DTP in this muthafucka!
Who them girls you be with when you be riding through?
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Its a private after party
'For I call my substitute freak I've got hoes
Get you wet as Niagara Falls,
And parties dont stop til' eight in the mornin' "Damn man, I can't believe them hoes ain't come over here man"
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
I'm so bad and I rep that hood
Now gimme the phone and let me show you
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Beginnings when I rap wit no fans, now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Heyy
So move bitch, get out the way hoe
One kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,
Y'all just don't give a fuck, what? (fuck, me!) I'm bout to throw some game, they both one and the same
Places where you'll never imagine, but Ima start at home, when I see a girl I like I walk straight up to her
Na, na, na
You take a pick, while I'm rubbing the hips,
To know ya, can you gimme ya name, if you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, Heyy
And the flesh in the West is the best
Tell me a secret
Nigga rollin' up the moe, as long that white shit up they nose
You can push me and just pull me
Yo, this is 20/20, hey, hey, Cris, Cris
Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades,
And if you don't know, now you know, Doug E. Fresh Na, na, na
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar, you know who we are, cause we pimpin all over the world,
Love Yeah, I can only imagine
And the same go for you, we a match made in heaven, Ima stand right by you
Who'd ever thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
You hear a pimp talk
Thugged out niggas wear thugged out, chains
You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
And if he don't let me borrow nothing, but ask me what I want
remembering the memories (I remember, I remember)
Electric stove so give me the keys to the Range
I'm still pumping 10 kickers, still gripping the grain
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
If men sleep around we some players but for women
Yeah, I'ma make it worth the wait though
This is Faizon Love, and uh, i love hoes. i just don't pay em Cut up, know we like to get that cut up
And I stop at a light, pull off so slow
Yeah, this how
Sleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed
People in the way want to baller block
You ain't learned a damn thing So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
When she walk by
I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
"Second chance, second chance
Promise that she gon' play her part
Thugged out blocks playing thugged out, games
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Nigga's earring, Luda throw some grapes on these bitches! These bitches throwing rose petals at my feet man!
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
It involves that local corner store
Fatty girl, fatty girl
Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes,
Nothin' but hatin' and a look of disgust
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
Broads I seem to rack up
Tell me what it is I gotcha babe
Then jump up on a yacht and sail the 7 seas
Candy yams and chitlings,
Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that
know we like to get that cut up, freaky thangs, we be bout
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
Gotta hit 'em with a reload, I gotta put 'em with the people
Take it to the floor
Say whatcha gon' do? act a fool
I'm a grant your every wish and fulfill your fantasy
Fly away [Gucci mane]
You can scratch my back and rule me
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
Runnin in the back the fuck, runnin better than aquaduct
while i bang bang, skeet
Let it kiss the sky and then make it drop
(Hell yeah, Hey DJ bring that back!)
Now some of em wanna family, a sense of security,
How ever you want it
Nah, man I don't have it dog
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me
Oh hell no" Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! I got my twin glock .40s, cocked back
Oh
You can keep your rules and regulations man cause we don't abide
Sleepy hollows laid the nigga to rest, uh Fuck That!
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Whip cream with cherries, n strawberries on top
Don't you see we in the club?! Man shut the fuck up!! Yeek yeek woop woop! why you all in my ear?!
"Nigga, I'mma whup your mutherfucking ass, nigga"
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!

Had to change my number so I went and got a new phone and new tattoo
I hear he's making that list, checking the thing twice
All up on the Snapchat
I love how they seem to please us,
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I want to (Diamond in the back)
Reach up in the sky for the ho-zone layer
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby Whoa whoa whoa
Slappin' a nigga today
So I could wake up to a very Merry Christmas Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
I'm still breaking 'em, and dice still shaking 'em
System on blast, cops just pass
Y'all just don't get it, a crib with no tenets
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body,
(Westside, westside nigga what?)
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
Hanging with women that's loving them drugs
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
And parties dont stop til' eight in the mornin' Now the party dont start 'til I walk in
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
Get the fuck back! Fuck That!
But you dont play netendo games
My money coming in
Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls
Welcome home Murray Yo, this is in thought
Motherfuckers I'm so tired of y'all niggas always talking
That you sucking down chocolate like daddy-o's
While I'm laid back chilling in my be-boy stance
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
Time to roll out the red carpet on y'all bitch asses.
See this the type shit get you
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Hoes I gotta view, but I'm stingy with the dough I'm like no not for you,
I wont stop until Im rich as them white-boy come
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little bootie up with my belt
Tell me a secret baby.
That's a rock, got you pissy and you dizzy, wanna hit me
Sex on the beach
You sleepin' I laugh, ask 'cris, I'm off the rip
They put me in a ward, I'mma have to maintain
I'm a tell you one time, don't fuck with me!
I know it's been a lil' while since I been out the house!
But obey the block rules
So much money, you can't stop that Get out my business, my business
More froze than bad ice, with a place to be
Tell Santa Claus to bring a ten million dollar check So I could spread a lil' cheer, fly a couple leers
Tryin' to get my baby child support soon
I'm hurtin' the game so bad they can't keep up when I count this skrilla
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up
And think about it just as soon as the door close.
Cry me a river, cry me, cry me, oh
So ask 'em if they comin' ova, Oh, okay Yea, yea, so what's up, man? So what's up?
I let my "Soul Glow" from my afro, dick
Catch a sneak eak at death if ur not on ur p's & q's
"Man, I don't know, who all live there?"
That's how you like it ha,
Northside, northside nigga what?
When you get off work daddy gon' punish
Thank you, king shit Yeah motherfuckers! Welcome to the United States of America.
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
With a ass like that you gotta blow,
I had this hoe who talked too much, I had to off the bitch
Three things you can't take away from me, money, power and respect
Drunk off the liquor getting hit by, bars
You gotta do it right, what? (fuck, me!) You wanna tell the world, cause she's your favorite girl
Yet and still you would'nt believe your eyes if you went to Brazil, ain't no need of even askin
What in the world is in that BAG, what you got in that BAG?
So please pay attention when you're coming around
Round four years old and young Luda's a menace (yep)
Aw yeah, yeah
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
Kick back and just chill like a player would do
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys ans girls
We kick down doors
(Ho, now count that)
(Uh, Trackmasters
Hos are your friends, hoes are your enemies
We rock jewels
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back Runaway love
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
So come on now and get up to it y'all The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows
Nah nah, nigga Valle-hoe Oh Ohio-hoe thats what you talking about
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
It's only you and me [Chorus] Listenin' to what your body say
It ain't surprising
We don't die, we multiply
Ummph you can see that
Infamous, I'm a value meal, I come with the coke
Jingalin', jingalin', jingalin', go head, she jingalin' Go head baby, go head baby, do that shit, now jiggle
Stuffin' in it, strokin' it down, beat the stuff up
Eager as a beaver,
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind,
Goodness gracious
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
10 degrees Fahrenheit, freezing as the wind blow
Side linin' my fuckin' business
Stains they don't get off
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace
Then fly t Illinois to get a taste of Chicago,
When I was broke all love from my folks
Put it on reverse just to rack it up,
Stinkin' like a dead body up in the woods,
And I shot quick like that fool that shot Kennedy
And I was still making demo's, perfecting the craft
Thursday, jump clean, and I fall up in cream
Now nigga! [Chorus:Repeat x7] I know everybody remember their first time
I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,
It wasn't working at first then I started tweaking
Pimpin's in 3-D, I'm takin you places you only see on T.V., tryna show ya that livin is trife,
No no I think I lost that Oh no, cmon man Im trying to cut her man
And we ride on them things like every day
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jet
Yeah I think you a superstar
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
So if you could jus' shake it a little this way
There's just one thing that I gotta know How low can you go? How low can you go?
Any stank puss' make my long john, pause
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
They can't hang
And it's important that you make it understood I'm a lyricist to the death so I got what ya need, Ludacris,
Cause when I get you in my arms,
Let's say you won't know what hit cha',
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash
Still Ludacris but alias was Cris Luva Luva
With ho tendencies
And, she's damn fine, feet Hammertime, damn if I mind
What 'bout in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Man my four-year-old son can rap better than that nigga,
And we looking alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
So I'm a trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
I'd see you in my bed,
Go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me, we got people to meet and many places to see, Heyy
I'm the baddest My chick bad
And I stay with more bullets than yo' Billboard singles Ho that is just too much! You just gotta give applause
Twenty thou says that I'm the only nigga WIT IT,
I cant get my mind off youoowhoo
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!
And buckle dance than you expect
What's wrong?! The club and moon is full
Get her hot 'cause I make that ass melt
Get lit (Get lit)
She retired a little bit early because her son is fukin paid
Disturbin tha Peace Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia [Chorus: x2]
