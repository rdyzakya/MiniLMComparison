(Closing time) I swear it happened just like this
And I just don't care what happens next
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
When I've seen through the horror
The sweet indifference
While we're waiting
Ah, give or take a night or two
I listen all night for your step on the stair But I know from your eyes
Everybody knows the good guys lost
I could not hate
But born again is born without a skin
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in the pool
I just want to hold you, won't let me hold you
Cloués à leurs amours.
But the rumors of my virtue
Comfort in the night
And quiet is the thought of you
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
In arbitrary space
You feel the devil's riding crop
Somebody who
I told you when I came I was a stranger Give me back my broken night
And then taking from his wallet
My father he came in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Swallowed up the world
And springtime starts but then it stops
We kill the flame Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
And by all that I have done wrong
Sounded like the truth
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
You don't need to surrender
I finally got my orders
And who but you would take me in
Behind the veils of sheer deceit Our perfect porn aristocrat
And if you want a doctor
We don't like children anyhow
And it's time to go
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
We mostly fall, we mostly run
I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times
Et ma patrie, helas! (And my native land, alas!)
Is it too late I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me,
Oh, I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long Yes, you who must leave everything that you cannot control
I call it service. Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist,
I've got to have your word on this
What a lovely night that would be.
And all I've said was just instead of
This bowl of lies You serve them well
As time cannot decay
When the day has been ransomed
Something absolutely wrong
That you are down but you're ok
Thought by thought They whisper still, the ancient stones
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
Until the nights grew colder. She used to wear her hair like you
The monkey and the plywood violin
You'd been to the station to meet every train, and
Who by very slow decay
I never said that I was brave Oh, so long, Marianne
To clear our minds
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,
I struggled with some demons
If I forget
We used to do Goodnight goodnight
Then the cat ate the crust
I will help you if I must
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. And may the spirit of this song,
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Well, he talks like this you don't know what he's after
Sometimes you go outside
The war was lost
One mean guitar I guess I'm just
Her features covered by her fallen gown
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz Wasn't hard to love you
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night
When I'm clean and I'm sober
I better take my place
A wife commands And all of this
And the moon is swimming naked
I never had their sweet
To determine who will serve and who will eat
Though the heart be still as loving,
And you say okay, the bridge or someplace later And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
It's not because I'm dead
With a garland of freshly cut tears? I, I-I-I
Show me the place, where the word became a man
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
But it wont unwind
Where love has been confined
He'll never need to deal another
But closing time (closing time, closing time, closing time) I loved you when our love was blessed
And he circled us
Et je te garde Dis-moi c' qui s' passe à Trois-Rivières
Like my pardon's in the mail You got me wishing
Ah, you should have seen us
As she came riding through the dark;
Come healing of the limb Now the flames they followed joan of arc
that hides behind the cause and the effect And you who were bewildered by a meaning
A sacrifice recovering
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through." Passing through, passing through ... (let's do it one more time) Passing through, passing through ... The birds they sang
All dressed to kill
You ditch it all to stay alive
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
Save the last dance, the very last dance for me Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women
Has given up
Had to be people I hated
Tell me that you love me then Amen
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
Hallelujah Hallelujah
What my life would seem to me
It is murder Things are going to slide
To the USA Si tu savais comme on s'ennuie
I crossed the line I was not caught
A dreamer who
You live some life
I said, "father change my name."
I will never, never let you go
The only song I ever had You got me singing
The wind in the trees
Yeah the wars they will
I'd say please (please)
By the rivers dark
That was called love for the workers in song
Even when you bend to give me
Et je danse en disant ton nom,
To get me to the heart of this or any other matter
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
I said "now you're out, what are you going to do? "
She said, I'm tired of the war,
Don't give your heart to anyone
Or none of it is true
There's truth that lives
My once so bright
For a while I choose the rooms that I live in with care
Then we'll come from the shadows Les Allemands étaient chez moi
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Like a lily to the heat
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
And surely she would answer
I left so much behind
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!" This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
Beneath the lunar sway
Not by begging on his knees
And you know I'm strong and holy
The band is playing Auld Lang Syne
That he only has permission
All your praises they shall ring
A thousand kisses deep I loved you when you opened
To get inside
I'll be marching through the morning
Only now
The things I knew
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Or only want to walk with me a while across the sand
Je te regarde et m'émerveille
A light that doesn?t need to live
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years There's an attic where children are playing
When the filth of the butcher
I need you now And here they take their sweet repast
Is washed in the blood of the lamb
And youve got so much more to loose. It's just a man,
You've stared at the sun,
But something makes you turn around
Wasn't hard to love you
Ever since the river died
Obscure and obsolete
Là où la vie a tant à faire
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside
To lift the little bud
Oh please let me come into the storm Sometimes I find I get to
I'll wear a mask for you
The odds are there to beat
Turned my back on the angel too Now I'm living in this temple
If I, if I have been untrue
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
The air feels sharp
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
Parfois je pense à toi si fort
Like their father or their dog just died
If there is a choice
That are deeper than any goodbye Had to go crazy to love you
In my secret life I bite my lip
You side with them
The inner door flies open
Now they've fallen in love
But that doesn't make a fool of me
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
You live your life as if it's real
I told you when I came I was a stranger
You said just drink it up Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey
Now I am too thin
Month by month
Dance me to the end of love
You were moving so fast
Seemed the better way
The holy places where the races meet
That this survive
(There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love) I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus
Un jour, triste et pensif, (One day, sad and pensive,)
Lift this glass of blood
It's au revoir
We were running for the money and the flesh.
He shed his scales to find the snake within
On the dock of the bay,
There's a voice that sounds like god to me
Like a knight from some old-fashioned book
I live it wide
Oh mighty ship of State
He said, "talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.
'Till the night is gone
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right Store Room Its not the wind that keeps you up,
Through layers of time
Even tho' it all looks grim
You were not there before
Pick up their dusty tails,
Has passed through the eye of the camp
And I got it worse than you I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup
There's a tree where the doves go to die
And all my faith to see
Your little winning streak
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again Well, you know that I love to live with you
You much prefer the gentleman I was before.
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer
In my secret life I saw you this morning
And he cut my heart.
Pour passer l' temps quand y est trop long
The cross you left behind
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
And everybody knows that you live forever
And I even heard the angels declare it from above
Do we understand
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And none of us deserving
And the machinery for change
Those who weep begin
Who was hunting me. By the rivers dark,
"men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
To the one beneath the smoke.
You'll see a woman
Every heart, every heart to love will come
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
But don't forget who's takin' you home
The lake, a lady's mirror
Which is to say what I have told him
But that isn't what I need him
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
The cradle of the best and of the worst
There'll be fires on the road
I cheat and I lie
And broken bones to teach
Slow is in my blood I always liked it slow:
In the cave at the tip of the lilly
To complete I want to make him certain
Did I ever need you
I know you had to cheat
And I will leave with you one broken man
And there's nothing you can give her,
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
J'ai la France entière Un vieil homme dans un grenier
That's how it goes
He took the dust of joan of arc,
There's many that you'll see
Without your clothes
There is no drum
And the break of day
Was so complete
But now you're worried that I just might win
Let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the reason
My fallen star I'm running late
For he's touched your perfect body with her mind Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
That's all, I don't even think of you that often. I've seen you change the water into wine
And stuff it up the hole
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,
Everybody knows And everybody knows that it's now or never
Here's my lullaby Sleep baby sleep
Silence has a way of speaking
That any liar couldn't say as well
And promises to keep
All your turns are tight
Hanging upside down
And radiant beyond your widest measure
Hallelujah Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
I live among you
I was running, he was walking
But there were chains so I hastened to the hay
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
And no one knows where the night is going
"i never walked away.
I just can't believe the static coming on
Held you for a little while
That song of Bernadette So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
All the boys are waving
And you think you maybe you'll trust him
And the white man dancing
That's how the light gets in Come over to the window, my little darling
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
You know who I am Seemed the better way
Changing from nothing to one. Sometimes I need you naked,
I'll wear a mask for you You can dance every dance with the guy
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
I tried I failed You turned me in
To repeat Going home
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
The last dance for me>
Mais on est tous de bons larrons
Then the soldiers came
Thought by thought I stumbled out of bed
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again For now I need your hidden love
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
We'll be going down so deep
The windows are small and the walls almost bare
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And I fought every man for her
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
To make it real If the sun would lose its light
You got me singing
You know who I am I cannot follow you, my love,
And high above the wedding guests
To let me sing From this broken hill
You want it darker
To turn the other cheek Sounded like the truth
The value of my pardon
His blue eyes they were shining
I said, "how come the men here suffer like they do? "
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
And assert the majesty of creation! Maybe I'm still hurting
I'm not making a claim
And love itself have rest.
And who shall I say is calling? If you want a lover
A thousand kisses deep I'm turning tricks I'm getting fixed
You never will, you never did
I didn't even know there was a war. Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed,
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
My Oh My Oh My Drove you to the station
I need you now All at once the torches flare
My holy song
Won't be nothing
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
We stopped to drink some wine
Everybody knows Everybody knows that you love me baby
With the beauty of the word And if you call me brother now
The sweetness restored I don't need a reason
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
You came upon this highway. Traveling lady stay awhile
And the fields they're under lock and key
Now I would attack I stormed the old casino
They tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
That rise above the rot
The wretched beast is tame
I buy what I'm told
When I lay upon a mountain
The Maestro says it's Mozart
She said "no you cannot see
For trying to change the system from within
But for me you would make an exception.
And all your work it's right before your eyes Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied
When I was friends
A weekend on your lips
On a different point of view I was fighting with temptation
Amen
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
His body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you
That's how broken I would be
Oh, like a bird on the wire
And my voice be still
But once or twice they let me play
I'm old and I've had to settle
Amen I knew that it was wrong
The winter's tuning up
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
(I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those) Ah, you loved me as a loser
In my secret life
That goes down in every kitchen
Et à Québec
Ah but no you cannot see
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
He just doesn't have the freedom
And if you want to work the street alone
Everybody knows you've been discreet
Does it really matter
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
While Suzanne holds her mirror And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
You cannot follow me.
Back in November The lemon trees blossom
To mend the damage that we've done
I'm the little Jew
And I love your solitude, I love your pride. Then fire, make your body cold,
