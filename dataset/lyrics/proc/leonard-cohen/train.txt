That I made and I could not keep
and there's nothing you want to take
So late into the night,
Des pays etrangers. (in foreign lands.)
Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
For such a lonely choice
There's nothing left to do
Oh, a hundred floors above me in the Tower of Song I was born like this, I had no choice
I'm just trying to slow it down The ponies run, the girls are young
The chain's too tight
Let the rivers fill
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
And then she'd weave it on a loom
Pour voir un peu, pour voir encore
And my heart is like ice
You're only ten
To wash my eyelids in the rain Oh, so long, Marianne
So darlin' save the last dance for me Oh, I know that the music's fine
Than before Going home
I smoked a cigarette
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love I'm aching for you baby
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you
Like a sage, a man of vision
The dove is never free Ring the bells (ring the bells) that still can ring
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Dans les rues sales et transversales
But it's not the truth today I wonder what it was
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
It's over, it ain't going
So darling, save the last dance for me Oh baby, won't you save the last dance for me?
It's something in between, I guess
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the limb Behold the gates of mercy
And those were the reasons and that was New York
And then she clearly understood
A thousand kisses deep I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
Is fastening my ankle to a stone Now so long, Marianne
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind,
A thousand kisses deep Like a bird on the wire
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I don't like your fashion business, mister
Kept us hidden in the garret
Busted in the blinding lights
And say the Mea Culpa which you've probably forgot
It still is for those of us left.
Standing there in the doorway?
I waited half my life away
That's what my momma said All your moves are swift
He'll say one day you caused his will
Even tho' the news is bad
Where I could not see
They slip between the sentries of the heart Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
I hope that you can just let it go by
With me it's got to last It's not because I'm old
On a chair with a dead magazine
Turned my back on the angel too They ought to give my heart a medal
Closing time I loved you for your beauty
There's no one left to torture
And who shall I say is calling? And who by brave assent, who by accident
My sister, hold on tight
And if you want another kind of love
In case they want to know
I will kill you if I must
And I missed you since the place got wrecked
And something in me yearns to win
And who are you? she sternly spoke
I'll get here when I do
But wont unwind
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
It's coming through a crack in the wall
through your window
We're alone and I'm listening
In some hallway where love's never been
Then why do I feel alone?
Yeah let's do something crazy,
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
Well, it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded (baby)
And I need you to kill a child.
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
I'm out of the game
I practiced every night, now I'm ready
I used to play
That ruins your mind
Whom I will teach you to repair.
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger And then leaning on your window sill
Are lost and lost again And no one knows where the night is going
Wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge:
I will speak no more
That he doesn't need a vision
That's what my momma said I'm slowing down the tune
There's no one in sight
I don't like what happened to my sister
I saw the glory in her eye.
And my father's hand was trembling
Its not the thumbnail of a screen
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
The poison enters into everything And I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I panicked on.
I forget to pray for the angels
So we struggle and we stagger
The broken-hearted few
When you've got to go on waiting
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
I've seen the nations rise and fall
"please let me start again,
Drove you to the station
It was high and fine and free
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up
Of the altar and the mall
In the winter of 67
The open-hearted few And no one knows where the night is going
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hallelujah You say I took the name in vain
I know that kind of man, it's hard to hold the hand of anyone
(I, I-I-I) Baby, I've been waiting,
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right
Your naked body?" Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
I'm your man If you want a lover
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Though he knows he's really nothing
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Took my breath away Your crazy fragrance all around
And I call to you, I call to you
I gave to one and all
Day by day
It was you who built the temple,
That's when you've got to play it dumb
And that was called love for the workers in song
Well I am the one who loves
The treaty signed There's truth that lives
And who shall I say is calling? And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
With facts and lies
Dance me to the end of love Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
From the store room, Its not the wind that keeps you up,
I'm leaving the table
Va dire a mes amis (go tell my friends)
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Thy people shall be my people ...
A million candles burning for the help that never came
And "welcome, welcome" cries a voice
And I can't forget, I can't forget
From the river dark. And he covered me,
Assis au bord des flots, (sitting by the flowing waters,)
Some among you
I was dying to get back home
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
They'll never catch us
But there were so many people you just had to meet
That are deeper than any goodbye I had to go crazy to love you
And I'm neither left or right
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
À la Manicouagan. Tell me again
That he doesn't have a burden
And kept the vision in her soul
And the guards are taking aim
Que je me souviens d'eux. (that I remember them.)
With a mighty expectation of relief
In every style of passion And no one knows where the night is going
But I don't call soft enough
Well, I see Jane's awake
That the heart has got to open
Give me absolute control
I live the life
I always liked it slow
Why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning. Well I live here with a woman and a child,
And all the senses rise against this
It's lonely here,
(It?s been too late for years) But you look good, you really do
Her naked body [Dedicated to Irving Layton] So we'll go no more a-roving
like a spoon you turn and you turn
You were famous, your heart was a legend.
The day's on the run
I got this rig that runs on memories
Yeah the widowhood
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
Had nothing to reveal
What can I possibly say?
And bind us tight
That a voice be true
And I'd claw at your heart, and I'd tear at your sheet
If you want to strike me down in anger
Thought to keep A record of
From ghosts like you In places deep
No moon to keep her armour bright,
That this ain't exactly real
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
And while he talks his dreams to sleep you notice there's a highway
Could ever heal
I am the distance you put between
We used to do
Who could love you forever Did I ever love you
Forgive me if I inquire
If I didn't have your love
Here's my lullaby Well the mouse ate the crumb
Et la fleur dans l'abeille Que deviennent quand j'suis pas là,
I never could decide
I took my gun and vanished. I have changed my name so often
The situation makes me kind of nervous.
Was it ever over
I was running for the money and the flesh
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love (There ain't no cure for love)
I belonged at last
Then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon
Et tout c' qu'on fait avec
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
When first I heard him speak
I told you when I came I was a stranger But now another stranger seems
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says "I guess you call this love"
And the white man dancin' Give me back the Berlin wall
Our spoons, our knives The games of luck
Still dancing cheek to cheek
Who in mortal chains, who in power
There were chains, so I loved you
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
How good that feels, how sweet My mirror twin, my next of kin
That smashed the cosmic model
My friend stole my sweetheart from me I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That you could feel
Show me the place, I've forgotten I don't know
I'd wake up every morning by your side The years go by, you lose your pride
it is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
We kill the flame They're lining up the prisoners
Its not the moon
But we had names
That blinded every view
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
Its not the snow
I turned my back on the devil
(Closing time) The whole damn place goes crazy twice
Glad that I ran into you.
À coeur de jour
Comme le fleuve dans la mer
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons (guided)
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton
(No cure for love, there ain't no cure for love) There was a child named Bernadette
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song I said to Hank Williams, how lonely does it get?
In my secret life Hold on, hold on, my brother
Past the women whom you bought
Thought by thought Steer your path through the pain
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
I'm traveling light Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel
I wonder what they meant
The baffled king composing Hallelujah Hallelujah
That tore the light apart
But I caught the darkness baby
Through the graves the wind is blowing
I thought it was there for good so I never tried And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
I guess they won't exchange the gifts
That I wore I love to speak with Leonard
For the last 200 million years.
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
When the rest of the culture
Or "why has thou forsaken me?" And no one knows where the night is going
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood.
(Closing time)
When you're begging for a crumb
But there's nothing really happening
And the moon be still as bright.
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
As it was before
Mais moi, je joue de mes amours
And a cold and bitter wind
They'll close the bar
The order of the soul
You got away, they can't pay you now
Across the old table Was it ever settled
Show me the place Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Les Allemands l'ont pris
spill a little coffee from your cup
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again We met when we were almost young
Even though the world is gone
Nothing left to do
Are just a shining artifact of the past
We didn't see her coming for us
I've got these excuses
A thousand kisses deep I love to speak with Leonard
Her braids and her blouse all undone Sometimes I'd head for the highway
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
All of the moments that we will be. You know who I am,
With the photographs there, and the moss
When you know that you've been taken
So elegant and cheap
Dance me to the end of love I saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary
Let the hills rejoice
Well that's how broken I would be
Then my father built an altar
But you make me forget so very much
You must not do it anymore
And in whose arms you're gonna be
To make it real If the stars were all unpinned
There's a blaze of light
I want to get there last So baby let me go
To purify the blood And let the heavens hear it
Lay down his hand like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And there was nothing left
You win a while and then it's done
I'll never get it right
To the broken heart above Let the heavens falter
And the judgments are severe
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. "i never never turned aside," he said,
Her way again
Standing in the rain and sleet Who loved you with his frozen love
Où tu es toujours la plus belle,
And it has overturned
I will step into the ring for you
The stones we cut
If you're squeezed for information,
Whither thou goest, I will go. (taken from the Book of Ruth, ch.1; v. 16) Ah we're drinking and we're dancing
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And now the wheels of heaven stop
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
The marriage spent
It's here the family's broken
Destroy another fetus now
And everybody knows And everybody knows that the Plague is coming
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
Going home
A thundercloud
Down the snakes and up the ladder
You were talking so brave and so free
In a fundamental way
Park the car and hit the trail
Oh well that's where I would be
And you never have been tempted
But the story's still the same
I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song Yeah, my friends are gone and my hair is gray
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
Temptation caving in Your crazy fragrance all around
Ah, they don't let a woman kill you, not in the Tower of Song Now, you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
You were in it for your beauty too
I loved you baby, way back when
Of the me and you
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
I wonder what they meant There'll be the breaking of the ancient
And are we still leaning
And where I would surrender
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
The guests are coming through
Of creation and the fall
Can he walk you home, you must tell him no
But they'll never ever find that cure for love
It counts against me anyhow
For the money and the flesh
She saw the Queen of Heaven once
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost It`s going to happen very soon.
Over every living soul
You lose your grip and then you slip
For what I became
Mon pays malheureux, (my unhappy country,)
My mirrored room, my secret life
And summoned now to deal
But, you see, my hands were tied
And I miss you so much
I'm your man Ah, the moon's too bright
To let me sing If it be your will
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again Your letters, they all say that you're beside me now
Oh theres nothing left to choose
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
Closing time Oh the women tear their blouses off
Only one of us was real and that was me I haven't said a word since you've been gone
Parcourait en pleurant (travelled while crying)
A war between the man and the woman.
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To be his one, to be his only bride.
Even though it isn't welcome
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
Heart of Chevrolet
But I know what is wrong
Show me the place, where you want your slave to go The troubles came, I saved what I could save
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
He said, "one world must come out of world war two" (ah, the fool)
I left behind There's truth that lives
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night
And all the lousy little poets
And his axe was made of gold Well, the trees they got much smaller
It was just the other night
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
Nevermind
I?d know you in my sleep
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
And bought again
And I know from your smile
Come healing of the altar
And one by one the guests are cast beyond the garden wall And no one knows where the night is going
My Oh My Oh My Wasn't hard to love you
You'll never find The story's told
And when she came back she was nobody's wife Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
I'd like to carry on You got me singing
Pour ceux qui s'aiment Si tu savais comme on s'ennuie
I dug some graves
Was I ever someone
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love
Names so true
But now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger
Another mile of silence while I'm
You try the handle of the road, it opens, do not be afraid
We're closing time
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
It was you who covered up my face." Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
Just when all the bills are due
At the break of day
With a big bouquet of cactus
Nothing you can measure anymore
And the mountain's going to shout Amen
Toi que j'aimerai jusqu'au trépas,
Vous etes disparus... (you have vanished...)
Show me the place where the suffering began The troubles came, I saved what I could save
The heart beneath is teaching
From the store room, And now the woman by your side
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Nothing left to do
His secondhand physique
I've got you like a habit
Si t'as pas grand'chose à me dire,
There is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
When the sweetest voice I ever heard whispered to my soul
In their rags of light
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
I'm ready, my lord Hineni
I suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes
I love you, oh so much You can dance, go and carry on
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new
I will kill you if I can
All your children here
And it's not what dying does
Before it blows
But the darkness got that too I shoulda seen it coming
May it be a shield for you,
And they're going to hear from me (Ring, ring, ring, ring)
I like to linger as it flies
Must be my double
A manual for living with defeat A cry above the suffering
And I know what I must do
There ain't no entertainment
Such as fundamental goodness
There were chains so I loved you like a slave Show me the place
Where they tell you what to do
I made it to the forward deck
I know this love is real
Deep in the green lilac park
And the dealer wants you thinking
I will steer for you
On the same
Though the night was made for loving,
When the angels are panting
And mercy on our uniform
And my wedding ring, I did not know
Though these wars you did not start
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
You were young and it was summer
The doctors working day and night
With your bugle and your drum
Forget your perfect offering
You were talking so brave and so sweet,
And I guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
A lifetime in your eyes I always liked it slow:
All your sheep and your lillies of snow I, I-I-I
Spring must be on
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul
Tho' there be a god or not
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost I, I-I-I
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
Pour la nuit nous a caché
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of
There's no one left to blame
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
I said this can't be me
All of the moments that we will be.
I heard them say
It was right behind your eyes
You just threw it all to the crowd
No one believed what she had seen
There is a war between the left and right,
With one or two
Coming back to you And they're handing down my sentence now
But like a refugee (Ring, ring, ring, ring)
And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
The door is open you can't close your shelter
I'm not surprised
We are ugly but we have the music." And then you got away, didn't you babe
I know you can feel it
Didn't have to try
Saying this she climbed inside
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Well shes awake
Your private life will suddenly explode
But it's not the truth today I better hold my tongue
Ah, but a man never got a woman back
I will sing to you
I don't need a lover, no, no, no
Man of peace or man of war
Without a trace
We're spending the treasure, oh no, no
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
I do what I have to do
O longing of the arteries
Who wrote the Bible
Imperial, mysterious
Of smoke and gold and breathing. And why are you so quiet now
You chose your journey long before
From the store room, Its not the news of burning towns
The almond trees whither
When I knew was easy, the darkness was the price. I don't smoke no cigarette, I don't drink no alcohol
A war between the odd and the even. Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden,
From this broken hill
A shield against the enemy. Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
I will surrender there
And I know
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
We used to do Traveling light
Give me back the Berlin wall
You told me again you preferred handsome men
Why, I'm fire, he replied,
With a deadly force,
Ring the bells that still can ring (ring the bells that still can ring)
To a kitchen chair
I need you to carry my children in
Before I let you take me home Now so long, Marianne
It's yours now, it's all that there is (La-la-la, la-la-la)
And I had no strength
She cried to me, "hey, why not ask for more?"
My life would seem to me
I guess that's mother nature's way
I want a face that's fair this time,
When you're waiting
He said to me, "you must not ask for so much"
Hes got nothing left to choose
I was cautioned to surrender
It's here they got the range
She will be caught again
The one I'm using now it's covered up
And nobody trying to leave Sometimes I'd head for the highway
Who in solitude, who in this mirror
Do not choose a coward's explanation
I need you, I don't need you
My lost, my lost was saying found
Democracy is coming to the USA It's coming from the sorrow in the street
Here I stand
Bought and sold
It is not yours.' And he gave the wind
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
It?s in between I freeze
And the band is really happening
(Busted in the blinding lights)
Who was waiting there
But that's always been your call
Don't need no starting gun It's not because I'm old
Has crossed the threshold
I changed my clothed to black
When he speaks like this you don't know what he's after Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Écris cent fois les mots «Je t'aime»:
The poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue
And even though
Why don't you come on back to the war, can't you hear me speaking? Show me the place, where you want your slave to go
Like a prisoner in a jail
Mon éternelle Nous autres on fait les fanfarons
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
A thousand kisses deep And sometimes when the night is slow
Or I'd crawl to you baby and I'd fall at your feet
On all these burning hearts in hell
But it's written in the scriptures
So darling, save the last dance for me So don't forget who's taking you home
I didn't have a doubt
From the wars against disorder
The blunted mountains weep
From the store room, It's four in the morning, the end of December
It goes like this
I left behind I live it full
Tu m'écrirais bien plus souvent
Without my sorrow
It is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
The minor fall, the major lift
I?m old but I?m still into that
Did I ever fight you
Who for his greed, who for his hunger
If you were here I?d kneel for you
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
Who in your merry-merry month of may
And every word I speak
Or to make some woman smile." Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
The way you kill
Be fought again
Through the Squalls of hate
When I was a soldier,
Trying to catch your eye
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
When you wake up
I saw there were no oceans left
From the store room, Oh go to sleep and change the locks
And the ones who say there isn't.
But the room just filled up with mosquitoes, they heard that my body was free
Their graves are safe
Had to do time in the tower
If you want a father for your child
I know I'm not your lover. Steer your way through the ruins
Her star beyond my order
And I know it must have hurt you,
Into the masterpiece
A war between the black and white,
To get by
The great event which will end the horror.
I just had to take a dive
O mighty ship of State
That's an order Give me crack and anal sex
With everything. By the rivers dark,
We gather up our hearts and go
I had to leave my life behind
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
His golden arm dispatching cards
Let's see if we're that strong
Come healing of the body
Since you are a shining light
You're wanted back in town
I'll do anything you ask me to
So darlin' save the last dance for me Baby, don't you know I love you so
And I myself decided
Can't seem to loosen my grip
It's just that I can't speak
We could sit around and talk it over
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand I, I-I-I
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even,
I don't know which
They love you on the street
Show me the place, where you want your slave to go Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
And I know from her smile
That you know what I'm thinking
And a long-stem rose
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
That's how the light gets in We asked for signs
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I am guided) Ah remember me, I used to live for music (baby)
coming like a headlight
Some call love The high indifference
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
From the wells of disappointment
No one believed what she heard
I can't forget but I don't remember what
And that's how I want to end it
I said all my faith to see
Show me the place where my head is bend and low
I've seen the future, baby
And his voice was very cold He said, "I've had a vision
I will help you if I can When it all comes down to dust
In your body and your thought
(There ain't no cure for love)
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I need you now And those who dance, begin to dance
And mercy, mercy in this world So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
And me I'm up there waiting
I wonder what they meant When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent) In my secret life
Everybody knows that it's me or you
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
If the night is long
(But you see that line there moving through the station?)
Had to be no one at all I'm tired of choosing desire
Everybody knows the war is over
Dragging its tail in the sea And I'll dance with you in Vienna
Then he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm
Even tho' it all went wrong
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Hallelujah
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
(That cure for love)
But love's the only engine of survival
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
I will play the Moonlight Sonata backwards. This will reverse the effects of the world`s mad plunge into suffering,
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
There'll be phantoms
But the heart will not retreat I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray
You see I?m just another snowman
Y en a qui jouent de la guitare,
Whom you despise This was your heart
I love you now there's nothing left
More intimate Names so deep and
And we lived an endless night
Leads back to you
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I'd really like to live beside you, baby)
And doesn?t need to die A riddle in the book of love
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
And I promise, cross my heart,
(I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those) And I thank you for those items that you sent me, ha ha ha
I'm old and the mirrors don't lie
Save the last dance for me Oh, I know that the music's fine
For letting go of you
Though many tried
My don't was saying do Let's keep it on the level
Everybody knows Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Beggin' my crazy to quit I had to go crazy to love you
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah I don't believe you'd like it,
Oh, you've seen that man before
A man like me don't like to see
Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima
And truth that dies Nevermind
A shred of light, a particle away
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
That is far more real than you
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
Even though they know they're only passing through" Passing through, passing through ... I was with franklin roosevelt's side on the night before he died.
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
And you know that you can trust her
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt
Everybody knows that you really do
The peacock spreads his fan I'm traveling light
I'm sorry for the ghost I made you be
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
The holy dove
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. "then let me start again," i cried,
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on
Don't dwell on what
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
I sit at your table every night
Who by high ordeal, who by common trial
And see your face And if no leaves were on the tree
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
Ring the bells that still can ring
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
For scavengers like me
So nevermind Nevermind
One more thin gypsy thief
Through the squalls of hate
Everybody knows Everybody knows Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
The open-hearted many
(Closing time) Yeah the women tear their blouses off
D'autres qui jouent d' l'accordéon
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
I'm back on boogie street
And everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody knows
Tho' I have no right to ask
I live my life
Au courant fugitif (to the fleeing current)
I lived my life
We used to do But if the road
Broke a minute later
And I love you now there's nothing left
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
Nobody cares if the people
A thousand kisses deep But I?m still working with the wine
When you choose the precious few
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
Democracy is coming to the USA Sail on, sail on
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,
To make it real The door it opened slowly
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Waiting for the miracle
If I, if I have been unkind
The god of love preparing to depart
Those who earnestly are lost
Everybody knows it's coming apart
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
Do not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for this to happen
I'm burning up the road
I blessed our remnant fleet
Our little love would last
Je le lirai cent fois...
Giving me head on the unmade bed,
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
Did I ever want to Did I ever leave you
Expressions of
They're blood to me
For your ribbons and bows
Never equal to the task
Since the end of World War II Nothing left to do
And I know Suddenly the night has grown colder
It's written there in blood
It's closing time Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
When I turned my back on the devil
And the laws of remorse are restored
The bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide
I looked for you in everyone
It's not the life I led
Who was waiting there,
So blow out the flame There's nobody missing
Come healing of the name O longing of the branches
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah baby, let's get married
Steer your way through the fables
You don't even try to prove that the noise is
Everybody got this broken feeling
That night that you planned to go clear
You know I've watched you riding every day
A thousand kisses deep I?m good at love, I?m good at hate
The signs were sent
So nevermind Your victory
In my secret life I smile when I'm angry
Well I lived with a child of snow
From those nights in Tiananmen Square
You who were never the one
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
But if they do, just tell them it was me Yeah I loved you all my life
Who was hunting me. By the rivers dark
You saw her bathing on the roof
And then consented to be wrecked
You got me thinking
But I swear by this song
Ils me dirent, "résigne toi"
Live or die
May it rise up pure and free.
Que je me souviens d'eux. (that I remember them.) O jours si pleins d'appas, (O days so full of charms,)
And I tightened up my gut
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress. It was deep into his fiery heart
Living in a suit But he does say what I tell him
And I've taken the edge off my thirst
And the desert far away:
I know my days are few
There's a lullaby for suffering
And the cider's laced with acid
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous. You cannot stand what I've become,
This I could not do
All the women tear their blouses off
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin And who by fire, who by water
I'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet
And you're lying in the rain,
Which will end the sorrow.
Was I ever able
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
And we're still making love
You wouldn't like it here
I need you, I don't need you,
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
I ain't had much loving yet
We're busted in the blinding lights
It's closing time
(There ain't no drink, no drug) ah, tell them, angels
I got no taste for anything at all I used to love the rainbow
You got away, I never once heard you say,
But you know that I still love you
I try but I just don't get high with you I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I lived alone but I was only
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
In Babylon. By the rivers dark
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Ah, when you've done a line or two
Past the reefs of greed
That scrapes away your dream It's just this man,
And the night has no right to begin
But it sounds like bubble gum
I wonder what it meant
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
Has passed away
I live the life I left behind The war was lost
I shall abide until
I said "won't you let me see
Well shes is asleep
Et tes yeux de velours?
And it's not some idle claim
I'm not taking aim
Western code
Of my secret life Looked through the paper
I can't pretend I'm not
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame. Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
From the store room, Well go to sleep and change the locks
We're cutting the cord
That I wore He wants to write a love song
In full command of every plan you wrecked
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory And I know from her eyes
Coming back to you Ah they're shutting down the factory now
I've been waiting night and day
It's time that we began to laugh
From the ashes of the gay
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
The Hallelujah hymn You got me singing
What everybody knows And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Now it's much too late
À la Manicouagan
She died without a whisper There were three of us this morning
A wedding dress or something white
The clothes we wore
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
And deep into his fiery heart
They moved her not at all I changed my style to silver
I'm ready, my lord There's a lover in the story
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's coming like the tidal flood
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah Hallelujah
Ma main qui te fait signe d'attendre?
Come healing of the spirit
Yeah, the summer's gone
Let your mercy spill
I'd like to try to read your palm
On our skin
I'm just staying home tonight
Tell me over and over
If I could only hear you say
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. Un Canadien Errant (A wandering Canadian,)
Living in a suit If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
And end this night
The songs we made Our law of peace
The holy books are open wide
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moon light
I can't say much has happened since
But I was waiting
And witnessed here in time and blood
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
One by one they enter there
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
It's coming from the silence
Do not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for the occasion
He taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule
A scheme is not a vision
I am spoken for
Je me prolonge en toi
I've got this joy inside my breast
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
The beast won't go to sleep
For the grace of God in the desert here
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on It's coming to America first
Il est mort sans surprise Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
To make us well And draw us near
But they'll never-ever find that (cure for love), that cure for love
To wear upon my swollen appetite. Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
And here's a man still working for your smile If the sun would lose its light
And she's moving her body so brave and so free
J'ai repris mon âme J'ai changé cent fois de nom
In a wounded dawn,
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
Like those people of the past You got me singing
The file on you complete
Every time you gave them shelter
Everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody knows
And the day returns too soon,
The limits of the sea
From the latest hit
And then the angels forget to pray for us Now so long, Marianne
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love I walked into this empty church, I had no place else to go
My wedding ring
Is it too late
And is it still raining
Can't you feel it when we touch?
Everybody knows that the captain lied
The fragrance of those promises
And some of them are with me An old woman gave us shelter
And they called me on that too
In your picture frame
To want you to ignore his dreams
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
Coming back to you I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
It must have hurt your pride
I'm heading down to Phoenix
For a while Oh, sometimes I see her undressing for me
I ache in the places where I used to play
My Oh My Oh My All the boys are waving
It's closing time Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
Il adressa ces mots: (he addressed these words:)
A thousand kisses deep The ponies run, the girls are young
I haven't been this happy
Declaring, (declaring) declaring,declaring that your body's really you
I got this old address
And the flowers made of stone
And every drinker every dancer
With you it's got to go:
Which understands
and there's nothing you want to keep
In the name of something new
Take this waltz, take this waltz
"do you hate mankind for what they done to you? "
Let me catch my breath
Here's my lullaby
Hey I don't miss it baby
Don't give your heart to anyone And don't forget who's takin' you home
Here's my lullaby I cannot follow you, my love,
That will disclose
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
When it all comes down to dust
There's a morning to come
(I can't say much has happened since)
You want it darker Hineni, hineni
You said, we have all day
No man to get her through this very smoky night.
She tied you
To the wisdom of old
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter Ah, you hate to see another tired man
To think that I did not forget that child
In amorous array
And the blessing gone,
Let's be alone together
By a demon or a God You who stand above them now
Show me the place, where the suffering began I'm leaving the table
We've been alone too long
She said that you gave it to her
That's how the light gets in You can add up the parts
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. He said, "i locked you in this body,
My Oh My Oh My I tried to leave you, I don't deny
I will make it all up to thee I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
I've heard their stories, heard them all
If I ever loved you, oh no, no
Your bracelets and your brush
Hineni, hineni
Myself I long for love and light,
And me I was just getting even
(Closing time) Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked
My Babylon. I did not know
And I loved you when our love was blessed
When I've been to the river
À la Manic
And by the honor had your own restored
In lonely secrecy
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin (guided, guided by)
Hallelujah I did my best, it wasn't much
Coming round
You smiled at me like I was young it
An undivided love
I said "won't you let me see"
Any further
With your invincible defeat
Behind the curtain
A thousand kisses deep I know you had to lie to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
Car la laideur ne t'atteint pas,
And no water in the sea
For making your sweet little song
Try to say the grace I came so far for beauty
To the beach of Malibu
But you got away, didn't you, baby?
Like Bernadette would do The war was lost
Our little lives
That's how it would be
Come healing of the mind O see the darkness yielding
Waiting for the miracle to come When you've fallen on the highway
To the one who was never
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
Say their prayers out loud
A husband leads
Who was hunting me. And he cut my lip
The broken-hearted many
I swear it happened just like this
I'll disappear for you
For the miracle, for the miracle to come You got me singing
Mon bel amour,
And bring it to me now
You'd never choose I'm just a fool
But vengeance belongs to the Lord
Without this costume
I'm your man If you want a boxer
Well disguised It's coming through a hole in the air
At least you tried
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned Well, they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
We kill the flame If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
Next Tuesday, when the sun goes down,
As he died to make men holy
Between your love and mine They're dancing in the street, it's Jubilee
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's closing time (closing time)
I've so little time and I'm only passing through." Passing through, passing through.
And the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?
She said "no you cannot see"
I have a name
Share your toast maybe
Tell the people that you saw me passing through. I saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand,
And I know you sent me some
Is talking in tongues If your heart is torn
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
On the past
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
There were lots of invitations
If it be your will
From the store room, And now this woman by your side
That night that you planned to go clear Sincerely, L Cohen When they poured across the border
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
Some times you go outside
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
You see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song I see you standing on the other side
I'm the only one this evening
And my very close companion
Je te rejoins où que tu sois
I need you now
The fourth, the fifth
While the limousines wait in the street
And I saw within,
Who said they were through with dealing
Never asked you why
But crazy has places to hide in
A thousand kisses deep Confined to sex we pressed against
Giving me head on the unmade bed
My life behind
No these wars you did not start
Thought by thought Steer your way, o my heart
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
Across the old table Getting sick of starting over
They sing for him. Be the truth unsaid
And lie beside me, baby
Of every government
From the fires of the homeless
Ton front doux comme fine soie
And I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat
They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
Then he touched on death Sounded like the truth
She's the angel of compassion
And there is so much more to loose. Theres this man,
We should have said the things we felt
So nevermind I could not kill
Where the women kneel to pray
To where it's better
And I used to love the view
I didn't see the time,
And it's crowded and cold
A million candles burning for the love that never came
I've seen the future, brother
In every word
Ah but some of you was light
Then he gets you on her wavelength
I want a spirit that is calm." Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
neighbours making love. It's just a man,
And say the Mea Culpa which you gradually forgot
But I don't want to run
Il adressa ces mots: (he addressed these words:) "Si tu vois mon pays, (If you see my country,)
Remember me, I brought your groceries in (ooh, baby, yeah)
And I loved you for your body
I'm out of the game Sleep baby sleep
And every now and then we try
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
You're of their kind Nevermind
Of closing time
Both song and tree,
Without the sorrow
But they've summoned, they've summoned up
I thought the past would last me
Did you ever go clear? Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Come healing of the heart O troubled dust concealing
Dragging its tail in the sea There's a concert hall in Vienna
The sands of time were falling
Now I know just how much I have lost
I've been running through these promises to you
I don't wonder why
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
"yankee, russian, white or tan," he said, "a man is still a man.
I saw her wince, I saw her cry,
Your secrets all in view
With such a heavy hand
Je ne la verrai plus. (I will see it no more.)
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
What was rotten and what was fresh And men to do my bidding
I see you've gone and changed your name again
With roots entwined
I don't know how the river got so wide
To such a very hopeless voice I practiced all my sainthood
I'm not alone
Or in whose arms you're gonna be
As we went kneeling through the dark Oh, so long, Marianne
That they are building on some endless river
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
By the light of the moon. By the rivers dark
I guess you're right
"Just according to whose plan?"
Hineni They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
Saying "do reveal yourself"
Like Bernadette would do
An anthem of forgiving
Ring the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering
Cent fois cent fois c'est pas beaucoup
I love the country but I can't stand the scene
I don't even know the name
I introduced him/her to my loved one and while they were dancin'
I was not caught
My masterpiece unsigned One by one, the guests arrive
Who by avalanche, who by powder
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
He looked once behind his shoulder
It don't matter how it all went wrong
While house and grounds dissolve
And all of that jiving around. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
The present's not that pleasant
If I ever loved you
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song
He knew I would not hide You who build these altars now
Been working out but it?s too late
It all went wrong
Year by year
And maybe I had miles to drive
But now it's much too late
Trapped beneath the wall of snow
A thousand kisses deep The autumn moved across your skin
And you know that she will trust you
The gates of love they budged an inch
It's written in the scriptures
Then he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it
Sometime tomorrow
My naked body" So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
The shadow of my reach But no, I could not touch her
And you were waiting
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it,
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
"Let all my guests come in" And no one knows where the night is going
Soir et matin je tends les bras
From the brave, the bold, the battered
That tonight will be fine
You were my ground, my safe and sound
I'm just a station on your way,
Come healing of the mind And let the heavens hear it
Why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married. There is a war between the rich and poor,
Well, I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned
To sacrifice these children
You won't have the sum
I said is this contagious?
The river's going to weep,
They dont tear your sleep apart It's just a man,
So won't you let me see
But I must go on
Banni de ses foyers, (banned from his hearths,)
While the killers in high places
The gates of commitment unwired
There is no reward
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You can't divide My woman's here
I'm listening so hard that it hurts
About the blues
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Alexandra leaving with her Lord Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Your first commitments tangible again And you who had the honor of her evening,
You can smile every smile for the man
Steer your way past the palaces
It's coming from the feel
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
With that lawless crowd
I want to get there last It's not because I'm old
First he touched on love
You?d have to be a man to know
That love cannot afford
This swarm of flies
I need you now Those who dance, begin to dance
Hallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proof
My friends of that year they were all trying to go queer
Who knows he will be shot
Like Bernadette would do We've been around, we fall, we fly
That you were meant to keep
Like a beast with his horn
I want the kind of work I had before,
I meant it as a kind of trial.
And he said, â??This heart
Freedom soon will come
Then he threw the bottle over
I don't need a lover
Take its broken waist in your hand This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
Slide in all directions
For the sword outwears its sheath,
I have tried in my way to be free It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Traveling light like
Come healing of the limb O let the heavens hear it
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Signs for all to see I can't run no more
Without my burden
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
I need you now And all go stumbling through that house
If I knew your name You don't need a lawyer
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand
Je ne la verrai plus. (I will see it no more.) If it be your will
That I wore I'm going home
I can't forget but I don't remember who I'll be there today
To the shores of need
The birth betrayed
And the heart must pause to breathe,
Try to say the grace Seemed the better way
You want to get there soon
If it be your will If it be your will I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup
I don't know the people
I know you really loved me
It's feeling like the right decision
To refuse He will speak these words of wisdom
But must it come so cruel, and oh so bright? Did I ever love you
I'm cold as a new razorblade
From the sirens night and day
Dis-moi c' qui s' passe à Montréal,
Oh baby, won't you promise that you'll save
There is a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
But closing time
When an old friend I happened to see
But I hear him coughing all night long
But now it's come to distances and both of us must try
I've met a few
Mais je n'ai pas peur
As though they were the burden of some other
It is you my love, you who are the stranger Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
Had to go down to the pit
In my secret life I'm slowing down the tune
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through." Passing through, passing through ... I was with washington at valley ford, shivering in the snow.
Je recrée ton âme et ton corps
It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea
I can't turn the other cheek
That scrapes away your dream It's just a man,
I have tried in my way to be free Like a worm on a hook
Do not say the moment was imagined
I know I'm not your lover.
I don't need a pardon, no no, no no, no
It's a crying shame
From the staggering account
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
For a while And I know
Marching through the night
Except when she was sleeping,
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
I must do what I've been told"
To pose all hot and high
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
Dance me to the end of love Now I've heard there was a secret chord
And they ask you how you're doing
They're talking in tongues If your heart is torn
In our rags of light
Must I forget
My fallen star
Who knows he's been convicted
Our love would surely last You kept right on loving
We swore to each other then
Between your love and mine I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
But I didn't want to win
Of someone that I knew
The wretched and the meek
I wish there was a treaty
My children too
From a withered limb,
Amen Tell me again
Show me the place where the word became a man
On the me and you
So I could not drink
And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through I showed my heart to the doctor. He said I'd just have to quit
To have to stand beneath my window
I've been saved by a blessed fatigue
When the victims are singing
Thought by thought Steer your heart past the truth
And I could not see
In your culture
Oh my love, oh my love
They fall among the voices and the wine It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
And many still to be
Of the places we could hide You got me singing
We'll see the snow as it is melting
When I walked away from you
Another early morning, I'd pretend that it was you
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
The cruelty or the grace O solitude of longing
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all in a ruin I heard of a saint who had loved you, I studied all night in his school
Thinking of the past
Tell me again
My masterpiece unsigned I thought I'd be rewarded
Tell me that you want me then Amen
Those were the reasons and that was New York,
At the entrance of Mount Wilson
Only one of us was real and that was me I heard the snake was baffled by his sin
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Or are we still leaning
Sometimes I need you wild,
They're tired and they're lame
Forgot to dream
Why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us,
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex Oh, the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone
My cheap violin and my cross
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
Her braids and her blouse all undone There is a war between the rich and poor,
If you want a partner, take my hand, or
Waiting for the miracle to come I dreamed about you, baby
I'm your man And if you've got to sleep a moment on the road
They're dust to you There is no need
And scratching at the door to come in
Where it all goes on
Democracy is coming to the USA It's coming from the women and the men
(I love your body and your spirit and your clothes)
I just want to hold you, come on let me hold you
Who in the sunshine, who in the night time
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
And the soul outwears the breast,
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control,
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
To do my instant bidding
And please don't make me go there
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
That don't change the way I feel
If you want a driver, climb inside
Try me again
And the summer night is fragrant
I'm glad you stood in my way If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
But it might have been a vulture
In Babylon. Though I take my song
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Then we'll come from the shadows I asked my father,
If the sea were sand alone
I see your hand, I see your hair
And you handled me like meat
Thank God it's not that simple
I miss you since the place got wrecked
I've lost my wife and children
But I'm always alone
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war
Ça fera le plus beau des poèmes.
And I'll never get enough
The summer's almost gone
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
Little by little
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
Let us die to make things cheap
Just a lot of things to do
If I couldn't lift the veil
And my very sweet companion
Most of you was naked
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon
Steer your heart, precious heart
And he put his hand on mine Thought I saw an eagle
That's what my momma said I'm lacing up my shoe
And a paradox to blame
The treaty signed
But there were sorrows to be here
That I speak no more
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
Or what is yet to be
I heard the story long ago
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
For making your sweet little song I loved you for a long, long time
Got something in my eye
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.
I can't forget but I don't remember what I had to go crazy to love you
And I know what is right
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder You tell him to come in sit down
I thought we had all night I like to take my time
My lawless heart
That it's either black or white
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
From the homicidal bitchin'
And truth that dies
While the limousines wait in the street.
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
On a visionary flood of alcohol
Argument
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I'm guided by a signal in the heavens (guided, guided)
Everybody talking to their pockets
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah
And it's here the lonely say
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
And I'd die for the truth
You left when I told you I was curious
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
With all he is and all he was
(Closing time) The gates of love they budged an inch
Well disguised I had to leave
The frontiers are my prison Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Your servant here, he has been told
I got ready for the struggle
The Hallelujah song Whither thou goest, I will go;
You believed in yesterday
I think it's time to board another
Until the night is over.
It still is for those of us left
And you were starting out I said I best be moving on
And the wisdom of the way
Coming back to you Even in your arms I know
Except what we forgot to do
I need you now One by the guests arrive
Taking what he needs,
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
You can strike up the march
And no one that you hurt
Lifts a happy face to thank her
I never liked it fast
You just say you're out there waiting
You just turned your back on the crowd,
Show me the place
But a lot goes on forever
The story's told
You know you can
And your love is too vast But I know from your eyes
And I can't believe that time is
I need to see you naked
I went on a fast
And he stood so tall above me
Some call fate
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye You came to me this morning
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
She's a hundred but she's wearing
They were middle class and tame
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Coming back to you There are many in your life
Her nakedness unmanned I came so far for beauty
Feet away
Everybody knows what you've been through
You don't need to answer Did I ever leave you
You can use it for a weapon,
Or if you want to take me for a ride
Or take a trip
Something tight
A thousand kisses deep But you don?t need to hear me now
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
Take the only tree that's left
If he asks if you're all alone
Makes you wanna cry
You never dared to vow The splinters that you carry
That's how the light gets in
But there's nothing you can give her,
It doesn't matter which you heard
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
Like a spade Show me the place, where you want your slave to go
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Of the Sermon on the Mount
You were my aerial The fields are crying out, it's Jubilee
spill some coffee from your cup
Tell me that you need me then Amen
So he started up the mountain
You know who I am If you should ever track me down
I'll examine every inch of you
My patience and my family
From your fingers and your thumb
You said just drink it up. I got no future,
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again Oh, you are really such a pretty one
Had to let everything fall
I caught the darkness, drinking from your cup
Of course you'll say you can't complain
Probably still is for those of them left. Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,
To Babylon. Then he struck my heart
I'm ready, my lord Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
But nevermind Nevermind
Without the costume
I was nine years old
You came home without Lili Marlene And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And I swear it happened just like this
I hope you know it was never to you For like a baby, stillborn
The holy or the broken Hallelujah Hallelujah
I'm going to give you mine to hold,
He's a lazy bastard
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I caught the darkness drinking from your cup
Te tournes-tu vers la côte nord
Moving cross the borders
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost Even though she sleeps upon your satin
I've seen you change it back to water too
Get ready for the future
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
Such a cold and lonesome heroine.
I wandered on.
Start again
In Babylon. And I did forget
But I have many friends
This was once your mouth
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little shoe
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But I have to deal with envy
I wonder what they meant You don't know me from the wind
Tellement je t'aime Si tu savais comme on s'ennuie
But the brief elaboration of a tube Going home
"plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.
You always are I know you're right
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
In Babylon. Trav'ling lady, stay awhile
Our soldiers played
You own the world
Turned my back on the angel too O gather up the brokenness
She sends her regards And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What a sigh of relief, as the senile robins become bright red again, And the retired nightingales,
You're of their kin
