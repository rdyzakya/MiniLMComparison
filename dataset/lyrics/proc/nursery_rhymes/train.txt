    Jack Jingle went 'prentice
    Thursday's child has far to go,
    They found a bird's nest with five eggs in,
    And all the little young ones said:
    Sing a song of sixpence,
    And now my story's done.
    So they laid them down on the mat at the door,
    And a merry old soul was he;
    That ate the malt
      And the masts were made of gold.
    Now this little woman her living got,

COCK ROBIN'S COURTING
A AND B AND SEE
    John Cook was riding up Shuter's hill; he, haw, hum!
    Six little mice sat down to spin,
    The days are long,
    "What work can she do,
    For in this land they were not bought.
    He called for his pipe,
    I spent two pence of it, I spent two pence of it,
    And the tips of their tails,
    For in her hand she carried a broom.
    Went to bed with his breeches on,
        Come again, Jill!
    But this I know, and know full well,
    A kind, and sweet, and gentle child--
    The miller did swear
    Georgy Porgy ran away.
    That those who heard him could never stand still;
      If ever thou mean to thrive.
    The Queen did not like him, No more did the King;
    If you want any more you may sing it yourself; he, haw, hum!
    Down tumbles baby,
    For you never shut your eye
    And stole my little moppet away.
    I love you well, my little brother,
    J was a Joiner, and built up a House
      Thus, do you see?
    Come with a whoop, and come with a call,
      With my wing, wang, waddle, oh,
    Wilt thou now have me,
      And nothing could they find,
      Honey? quoth she;
      And nobody cares for me!"
    There was a cobbler clouting shoon,
    Thirty days hath September,
    And there he kept her very well.
    Bessy kept the garden gate,
    Build it up again with iron and steel,
    One day the sun was warm and bright,
    She loved coffee and I loved tea,
      And threw him down stairs.
    For diamonds are trumps,
    And this the burden of his song
    Gathering roses to give to the Queen.
    Handy Pandy, Jack-a-Dandy,

QUEEN ANNE
    Boys and girls come out to play,
    He would if he could,
    He bought some at a grocer's shop,
      Bat, bat,
    The pig flew up in the air;
    There was a piper had a cow,
    Was not that a dainty dish
      And snapped off her nose.

THREE CHILDREN SLIDING
    So, so, Mistress Pussy,
    To powder my locks
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.
    My first go,
    They all took one and left four in.
    A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up.
    There was a chandler making candle,
    Old Mother Goose, when
    He pulled off his cap, _an' drew_ off his glove,
      And when I bake,
      Then call your neighbours in.
    So Hector Protector was sent back again.
    "Ox, ox, drink water!
      We very much fear
      The cradle will rock;
    She went to the sempster's
    On our meat and on us all!
      The sea was thrown then,--
    Cock-a-doodle-do!
      But the wild duck flew away;
      To buy him some linen;
      And scratched out both his eyes:
      Beautiful daughter?"
    Your house is on fire, your children have gone,
    Heaving up my either hand;
    "I'll have that mouse," said the biggest cat.
      As sweet as the May.
      And Mary kept the pantry:
    I'll be chief mourner."
    And I will sing a pretty song."
    Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
THERE WAS A MAN
      Under the broom.
    A Pie sat on a pear-tree,
    And all the words he ever spoke
      Jack sing saddle oh,
    The maid was in the garden
      If she would say "I'll try."
    He follows his nose where'er he goes,
    That kept the cock that crowed in the morn,
        Pray keep them safe at home.
    Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall,
      Sat in a corner
    This is the end
      Fell sighing and sobbing
    "Buy me a milking-pail,
    Noddle goes your pate, and purple is your nose;
    For joy that he was in safety still,
    And then one night, when it was dark,
      All hung on a tree to dry.
    Look to thyself,
    N was a Nobleman, Gallant and Bold
    And sent it to mill;
    The fox and his wife they had a great strife,
    He ate the dormouse,
    Maids a-courting;
    Little girl, little girl, what gave she you?
    And that's half;
    Long legs, crooked thighs,
    Three little kittens lost their mittens,
    Pussycat Mew jumped over a coal,
      For baby and for me.
    Then up Jack got up, and off did trot,
    I lent him to a lady,
    There was a little woman, as I've been told,
    Three pretty girls were in them then,
    "Dog, dog, bite pig!
    And there let him die.
    "Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me?"
      A-sailing with the wind.
DANCE, LITTLE BABY
    In coal-scuttle fell he,
    Jack's goose and her gander
    Kissed the girls and made them cry.
    "With my little dish,
    The Robin and the Wren
    A penny white loaf,
    Merry was myself, and merry could I sing;
    What age may she be,

      The dog was laughing.
    The rat began to gnaw the rope;

    There I met a pretty miss,
    And a ring a ting tang,

MASTER I HAVE
market, and buy a little pig."
A WAS AN ARCHER
    He began to compliment and I began to grin,
    The Jew got the goose,
    And all the pretty maids are plain to be seen;
    So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
    And hung them up to dry;
      In them then, in them then?
      For they'd left all their tails behind them.
    For forty days 't will rain no more.
    Oh, there's none so rare,

    In a cottage in Fife
        There was a little man,
      To buy him some shoes;

      And soon the ball was lost.

    Cock Robin got up early,
      With its two little hands.
    And can't see me.
    As fair as a lily, as white as a wand.
    And ere the Robin got a spoon,
      Up to his little chin.
    She tried the keyhole in the door,
    Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, where have you been?
    A pretty thing she was, in my chimney corner sat;
    He tried at the nail,
    Says he, "I'll shoot you, silly bird,
    The lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown;
    And thus when once, my little dears,
    A, B, C, tumble down D,
    He worked and sang from morn till night,
    "May I go with you, my pretty maid?"
    The Dove says, coo, coo, what shall I do?
      To buy a fat pig;
    He stepped in a puddle right up to his middle,
    That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,
    Or else I'll beat you as black as a coal.

    She has no skill in a flattering tongue."
    "Oh, ho!" said the fox, "it's a very fine night
    You shall get a fishie when the boat comes hame!

    One stocking off, and one stocking on;

    THE MAN IN THE WILDERNESS
      She wanted to wander,
    I sold my cow, and I bought me a calf;
    Yankee Doodle came to town,
      He was dancing a jig.
THE LION AND THE UNICORN
      Sat hearing her canary.
BOYS _and_ GIRLS
      Out of the mustard-pot,

    I burnt my fingers, I feel it yet;
    R was a Robber, and wanted a Whip
    One, I love; two, I love;
    "My father's a farmer, sir," she said.
    I ploughed it with a ram's horn,

THE SONG OF MYSELF
    The robin and the red-breast,
    Within a fountain crystal clear,
    If you haven't got a penny, a ha'penny will do,
    I had a little boy,
    If turnips were watches, I would wear one by my side.
      Eating bread and honey;
    Over the water, and over the sea,
      All on a summer's day;
    The man in brown soon brought him down,

    Where she was going I couldn't but ask it,
    If I'd as much money as I could tell,
    What shall we do?
    Bobby Shaft is fat and fair,
    A sportsman chanced to come that way,
    And it points to the time

    Great A, little A,
    The mouse ran up the clock,

      Pippen Hill was dirty;
      While Mary lived in plenty.
    Out of France into Spain,
    If I'd as much money as I could spend,
      Dance to your daddie,
    There was a jolly miller once
    For early to bed
      I'll tell you by and by,
    And write their names with a pen and ink.
    One at my heart
    But I smell a rat close by.
        My love will come in,
She went a little farther and she met a dog.
      And so do we.
    And lay me on a bank to dry,
    "Oh, ho!" said the fox, "it's but a short mile

    Let them alone, and they'll come home,
    They all went together to seek a bird's nest.

    Caw, caw, says the crow;
    "Pray, Mistress Mouse, will you give us some beer?"
    And tho' victuals and drink were the chief of her diet,
    Because he bit my finger so.

THE LOVING BROTHERS
    The captain was a duck,
      Bad luck will surely follow.
      Sit by the fire and spin;
    Brian O'Lin had no breeches to wear,
    Tom took out his pipe and began for to play;
    Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef;

      And dreamt she heard them bleating;
she had lapped up the milk--

    In comes four legs,
sixpence.
    How shall we bring this matter about?
    Cut them on Friday, you cut them for sorrow;
    It's for her gold she must be sold;
THE QUEEN _of_ HEARTS
    I've been up to London to look at the queen.
    And runs away with one leg.
        "Should I be your little bride,
      That all the house was pothered:
    And you and I will keep ourselves warm.
    Is the way to be healthy
    For many a joyful day
      They both walked on their feet,
    There was a horse going to the mill,
    The pig was eat and Tom was beat,
    Silver bells,
    Who'll be the clerk?
    When he got to the top of the hill,
    Jack and Jill went up the hill,
    But the binding
    If all the world were apple-pie,
    Five and twenty on hands and feet.

    He sang Cock Robin's love
    They're round and sound and pretty,

    One had a mouse and the other had none,
    Often through my curtains peep,
    As little Jenny Wren
    Then they crept in, as quiet as mice,
    "Are the children in their beds, for it's past eight o'clock."
      Fol de riddle, lol de riddle, hi ding do,
    And over the water to Charley.
    Sat down for to chat;
    The reason why I cannot tell.
    "Yes, my Poll, I saw them pass,
    But he can't, so he don't!
    Diddle diddle dumpling, my son John,
    There was a little boy and a little girl,
    And down at one gulp house and old woman went.
    Johnny shall have a new bonnet,
      With chains about their necks.
    For want of the battle, the kingdom was lost,
    But the butcher would not.

I LOVE SIXPENCE
    Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
      And here's a foot for a shoe,
    Such joy there was at my wedding,
      "It will not go for nought."
      "I thought so," says Jack.
      Blessings light upon you!

    That married the man all tattered and torn,
      To buy him some hose;
    Then up she took her little crook,
    "My face is my fortune, sir," she said.
    But while they were all a merry-making,
    Maids a-waiting;
    Every cat had seven kits.
    The cupboard was bare,
    They began to quarrel and they began to fight;
    Hot July brings cooling showers
    But I'll have some of your very best flour,
        I have little more to say,
    One misty, moisty morning, when cloudy was the weather,

    So they fought and they fit,

    She went to the baker to buy her some bread,

    There were three jolly Welshmen,

    Jacky, come give me thy fiddle,
    How could he see where to go,
      In them then, in them then,
    "Making coats for gentlemen."
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
    He took out his pipe and played them a tune,
      At the break of day,
      My bonnie laddie,
    How many miles is it to Babylon?
      And nodded with her head,
    She stole oranges, I'm afraid;
      What should we do for drink?
      And shot it right through the head, head, head.
    With a merry ding-dong, happy let us be!
        The self-same thing will be.
      "I'll try, I'll try, I'll try."
    To see such craft,

    When Jack jumped in,
      He was riding a goat.

      The dog made a bow;
    He never took toll
      To any man alive.
      The girl in the lane, that couldn't speak plain,
OVER THE WATER TO CHARLEY
    Go to bed third,
      Without a wig,
    And all for the want of a horse-shoe nail!
    If this account be true,
    Do you go before, with bottle and bag,
     And loved by his usher and master;
    "Butcher, butcher, kill ox!

    And said to myself,
SEE, SEE!
LENGTHENING DAYS
    Dickory,
OLD WOMAN, OLD WOMAN
    He used his pipe, and she used her legs;
      Little Jack Horner
    He found a crooked sixpence beside a crooked stile;
      How can she be fair?
    And cried "What a good boy was I!"
    Bleak in a morning early;
WINTER HAS COME
    With rats and with dogs,
    That worried the cat,
    He took up his hat and he wished them good-night.
    She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;
    "Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,
    He met old Dame Trot with a basket of eggs,
    He knew a mouse was not a rat.
    Multiplication is vexation,
      As well as another body?
      And he was wond'rous wise,

    And their tongues moved whenever they spoke.
_A Apple Pie_
    And Betty's a lady, and wears a gold ring;
    Who'll dig his grave?
    Down came Pussy cat, and away Robin ran;
HARK, HARK! THE DOGS DO BARK
    A horse's head where his tail should be!
    A cat with her kittens came tumbling in.
    Windows made of black pudding and white,
    He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
    And began to belabour
    With silver buckles at his knee;
    The stick began to beat the dog;
    When he fell down, then down fell he.
    Till the pail was broke, and the milk ran on the ground.
    Dull November brings the blast;
      Which he vowed he would kill,
    Of a mouse in his life!
THE DIVISION OF LABOUR
A, B, C
    June brings tulips, lilies, roses,
    He put her in a pumpkin shell,
    Sat among the cinders,
      The rest they ran away.
      And called him Blue Bell;
    Good morrow to you, Valentine!
    A carrion crow sat on an oak,
NOTHING-AT-ALL
    Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow bone.
    She went to the undertaker's
    Some in her pockets, some in her sleeve,
      Touched the lady so fine,
      Else it was he.

    Tom with his pipe did play with such skill
THE LITTLE HUSBAND
    In a shower of rain;
      And shining in the sky,
    If you haven't got a ha'penny, God bless you.
    And his bullets they were made of lead, lead, lead.
    He often squeak'd and sometimes vi'lent,

    In a yellow petticoat, and a green gown.
    Very well, I thank you.
    And I'll get a wife as fast as I can;
    There was a navy went into Spain,
    As it fell out, they all fell in,
    There was an old woman, and what do you think?
    Shall have a little bit.

LITTLE BETTY BLUE
    The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts,
    That thou mayst go out and in;
    The skilful fisher goes not forth;
    The pig jumped over the stile;

    Who pulled her out?
    P was a Parson, and wore a Black Gown
    He ate the priest, and all the people!
    Brian O'Lin and his wife and wife's mother,
    Sukey, take it off again,
    I sold my cat and bought me a mouse;
    The ox began to drink the water;

    I washed my mammy's dishes,

      Or swim in one pond.
    That is the way to London town.
    I killed Cock Robin."
    She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye,
      Put on the pan, says Greedy Nan,
    And my fiddle I will bring."
MERRY ARE THE BELLS
    Thirteen, fourteen,
    Curly locks! curly locks! wilt thou be mine?
      But sit in a lap,
      For poor Cock Robin.
    Old Mother Hubbard
      The dog sat in a chair.
    Chirp, chirp, says the sparrow;
    How I wonder what you are!
    The cow jumped over the moon;
    But the water would not.
THE LITTLE MOUSE
    The king was in his counting-house
      With the chimney blown away.
    Thanks you for your tiny spark:
      Of busy lady Wind!
    And there will be enough
      Blowsey boys buble, oh,

    She gave me a diamond as big as my shoe.

    There was a little Guinea-Pig,
    Every fiddler, he had a fine fiddle,
    He never at that place did stay;
      To get him some tripe;

    And make butter anon,
      Oh, you're good kittens!
        Fly away, Jack!
    Would ride through the air
    I took up the beef bone and flung it at his head.
      And your wings of the silver so gray.
    Said he never saw the like behind.
    We are all in the dumps,

    He learned to play when he was young,
        Lay down and died;

      Into sweet Columbine.

    She'd be a better child by far
    May sing heigh-ho!
    This plaguy old woman could never keep quiet.
THE LITTLE GUINEA-PIG
    For want of a nail, the shoe was lost,
    And Charley loves good brandy;
    How many were there going to St. Ives?
    Buckle my shoe;
    And knows this is the fount of all learning.
    And then I think that we shall be
    I sold my calf, and I bought me a cat;
    He went to shoot a wild duck,
      all of a row.
    One said it was a ship,
    Mamma is a lady,
GEORGY PORGY
    Not one moment will I waste,
    That's what little girls are made of, made of.
      The cat has bit it quite in two.
    And there is an end of you.
    Come to your playfellows in the street.
    As the days grow longer
    There was an old woman tossed up in a basket
    The fox jumped up on a moonlight night;
    The king and queen did eat thereof,
THE CUCKOO
    |was an          |              |bit           |              |
    Determined to shoot this little Cock Sparrow.
    And then they run from hedge to hedge,
    Which finger did he bite?
    Simon Brodie had a cow;
    Daffy-down-dilly has come to town,
COCK-A-DOODLE-DO
      So she said to the dog:
    I went to Taffy's house, Taff was not at home;
    Then 'tis at the very best.
    And a merry sing-song, happy let us be!
    When he whipped them he made them dance
    Solomon Grundy,
      So she said:
    April brings the primrose sweet,
      And why may not Johnny love me?
      Going to the fair;
    And vowed he'd fight the frying-pan;
    "That may be so, but you don't come in."
    And bade him play the other tune--
    And when she awoke, she found it a joke,
    Then they began to sigh,
    Let us be kind to one another,
      To get him some beer;
    Maids in the kitchen;
    While the old woman finished sweeping the floor.
    And pretty maids
    And swore he would catch the fox in a trap;
    A frog he would a-wooing go,
    He let off his gun, but he fired too soon,
    Oh! brother Richard, the sun's very high!
    The fifth of November,
    His master came in,
    To match the other,
CURLY LOCKS
    Mary had a pretty bird,
    Lucy Locket
    Dance, little Baby, dance up high,
    Lived in a little house;
      And caught the goose soon,
    Little Tom Tinker's dog,
    Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree;
    My father he died, but I can't tell you how,
    My father he left me three acres of land,

    And all the night they hunted,
    And all the little ones said:
    I answered myself,
    Twice so merrily hopped she,
    The drake was a-swimming, with his curly tail;
    Robin, the Bobbin, the bouncing Ben,
    King Pippin built a fine new hall,
A MEDLEY
    But when he saw his eyes were out,
BLOW WIND BLOW
      We greatly fear
    How many hairs will make a wig?
    He tossed the dumpling at her head,
      And lay down on some hay;
    |joined          |              |kept          |              |
      No lark so blithe as he;
BOW-WOW, SAYS THE DOG
    Goosey, goosey, gander,
      Out of Scotland into France,
    Robin and Richard were two little men,
    Little girl, little girl, where have you been?
