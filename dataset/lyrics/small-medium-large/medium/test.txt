We'll go to the pagoda
Makes me come on like some heroine
I, I, I, I, I, how are you? how are you?
Tonight I'm goin' out, oh yeah Baby got it but baby want more
Down, down, and it's really comin', really comin',
Everybody wants to be reelin'

She is re-creation
There's no use faking it

He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,
Baby gotta move to the center of my pain
if you seek the kingdom come, come along
And free the hurricane, oh I go into the center of the airplane,
you eat the summer cannibals
Voices voices mesmerize
Break it up, and I want to go.
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble
Have I doubt when I'm alone
I feel upset

It's all so predestined. It's all such a game for my

Through the dorsal spine and down and around
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And straw-colored curls a-turning
Heard it on the radio, it's no good
I could hear the angel calling.
Like a log of Helen, is my pleasure. 
I was lost in the infinite sea.
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
spirit shed
Baby, baby, baby was a rock-and-roll nigger.
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up,
gone to where all treasures laid
and the air the viscous air
And we marched on toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers
And I have no guilt. 
They call me broken glass.
And the scalp inside is a scalp of

Set me free ...

Citizen ship, we got pain.

Ah, this is the era where everybody creates.
Holy the groaning saxophone, holy the bop apocalypse
Deep in the heart of your brain is a lever

And I awakened to the cry
Ribbon of life, it was nearing.
And the sky was open
lo I turned my neck toward home.
Vengeful aspects became suspect
Let's go waltzing on the water
he ascends into the wind
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move
My heart turned over and I crawled in.
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
If you called
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.
Humans are running, lavender room.

all will be well
I feel it feeling no pain
Name
And woe to the sun
What you pay for all these riches and fame
Send it deep in the heart of you
And the way you, the way your cloth looks, I like
Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money,
But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Guide my eyes and steps
Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
We just forged on
I was down in Georgia
Flag on a match head
This dead city longs to be free
forming equations but the questions are hard
And I know you got the feeling,
She was the victim of sweet suicide.
When, when will you be landing?
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee
Baby, I know our troubles will be gone.
Love in my heart.
But what can we say
She has the slow sensation that
I saw it floating in the river
It was a crying shame
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
he gave them his bread
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Isabel, my little one, take my hand. Time has come.
Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
I just don't know what to say to him. I just don't know.

Don't say nothing no
Oh da oh da oh da oh da oh da oh da

Peace to your brother, give and take peace,
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Total abandon, ooh, walla walla walla,
On boundaries over this world
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
yet fell beneath his luck
anything at all
Beyond the shelf
One of fallen glory
Save the need
Speak to me
Every night before I rest my head
It's not that you were just waving to me
I see it all before me:
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Motor city
a-walking a-walking
The bum's as holy as the seraphim
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,
he turned his back and his own people shot him
We have the power
thy moans

The night to exploit.
but yet you, you will cut someone down for their possessions
Here comes a stranger up on Ninth Avenue.
No longer presidents but prophets
Here I go and I don't know why,

I seek the nerves under your skin. 
Their breath for his breath
Some digital delay had obscured
pressed against my face
but the movie kept moving as planned
What is it, Father, I can tell what I like
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,
Lose your grip on the citizen ship,
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye aye.

Lift up your unto me.
As the 12th station
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
Go, go on, go like a dervish,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender?”
United children
I died
who stands guard for each other
for we three.
thinking those tears are yours
He throws back his head
That dreams itself
She connected with the inhaler
As I move thru seven levels
With none to laugh or criticize
A stage is like each bolt of wood, 
Madness overflowed
Were calling to me
Just a boy
Cast adrift from the citizen ship,
Speak to me heart
Wave thou art high
I have a winter's tale
In a holy war
and as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble
we expressed such sweet vows
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
And my senses newly opened
up there -- there is a sea
Oh I give my life for you.
and a strange way of breathing
In a room in Lebanon
The palace of answers with me, Marie
And everybody's a soldier
Here I go and I don't know why
But what can she say
They can't hurt you now,
the hungry earth
Frederick and Vitalie, savior dwells inside of thee.
When I don't get it, I get blue, blue
Assassin in prayer

we shoot our flint into the sun
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.”

You must rid yourself from these, these animal fixations

He sings of youth enraged
Rend the veil and we shall sail.
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
All those mint bushes around you
wherefore am I walking
Ah, there were tags all over my sleeve.
Eat the summer cannibals
Twice as blessed
it pours
All must not be art. some art we must disintegrate.
It's been a hard time
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
Isabella, all is glowing.
Lucky young boys
haunt and moan
be flung into space into another kind of grace
Holy the lone juggernaut, holy the vast lamb of the middle class
You ain't gonna need no, you ain't gonna need no little boat
Within the context of neo rock we must open up our eyes and seize and rend the veil of smoke which man calls order.
When my hair was cropped, I craved covering, 
And woe to the young
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.
And I commit my dream with you
or the color of their skin
Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon
Flower of creation.
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move
First, freedom
Hear it on the radio, hear it on the radio
You'd be amazed
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
Everywhere
And I know it's hard sometimes
Pretty little girl, everyone cried.
oh-oh oh oh
Angels appear
The beckoning sea
I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You.
Car stopped in a clearing,
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
What more can I give you to make this thing grow?
Sweet sweet revenge
Oh it's such a lovely game
Coming in the garden, got a conscious stream,
Deep inside of your ship.
Angels howling
(the veins)
Bread of your bread, ghost of your host,
make ravens of us all
Angel looks down at him and says, “Oh, pretty boy,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Ah, damn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn.
Here we are, Father, Lord, Holy Ghost,
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
With love we sleep
Baby was it in the closet.
Mother as I write the sun dissolves
Snow started falling,
And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy

And go Johnny go and do the watusi,
I impure thee, come explore me.
thy sighs
They were dreaming crazy dreams
Starting to fly.
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
yet I was free
Oh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin' gone
Citizen ship you got identity.
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
Women all standing with a shock on their faces.
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man
hearts will mend
Outside of society. [Repeat]
Who pray to return to salute
Let's go under again
To the one I love.
She is connecting with he
Give me your huddled masses
There was a wicked messenger
It was blood shining in the sun
Come on. Set me free
Who that person could possibly be
It was really great because there was about a billion people there
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky,
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing
Took it underground, M.C. borderline, up against the wall.
there's a cross on the road
cross on the main
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore.
not want to get involved in it all
And you will see us coming, V formation, through the sky.
I laid in the rushes the air was upon me
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,
captivate my dreams
Take vows inside of it.
before his time time shook
Oh, the cradle was our call. When it rocked we carried on.
It doesn't matter much to me
We were broke as well.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,
What is this wisdom, eyes of God,
I'm dancing barefoot
alive
Feel, see your blue lights are flashing,
Each dream of life I'll share with you
Grave visitations
It's decreed the people rule
Every night on sep'rate stars, before we go to sleep, we pray so breathlessly.
Armageddon, it's gotten
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
I won't wait around if I was you you
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi
seven steps
My heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
What is it, Father, in your eye,
I bolted the door and whispered oh well
Give me your wartorn and your
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
Where the dervish turns
and he fell on his knees
A light upon the swarm
In the form of shinin' valleys
We shut our eyes we stretch out our arms
Should I crawl defeated and gifted?
Oh, the way that I see him is the way I see myself.
I want another.
And the dust the endless dust
Beatin' and beatin' so outta time.
Baby want more
No line of death no boundaries
And they come and they call and they fall on the floor
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway.
he gave them his land
Baby calm down, better calm down,
And someday when you go
“No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,
descending into air
I am helium raven and this movie is mine,
Everybody got the feelin'
I was nothing. It didn't matter to me.
That's because of the sound [?]
We do not eat,
The eye is hollow
Wish for your brother.
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,
Went to my room, started to cry.
and send you a smile
Waiting underground [X6]
Ain't got a chance, sport, at fortune and fame.
the time has arrived
Come come come come back come back
A way I wish to know
On this night of wonder
How long how long will we make do
before the burning plane
Its energies are not for hire
And the people have the power
Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl
Where duty calls
fame is fleeting God is nigh
Talking communion ...
All that hearts desire
As the young thrush
to all eternity
God has granted
The world's roof was raging
Jesus Christ and Grandma, too.
Don't want sympathy.
Come come come come come come for me oh
like a Valentine
I opened my coat but he never came closer
Easter Sunday, we were walking.
I have to go
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner
Hal died in my arms
La, la la la la la landing.
Hal fell with the fever
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be
And war war is the battle cry
What's your name?
You and your alien arms
and herb and the true thorn and light)
And lay together truly bound
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?
And it's wild wild wild wild
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine
said hello friend
Don't forget who you are
Like a plague it covered everything
Oh I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,
beneath the pilgrim moon
but when it rains
Get yourself an electric guitar
You must release yourself
Not sentimental
and be Thee, be Thee.
What's the mad matter with the church chimes?
And I lit a match and the void went flash
When, when will you return?
Exploding dawn
Comin' in droves in from L.A.
(I remember when)
strong and happy be sure
in all that I saw
Recognize my face?
And my heart, my heart,
In a pretty red dress
Wisdom and compassion crushed
I will wash your feet
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,
And I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.
Holy the jazz bands, marijuana
Strange strange
"Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me."
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi
People have the power
Coming in the airport, coming in the sea,
We just had the quarrel that sent you away.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Lower the thing the skin of a cat
No other thing is luck like that
some seeking answers
On the citizen ship you got mem'ry.
Are we dreaming
Voice of the Swarm
The sphinx awakens
Spread its wings and fly away
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
oh-oh oh to you
The hands of he and the promise that she is blessed among women.
Her vessel, every woman is a vessel, is evasive, is aquatic.
Oh I'll send you a telegram
