I walk these streets famished
You see, that was my wife who you decided to What She courted me
And I'm drownin' in 'em
While you're asking for his blessin'
Wait
I hope that you burn
We needed money and guns and half a chance
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
She said "Be careful with that one, love
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
That's when Reynolds extorted me
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
Should we honor our treaty, King Louis' head
On whether to end the slave trade
And as for slandering Jefferson with talk of mistresses
Rise up, it's time to take a shot
With only the memories of when you were mine
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back (Hamilton) I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
I was seeking an accelerated course of study
I never had a group of friends before
Rise up, rise up, it's time to take a shot
I think your pants look hot
And no one shall make them afraid
How will Thomas Jefferson find his next mistresses? How dare you Yet still, people follow like lemmings
Every action's an act of creation
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers One last time George Washington's going home Teach 'em how to say goodbye George Washington's going home You and I George Washington's going home Going home George Washington's going home History has its eyes on you George Washington's going home We're gonna teach 'em how to say goodbye (teach 'em how to say goodbye) Teach 'em how To say goodbye To say goodbye (say goodbye) Say goodbye (say goodbye) One last time Seventeen seventy-six
For some kind of sign, and when you were mine
Helpless Look into your eyes
As I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
Then I'm willing to wait for it
How they perceive you You, you, you I'm erasing myself from the narrative
And the sky's the limit I'm helpless Down for the count
You have torn it all apart, I'm watching it
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
"You have married an Icarus
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
And we both know what we know I am not throwing away my shot
Down for the count
She said
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance In the eye of a hurricane
You all know
At home in this nation we've made
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
In the living room stressin'
Number six Leave a note for your next of kin
You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh
Let's raise a couple more to the revolution Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college Aaron Burr Give us a verse, drop some knowledge Good luck with that, you're takin' a stand
But just you wait What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton The issue on the table: a petition from a Quaker delegation in Philadelphia calling on Congress to end the African slave trade and abolish slavery, in all its forms. This petition was written and signed by Benjamin Franklin, it cannot go ignored. If this comes to a vote in Congress, what is the White House's position? Secretary Jefferson, you first. Tread lightly... Sir
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty Scratch that this is not a moment, it's the movement
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Burn You published the letters she wrote you
Will they know what you overcame?
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
It outlives me when I'm gone
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman Lafayette I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
He wastes no time Time
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
And there's a million things I haven't done
The world has no right to my heart
What's he gonna do on the bench?
Ship that was New York bound I wrote my way out of hell
Until eighteen-oh-eight to debate
So? The people won't know what we know Burr
Wait till the 1800's, and their population doubles
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
New York City
Plantation states are packed with promise makers
And I'm drownin' in 'em Where are you taking me?
He woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm (ooh)
To you (ooh)
Between the sinners and the saints
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent Number eight Your last chance to negotiate
And we break
A land of the free? No, it's not, it's hypocrisy
My name is Alexander Hamilton
Summon all the courage you require
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
You and I No, sir, why I wanna talk about neutrality Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time I want to warn against partisan fighting But Pick up a pen, start writing
I am an original Wait for it
Enragin' em
Those redcoats don't want it with me
Whose descendants will curse our names when we're safe in our graves
With my, shot Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
He will do what it takes to survive" You and your words flooded my senses
We're through (ooh)
In New York you can be a new man Just you wait Alexander Hamilton We are waiting in the wings for you You could never back down
Wait for it I'm not falling behind or running late Wait for it
Overwhelm them with honesty This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir? That depends, who's asking? Oh, sure, sir
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
Onarchy how you say, how you say, anarchy?
If they apologize, no need for further action Number two If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned Number three
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
This is the stain on our soul and democracy
Have another shot Geniuses, lower your voices
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
I'm gonna take a shot But we'll never be truly free
That was agreed upon
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets (wow) No more sex, pour me another brew, son
Rise up, take a shot, shot, shot
I am lying in wait Wait
Whisper, yo, this one's mine My sister made her way across the room to you (ooh)
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Yo, I'm John Lauren's in the place to be
There's a difference, frankly
Let's hope the next generation thinks of something better I saved every letter you wrote me
He takes and he takes and he takes
I'm dying inside, as
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
That is the final compromise we made Sir wait- But for a second let us say that we can legislate
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Where do we draw the line So quick witted Alas, I admit it I bet you were quite a lawyer My defendants got acquitted Yeah, well, someone oughta remind you What You're nothing without Washington behind you Hamilton Daddy's calling In the eye of a hurricane
I mean Hamilton No one has more resilience
That my country will
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
Graduate in two, then join the revolution he looked at me like I was stupid I'm not stupid So how'd you do it, how'd you graduate so fast? It was my parent's dying wish before they passed You're an orphan, of course I'm an orphan
Then you walked in and my heart went boom
I shall also carry with me The hope
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
What time is it? Show time Like I said Show time, show time
And I'm not throwing away my shot
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop
When are these colonies gonna rise up? Rise up
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
Where I come from some get half as many
Let's take a break tonight
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission And the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation
And then we'll teach them how to say goodbye
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Sir, even you, you have hundreds of slaves
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Mister Madison
I have soldiers who will yield for you
Of that year, we'll ban importation handling the worst
And say that we are powerless to stop it, can you not foresee?
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
You'll never feel so Eliza I've never felt so My life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it I do I do I do I do Down for the count
I thought you were mine Do you know what Angelica said
Only a promise that we'd lend a hand
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait (history has its eyes on you) I'll write my way out
You wine
Your sentences left me defenseless
In the pockets of people like me, down on their luck
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me They passed a plate around
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Number one The challenge, demand satisfaction
Whoa, whoa, whoa come on Come on, let's go
And if there's a reason
In New York, you can be a new man Helpless Mister Vice President
Drop and burn 'em up and scatter their remains, I'm Lafayette Watch me engagin' em, escapin' em
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
But then he shakes your hand and says
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Boy you got me
He knows nothing of loyalty
Is it like a beat without a melody?
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Wrote everything down far as I could see
Have your seconds meet face to face Negotiate a peace Or negotiate a time and place This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Wait I saved every letter you wrote me
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set
Limit I'm
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
I wrote financial systems into existence
When's it gonna get me?
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
Senator Burr
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
Uh do whatever you want, I'm super dead Enough, Hamilton is right Mister President We're too fragile to start another fight But sir, do we not fight for freedom Sure, when the French figure out who's gonna lead 'em The people are leading The people are rioting
I am the A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R we are meant to be A colony that runs independently
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Wait Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb Climb
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
A yellow sky I was twelve when my mother died
And I'm tryin' not to cry
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir When we were on death's door, when we were needy
If you talk, you're gonna get shot Burr, check what we got
I have been looking for you I'm getting nervous Sir, I heard your name at Princeton
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said come again Ay, lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
Time
Not throwing away my shot Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
All your hemming and hawing, while you're hee-hawing with Sally Hemings That's enough Well you asked how I feel
We're gonna teach 'em how to say
I paid him quarterly
She was holding me
In New York, you can be a new man
Laurens, I like you a lot
I wrote my way out
I'm willing to wait for it My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya My mother was a genius My father commanded respect When they died they left no instructions
Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And we make our mistakes
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
They'll be safe in the nation we've made
Do you know what Angelica said
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
A yellow sky When I was seventeen a hurricane
And whether or not you want it, guys
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw? No one else was in the room where it happened Is that a yes? Um, yes Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
'Cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
So back to Africa or do they get a separate state?
In which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking
You sleep in your office instead
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
Not throwing away my shot Seventeen seventy-six
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Burn
When she read what you'd done?
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
I'll remind you that he is not Secretary of State
Wait for it I am inimitable
Do you realize the precious time these legislators wasted?
How do I know you won't use this against me
We need to handle our financial situation
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa
'Cause I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette
When so many have died
Wait for it I am the one thing in life I can control Wait for it
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
The only person you have to convince is me
Just a legacy to protect Death doesn't discriminate
To subjugate, dehumanize a race, call 'em property
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart
Yes, I have reasons for shame
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
That buys us time and assuages fear
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him Ha
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat
The people will hear from me
The unrest in France will lead to onarchy?
It's a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
The world seemed to burn
I promise that I'll make y'all proud Let's get this guy in front of a crowd I am not throwing away my shot
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation Ooh Hey, and if ya don't know, now ya know, Mister President Thank you, Secretary Jefferson Secretary Hamilton, your response You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
Pray that hell or heaven lets you in Seven Confess your sins
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow And I am not throwing away my shot
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean Hamilton Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
It's a pleasure to meet you Schuyler? My sister Thank you for all your service If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it I'll leave you to it One week later I'm writin' a letter nightly
I gotta holler just to be heard
He has nothing to lose Lose
I may have punched him it's a blur, sir
Total strangers
'Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
But just you wait What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine It's the Ten Duel Commandments It's the Ten Duel Commandments
In New York you can be a new man In New York you can be a new man
And I'm not throwing away my shot We're gonna rise up (time to take a shot)
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
One last time
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
When so many have tried
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Climb
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
Gentlemen, let's go
I didn't drown
Not throwing away my shot How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility You have him turn around so he can have deniability Five Duel before the sun is in the sky Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart
After forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
We'll see where we land (boo) Burr, the revolution's imminent, what do you stall for? If you stand for nothing Burr, what'll you fall for? Oh, who are you oh, who are you oh, who are you?
You forfeit the place in our bed
I'm about to change your life Then by all means, lead the way Elizabeth Schuyler
From the moment I read them, I knew you were mine
Or do we stay out of it, remember
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit I'm willing to wait for it I'm willing to wait for it Life doesn't discriminate
And if we get this right
By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter
It takes and it takes and it takes We rise and we fall
In 1784, I tried to float banning slavery in the West
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
We rise and we fall
Not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors
Between the sinners
A moment alone in the shade
We're gonna rise up (time to take a shot)
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
And dine
It takes and it takes and it takes
I'm Lafayette I go to France for more funds Lafayette I come back with more Guns
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous? Okay, so we're doin' this Number nine Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
Will they know you rewrote your game?
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Seventeen ninety-one Is that what you have, are you done?
Tell the king casse-toi
Unanimous emancipation, freedom reigns, and yes, it's great
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on the bow of a ship headed for a new land
I wanna talk about what I have learned
I'm willing to wait for it Wait for it
Wait Hey hey hey hey (ohh, I do I do I do I)
He has flown too close to the sun" You and your words, obsessed with your legacy
My father's stone-faced
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
You forfeit all rights to my heart
I am unconscious of intentional error
Whoa, whoa, whoa said, to the rooftops
And ships
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
I don't pretend to know the answer, but the question is real If I may, Mr. President?
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts To a Mister James Reynolds way back in
Check it again against your list n' see consistency
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need I know Hamilton Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Be true (ooh)
And the world is gonna know your name
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Your sentences border on senseless
He handles the financials? You punched the bursar? Yes, I wanted to do what you did
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning You're kidding I need a favor Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for this behavior Shh, talk less I'll use the press
And we keep loving anyway
Would rather not have this debate
And I'm drownin' in 'em I'm helpless Look into your eyes
In the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of good laws
The faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
Wait for it I'm not standing still
Oh, who is this kid, what's he gonna do? Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
Theodosia, she's mine Love doesn't discriminate
My father makes his way across the room
But we can't address the question if we do not have an answer Is it my turn? Good
He changes the game
I'll tell the North that on January 1st
I'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him I need you to draft an address Yes, he resigned, you can finally speak your mind No, he's stepping down so he can run for President Ha, good luck defeating you, sir I'm stepping down, I'm not running for President I'm sorry, what One last time
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (write everything down, far as I can see)
Do you really wanna- Do you really wanna have that conversation? No Madison, execute your plan to the letter
And the sky's the
Are my answers to your satisfaction? My God
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
Who's the best, c'est moi Brrrah, brraaah I am Hercules Mulligan
I know the action in the street is excitin'
Tell 'em where you been
We laugh and we cry
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
Then we could prove that we're worth more than anyone bargained for Can I buy you a drink?
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
Then I'm willin' to Wait for it
And I'm not throwing away my shot I am not throwing away my shot
Yo
I'm burning the memories
And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence impoverished,
My notion didn't get a single vote
You said you were mine
Then count One two three four Five six seven eight nine Number Ten paces Fire How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Would you like to take it out and ask it
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
You spit, I'm 'a sit
See if you can spot him Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom His enemies destroyed his rep America forgot him We fought with him Me, I died for him Me, I trusted him Me, I loved him And me, I'm the damn fool that shot him There's a million things I haven't done
There is quiet
Helpless
And before he was your friend, he was mine
I couldn't seem to die Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (I'll write my way out)
I wrote my way to revolution
You built cathedrals
Every burden, every disadvantage
For a sordid fee
How will the south find labor for its businesses?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm helpless
Climb He has something to prove
Get your education, don't forget from whence you came
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
Tryin' to reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable
The world has no place in our bed
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' I'm through (ooh)
I'm past patiently waitin' I'm passionatelymashin' every expectation
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position Though 'virtue' is not a word I'd apply to this situation
And introduce a notion never to discuss this again Mr President! Hamilton, if we support emancipation
And I'm not throwing away my shot Everybody sing
I'm helpless Look into your eyes
One last time One last time Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration
Let's take this moment to establish a precedent
That the states have to wait
Lose
God, I wish there was a war
You and I Mister President, they will say you're weak No, they will see we're strong Your position is so unique So I'll use it to move them along Why do you have to say goodbye If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
We cannot cure prejudice or righteous, desperate hate
Redcoats redder with bloodstains Lafayette And I'm never gonna stop until I make 'em
Goodbye
He plays and he raises the stakes
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside voice saying
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
I wanna give you a word of warning Sir, I don't know what you heard
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
And the sky's the limit
That would be nice While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Watching it burn
Desperate to rise above his station
And that
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Way I can protect my legacy Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait The Reynolds Pamphlet Mister President, you asked to see me I know you're busy What do you need, sir Sir
An immigrant embezzling our government funds I can almost see the headline, your career is done
And the saints
To say goodbye
You've got to be carefully taught
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick And Alex got better but his mother went quick Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Troops are waiting in the field for you
It's time to take a shot I dream of life without a monarchy
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine Grab my sister, and
I couldn't seem to die I wrote my way out
Enter me, he says in parentheses Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
