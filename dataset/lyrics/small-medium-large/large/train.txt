No question is unresolved
Hand 2 hand (hand 2 hand)
But I can't love U (I can't love U)
If your man ain't no good

Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Hey, when I was your man

Such a double drag
Life is precious baby, love is so rare
Then I want u 2 kiss me until I make u stop
Nothing that will break us apart
I flash upon my whole life just-a-steady wishin' (live 4 love)
Funny but it seems that you're alone like me
Pardon me 4 thinking, but there's something under my hair
'Cause I'm sick and tired of being alone

Giddy up
But something about the clouds and her mixed
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
On a watered-down tip
All of my cool attitude U took
All the non-believers better fear me
I'd rather do U after school like some homework
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
I want U in the worst way.
Promise to see jesus in the morning light
A road that he's afraid 2 walk on his own (I'm at that road)

I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
Don't stop, don't stop

Annie Christian was a whore always looking for some fun
Everybody in this room

Cuz u got the burnin' desire
That the love we make is really pretty rude
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
From dusk till dawn
Every schoolboy's fanstasy she was
Baby can you stand the pain
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
If I was your girlfriend, would U tell me?
Baby, so dark
Every time the other comes near
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun
"I like 'em proud"
[Every man I'll injure]
All the boys, grab a girl, get down on the floor
Where?
We need love & honesty, peace & harmony
Seems 2 happen 2 me each and every time we make love
I hope our baby has eyes just like yours
How could I forget that U are the rule
U can always see the sun, day or night
Hot thing, looking 4 big fun
Why you wanna treat me so bad?
So I won't waste your time
The bed started shakin', I don't know who to blame
Is my character enough 2 be
One - Oh Daddy
Girl, I gotta always have you in my ear
Girl, I'll take u to a movie show, we can sit in the back
4teen years and tears I've longed 2 sing my song
Take a chance
And you're talking to someone else
Like a strawberry (Come), chocolate
U have to, you gotta go
Cuz 2 night I'm, 2 night I'm gonna be your fantasy!
We gonna dance every dance
Shall we go back? Let's go
I just want your extra time and your
There are over 500 experiences 2 choose from
Everybody shake. (shake, shake, shake)

And love, it isn't love until it's past
Oh Cindy C
So like I saw u from across the room, and (maybe we can stay in touch)

I'm testing (we can funk) positive and I'll pee some more
It don't mean your rep cuz U kiss in a restaurant
Controversy
Mama, are u listening?
Let me see u dance
Turning in your body's, psyche, dial a perfume that u like,
I'm talkin' about U and me
By my animal-like persistence
Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday, (don't matter)
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door
Why else would a woman wanna treat a man so bad?
The road u chose 2 walk in this life (the road u choose 2 walk in this life)
Once upon a time in the land of Sinaplenty
I never would've thought that this would happen
And if she did - I wouldn't care. Let's ball
Baby, baby, when I look at you
This 1's 4 the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy -
Look 4 the purple banana
There it is
Gotta keep it that way
Maybe it's the only way
Hurt me
I'm gonna kick your super natural ass!
More than, more than your mother
Said I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Sex (sex), romance (romance)
There won't be no more (no tears)
One day all 7 will die
We ain't leavin' 'til they (oh daddy)
I love U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
Oh stella, I know u came alone
(I wish there was no black and white)
I can't help it - like a honey 2 a bee -
The sun will shine upon u one day
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what silence looks like
U must have been a virgin
Damn u
Now that U got it, let's do the twist
2 commit the crimes of passion
The things that you do to me
And I just wanna tell U that I
Don't u want 2 play with me? (Yes)
Life can be so nice. A wonderful world, paradise
Round and round we go. Round and round we go.
Everybody's looking 4
Tryin' 2 deal with all your fears
Still I keep Vicki waiting...
I think U and I got a (strange relationship)
The pop seem, hmmm, a little overrated
I'm just-a rock hard in a funky place
Baby I could never steal you from another
I betcha thatcha never knew that in my dreams you are the star
U're just 2 mean
Love is God, God is love
He's looking 4 an angel to hold him 'til the morning light
Ha, I don't care
Hey, check it all out
Talk, guitar, talk
If there's life after, we will see
Batman
Naked in a cadillac, I'll jack u off
A Love that reaffirms that we R not alone
(Cindy C)
Fighting one another, (we sacrifice) (don't say it preacher)
Do u really mean it when u cry,
'cause I did it in the name of Jesus Christ
How she know me when. Damn, here we go again (what he say?)
[I'll wrap my legs around U]
Over your climax and over mine,
Everybody always told me
Attempt 2 roast and even boast about (what)
Oh baby, your place or mine?
U know, U know, I'm busy, 2 scizzy
God shed his grace on thee
But I could never take the place of your man
Just like u're supposed 2 do (...speak english...)
(Every man's journey)
With a bucket filled with squirreled meat
I'm talkin' 'bout the Detroit crawl
Come and see
"I ain't got time to play."
Love is more important than sex.
Next time I'll do it sooner
The New Power Generation has just taken control
U will go before me
Shall I go in a circle like the merry-go-round
Could u kiss 3 times with your dress upside
Get me outta here - I feel I'm gonna die
Joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again,
Before I tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, bang, all over u
We might have a little talk!
Pimps and thangs like 2 hang outside and cuss for kicks
((Frankie, how do u know...))
Party, got to party down, baby
Keep the blood flowing down 2 your feet
Ow! Bang, b-b-bang, bang
Why don't u leave motherfuckers alone? [slowed down to about 2 rpm,says]
Must I become naked? No image at all?
It's just that easy if u want it 2 be
So pump the big noise, c'mon in the house...
Let's go crazy
[Translated: The children who lie don't go to paradise]
Oh, darling, I can almost taste the wetness between your...
When the blood of my love outraces
If u really really want to be a star
Will anybody see the dawn
I need a lover, a lover, I need a...right now.
I'm goin' home.
4 we come regardless
Please, baby, don't say no
Oh, whatever's in your kiss
I only pray that when U dream, I'm the 1 U dream of
And I'm thinkin' about some of that
Y'all ain't got it together
Cuzzin' when Spooky say dead, U better say died
A B C D E F H I love U
Cuz sugar, U know U're just the kind of lover
But that's alright, cuz in my possession, there's a signed confession
Are your smiles, are your smiles 4 me?
Shy (Shy)
He said it wasn't cool
You married me instead
Sometimes I feel so bad
All of the questions in my life will be answered
A train is leaving all day
If u're tired of the masturbater
G-G-Gimme the beat now (Face the music)
For the funkiest band in the land and don't forget
Do it all over again, do it all over again
I want 2 meet U (meet U), kiss U (kiss U),
(Up and down, just like a seesaw) ((back and forth))
(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)
I think U want me to (beep) inside of U
So how u wanna be done? (how u wanna be done?)
The one who will listen when all others will not. (all others will not)
Everybody sing this song now, ooh (ooh), alright (alright),
Woke up the next morning
A happy boy or a girl
U and me a starring in a movie called "Amour"
Don't understand why u (hurt me in the dark)
(damn u)
Ah hear me baby, hear me baby
Until u get 2 higher ground
(God created woman) (soul)
When I decide which road 2 choose
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Better keep it greasy
La la la la la
Dorothy laughed
Just leave me
Make a wish on every wave
Arm light on
Baby, u blow my mind
No regrets, no sorrow - I'm goin' back 2morrow 2 make sure he's dead
What's the matter with me, Cindy? (Nothing)
Say, we need to get wild again like it was when we first met
Gett off - 23 positions in a 1 night stand
(We gotta break it on down, down, down)
"Hi, Bruce Wayne"
If U just open your eyes (still would stand all time)
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
So he left u for another fool
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line (Get in line!)
I can make it real good (so good)
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
Don't U baby?
Lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter
I could be guilty 4 my honesty, all right
Ooh baby, don't U wanna be alone 2night?
Hey yeah, What time it is, love machine
I'm not a man
It speaks of profound inner peace
...it was the same thing that made Eve take the 1st bite
Everybodys looking 4 love
if you're coming home at all
(Get on the mike...)
But she looked so pretty
Pack the house then try 2 sing,
And everybody cried
Body gets so weak I can hardly stand
'Twas like thunder (oh) all thru the night (all through)
I would rather drink 6 razor blades
(do you wanna, do you wanna, bath)
Shoo be doo wa wa, dead on it
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
Love & honesty, peace & harmony
Pretty thing keeps worrying about keeping on her feet
A smile beneath her nose
We're all excited
(the one that was standin')
That I wanna love more
(lalalalalalala play, laugh in the sunshine)
They don't want anything else (no they don't)
Vanity 6 is so sweet
Let your feelings out, love is there
"Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'cause I know
About playing guitar
I think I'm gonna like this
If u go there once u
Closer 2 your higher self
Call People magazine, Rolling Stone
What I'm going to do
Right in the ground
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life (U are my saviour)
Oh my God, there I go
They rather see u on the run push
And night and day would run together, and all things would b fine
U ask me if I love U, it's automatic
As I step to the mic and lend a hand (oh daddy)
Oh yes
Everybody's looking 4 love
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
When the day turns into the last day of all time
And try my best 2 never get bored
Come on and touch it, I know U will love it
I can see the curtain wrestled from the wall
{do that girl, do that girl}
Cuz I want the main thing (continental)
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?
Some of U may not know this
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
Party up

There!
OK so like first I'll start by telling U how

Play
When I need someone 2 talk 2, u're not around
Can I fuck U baby?
Uno para todos, y todos para uno [One 4 all and all 4 one]
Color U peach and black
A body like yours
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Cuz once your love has gone away
But if U ain't hip 2 the rare house quake:
Do U wanna play with me?
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
But cha know what?
I wonder you
with tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes)
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunchbox
That's when it all up and flies away
I'm drownin' baby, in my love foy you
Hallowed be thy name
1-2-3-4!
I got good and plenty cards
(we-we-we sacrifice)
Uh, slammin'
It's in your eyes what can I say
Understand, understand that I love U
It was 10:35 on a lonely friday night
But u'd probably say that I was a liar
If U change your mind, U can reach me on your video phone
No shouting
Up and down, up and down, on the beat y'all
New Power Generation style
I say, sitting idle in our boat while everyone else is down the stream
Melody Cool...
(time 2 do the grind)
Girls and boys love God above
You've got a river that takes away my pain
that can do the duty in your bed, yeah
Why can't we walk on two?" (say, can't nobody)
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Go crazy - punch a higher floor
Whenever we're not close to one another
Before the police come
I'll do anything you want
U can set your mind free, yeah
I only want U 2 have some fun
What kind of boy would dis, a list, as long as his-tory itself
The young so educated they never grow old
Hey now, maybe we can find a good reason
No, damn it! Turn the music back up!
U're such a bombshell
And the glory forever and ever
U and I could fly away, fly away."
I only want to lay you down
To a castle in the valley
Then I'd make u understand
But I could tell when she kissed me
If u think that I can't do the do (yeah papa)

vous etes tres belle (vous etes tres belle, mama)
Pero antes un mensaje de nuestros auspiciadores
I hate U because I love U

Say what? Oh yeah?
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
"Ever dance with the devil in the pale moon light?"
Come back Nikki, come back

I'll pay the usual fee
When 2 R in love
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely
Talk 2 me baby, tell me how u wanna be done
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Let's go (dance)
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right

From now on, 4 U I shall be wild
U're bumpin' dentures 2 be cocksure
Sign up on the dotted line
I won' stop until the morning light
Yes - if U want this feeling called love
And all good things, they say, never last
In baby who knows how long
Come bathe with me
How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve (Gett off)
Come 2 the park
Oh, Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
Terminal condition of the heart
Why do special women make me cry?
Keep the children free
Look so tough, baby
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
I'm sorry.
A lover
We don't don't mean 2 take up yo time (joy around the corner)
Would that be cool?
They all know the words but the music is doomed
This feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)
Do I believe in me?
keep singin' y'all
That years after the contract you should
Japanese say 1 time ooh (ooh), alright (alright),
I don't wanna hurt you, baby
What's this strange relationship?
But just keep your eye on my hips
"Have you ever heard of the healing power of laughter?"
Oh, love, Love, oh Love if U would just please give us a sign
Oops, then there goes your clout
Place it like that 2 open up the door
(Be glad that U r free)
There is a future (a future worth fighting 4)
(Oh Cindy C, Oh Cindy C, Oh Cindy C, Oh Cindy C)
No man, u don't want me on the mike (don't stop until u go)
I knew a girl named Nikki
When this solo's through, Jerome? Morris?

I reckon it's the result of an onslaught of separatist rookies
Or the raindrops in your hair
No more, no more (No more will U cry)

Spirits rise and spirits fall

Put me on the street and make me blue
So I danced
You don't have to watch Dynasty
Now's the time (now's the time) 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)

Is the poverty bringing U down?
Turn it out
I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool

Round and round.
Would our Lord be happy if He came 2 day?
Release it. Yes.

Even if I wasn't thirsty,
Stop the music baby, automatic fool

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Delirious)
Come, come, come on, release it
2 your lovely face
I guess I should've closed my eyes
(gimme the bass, gimme the bass, one time)
There is no shore
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Lay back and let the feelings show
For a love like ours is never out of season
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Coming
It's gonna be a beautiful night (just the drums, just the drum -- Bobby)
Pump 'em and funk 'em, pump 'em and funk 'em
Out of time
Excuse my savoir faire,
Just once will you talk to me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Ready or not, here I come
Why are you so arrogant?
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Hey, I ain't got no money
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
I'm gonna show you how
In the event there is overexcitement
"I like..."

Put your head on the block, somebody say ABSCAM
Stupid look on my face
Go... yeah yeah
All excited then u go home.
Tell me do u like what u hear?
Come on baby. Let's go... crazy"
Right there
Heavy feather, flicka nipple
If we bathe in each other's hips(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
Baby, maybe if you're good girl
I pay the rent in this raggedy motherfucker
There's a bass guitar in this
The cards have always been stacked against us (live 4 love)
This is the new romance
I don't wanna sweat
Tell me how many young brothers must die
Every single 1 of us knows some kind of pain
We live in a world overrun by tourists
Listen (oh girl, I'm fallin')
My-my-my-my-my-my woman
Baby I don't care I would rip out my hair
Anything U've ever dreamed of
Let's get out of here (yeah)

Louder, say it (housequake)
Who's horns are these blowing? Mine.
Must be something in the water they drink
Shake! (shake on it... for me)
Computer blue

She walked in through the out door, out door
You're just 2 much 2 take
Girl, you know what I need

Whatever come 4 and after me is yin yang
See all my critics wastin' time
U know I didn't even care
She was standin' by the bar
Shall we go back? (Yeah!)
Oooo - Thunder

She got beat 4 some clothes and her rep
We need a power structure that breeds production
Must be something in the water U drink

Your body's what I'm all about
Bambi, I know what you need
U got the horn so why don't u blow it (Go on and blow it)
Say, let's pretend we're married and go all night
Don't do this 2 me (Must be something in the water U drink)
Baby you got 2 stop
Then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
I wanna do IT baby every day, all right
So that's why U see they call me Melody Cool (Melody, Melody Cool, Melody)
I wanna fuck you so bad it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?
It makes me feel so bad
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
It's time 4 jazz 2 die
(Yes, you are)
We gonna play in the sunshine
Since when did u have a job?
A feeling of self-worth (everybody's looking)
I would do 2 your head
I know that's not the way 2 be
Revolutionary rock and roll
Hmmm...Just conversate (Yeah!)
And forgive him
A world of never ending happiness
I just hate 2 see an erection go 2 waste
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Sing it! (star)
But U see when crime is your only love
Some say a man ain't happy
When I say that I'm in love mama (mama, mama)
Say U're sorry if U wanna but it's all in vain
U go 4 me and I come again
Anna Stesia come 2 me
U could cut off all your hair, I don't think they'd care - in New York
But I, I came on your wedding gown
When a rocket blows
Will U accept my tears 2 pay the fare?
Walkin' down this road, (we sacrifice)
Did u ever stop 2 wonder
In the middle of the night (Oh, Cindy C)
Purplelectricity whenever our bodies touch
(La da da da da da)
Or maybe I'm just too naive
I don't wanna die
Or just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers
(I know) I know - there is a heaven and a hell
The electric chair
And I'm here 2 rock your world
What? (shake! shake!)
[crowd noise same as for "Alphabet Street"]
(Long live the New Power Generation)
of life
Everything will be alright
[Feet stompin'!]
Sexe et repos
I'm fallin' baby, deeper every day
Honey, we can't last (we can't last)
When I do, there won't be no more (confusion)
Then he screamed at baby twice 4 throwin' rocks at passin' cars
Closer 2 heaven (Maybe) closer 2 God (closer to God)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting 4.
Forever until my love is through, I, I will love you
Why is age more than a number when it comes 2 love?
Go on girl
Let's forget about the time (time)
Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
(Whoa) [x4 in BG]
Brother steady talkin' while (steady, steady, steady)
She took me to her castle
Hurry before it's 2 late
This feelin'
U will want 2 hear it every day
Yeah, if u want 2 go 4 or 5, baby that's alright with me
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
In my daddy's car
What's he do for a living?
Keep the blood flowin' down 2 your feet
Work it down 2 the ground, say (Party)
It will be the same one that will leave your broke ass in a ditch (Ditch)
Never, ever go by the letter (Never ever)
Honey, u danced so hard I smelled your perfume, (maybe we can stay in touch)
Trust - who do ya?
And a, there will be no death 4 with every breath
Lead line (Face the music)
U said u were funky, c'mon
Wait, I want ya with me
But this time it's all right
"Oh - that's nice"
(Kick it)
Trouble winds r blowin', I'm growin' cold
One day they just got to understand (Melody)
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Yeah, homey, kick it just like that (yeah)
Alright, let's dance.
The flesh is weak and the spirit is strong
But different than the day before
I ain't fuckin' just 4 kicks, no
Take me away!
I go 2 the max
I'd rather see yourself checkin' ass up 2 bat 4 another swing
Pardon me 4 breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
Lady - I'm so lonely
I knew that we could slide
Say papa, I think I wanna dance
And you say, "What have I got to lose?"
They could contemplate the entire universe
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
Dream
Baby, can't see a damn thing out my window it's so dark (so dark)
You let all my friends come over and meet
Maybe I'll kiss u some wild special way
Can U hear me, babe?
Temptation
There remained an empty space within my bed
Until you're dying to have me 4 your own.
If U didn't come 2 party,
It's gonna be lonely
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
There's no telling how long I'd last.
This feeling is too strong, make me wait too long
When we be makin' love
I don't give a damn about the others
And a beetle and a mouse
If you're out there, baby, please come to me
2 place on the table (table)
Do you wanna play?
What's yours, baby?
I can wrap my legs around U girl
I need somebody to hold on to baby
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys
U've been chosen, P
Neighbors just shine it on

Only we can change the world
Nor where he was going
(Here's a reason why)
New world needs spiritually
Do me baby
I can't help thinkin' about cha
Shakin' that ass
So just put your foot on the gas - let's drive
A whiz at math and all that shit (how 'bout that?)
Just lay back and dream
Love - U cannot imagine
Lips... (mama, girls and boys)
Like a wildcat, Martha, in a celibate rage
Ooh, I can't hold it
(push) I push (push, push, hey)
Just when u think u've got more than enough
Uptown
I can see the castle
You were so fine (so fine)
When I blow that mind baby
Now raise your right hand
Words intended 2 belittle or dismay?
She's a freaked out,

U sure eat enought of them motherfuckers
In your arms, c'mon baby

(summer she is sweet)
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night
Stand Up, Organize

The feeling last 4-ever
It's just all I think about U
There lived a king who didn't deserve 2 be
All lies, no truth
There's something about the things you do
Want 2 sell, sell, sell (75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!)
Following him whenever he's with you
Somebody help me sing it now
To a very careful man like me
Listen 2 me people, I got a story to tell
{Go Morris chanted 16 times over}
Better than a trip (Morning glories never cry)
The former is red, white, and blue
I'll be around doing what you what me to
You don't have to be rich
Baby scam water ripple
Every one of the stallions in your pack - that's when
The steps U take are no easy road (the steps you take are no easy road)
She only said the words again and it started to rain (rain, rain, rain)
It's gonna be a beautiful night (verse, clap your hands)
With love, sincerity and deepest care
The love of a boy, the love of a girl
Tell me what you're singin', baby say (Party)
The blood is real good if u drink it real fast
Would U let me wash your hair
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than u
(You said I could)
Hello?

(U gotta rock this mother)
Don't make me chase you
I was sure heaven marked the deck
Let me have a debt worth winning,
How can you do this to me
Girl I wanna turn it on turn it on turn it on every night
('I'll say a prayer 4 U 2')
I knew you would be trouble, (trouble, trouble)
U've got 2 try my new funk
Fair 2 partly crazy, deep down we're all the same
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Never have I wanted to till now
What she told me then got me so hot
Sometimes a pistol takes the place of her body
Walk faster sweet baby (walk faster)
Drippin' all over U like a ball of wax, relax and let go!
"U don't, now die!"
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand
Fuck that talk Morris
Shake! Oh lord. U got 2 shake something.
They can have u, I'll have your love in the end
If the song we're singing truely is the best
My God was worried 'til he heard me sing
Underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, U're gonna miss me
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
(not yet Bonnie)
That's got a reason and frees the mind (Yeah)
Good times were rolling
Acting out a whim is only good
It'll be the only word that's heard
U'd be better off cheatin' than tryin'
Round and Round.
Of penetration (let alone the act)
I want to be your fantasy
Now, my Lord I understand
Ooh, best night I ever had

Whenever you say that you can't -

Sexuality is all u'll ever need

But on the 7th day he made me
You're just a sinner I am told
Sex - it's not that type of party
Break it down, break it down
I love U [x3]
I put her on the back of my bike
You belong to Prince (you belong to Prince)
Come on baby, get up, get up, get up, get up
Funky electric mama with double cups
That juggle 17
Everybody on this earth has got a vice
Dance on, dance on
Just thinkin' about all we could do
Can't run from the revelation, no (Party)
1 day I'll make a play and she will say ok
When half a chance is all I get if I get a chance at all
Come on then
Shake! Shake. U gotta shake something.
Talking 2 no one in particular, they say "the baddest I am tonight"
Will U cry, cry, cry, cry (Here's a reason why)
Knew I got 2 getcha, got 2 getcha, before u're all gone.
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a Limousine
Con-con-continental
Then give me the electric chair
(Face Face Face Face Face)
I can't stop, u know I love it a lot,
I turned on my radio 2 hear some music play
I need the green three sheets.
Put your love down there when u wanna get shot
2 night we video...
Music late, nothing great (Music late, nothing great)
(sac-sacrifice)
'Cuz I don't wanna blow it
Oh, what a shame.
This is gonna be the one (alright, Paris, we gonna see how)
But when I woke up this mornin'
What if I called U silly names
Would U let me in?
Set your mind free
It's gonna be so hard 2 hear my voice
Next beat kickin' the jughead (jughead)
Why must we play this game?
She says conversation's better than being lonely
Just let yourself go - don't put up a fight
Let me take a bite
"Mind if I turn on the radio?"
I truly adore U (darlin')
'cause we're going 2 do it all night long
(Mmm)
Yeah, everybody's got a bomb,
I'm fallin' in love
Cuz I'm stripped down, It's all fun and games
"Oh, my favorite song" she said
We're gonna show U what 2 do
Rappin', hiphopin', and pushin this song
Love 2 the 9's
I'm not gonna stop until the war is over
SOUL
The J-U-G-H-E-A-D, and I'm flowin' with it
It ain't like my life is ended
Let me tell ya
Lover here, lover there - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
Unless a man truly dies
Cord wrapped around my neck
Baby...
Baby, won't you set me free?
Would that get U off?
Forgive me if it goes astray
No, no (Tonight I'm gonna)
All the hippies sing together
[(Just how old)]
Don't know where I'm goin' 'cuz I don't know where I've been
Look up in the air, it's your guitar
Soaked in banana cologne
(But first a message from our sponsors)
Yeah!
OK, so all u do is push the little red button...
I love u baby, I love u so much,
If U take your life 4 granted, your beating heart will go
We're gonna get over
Love you til you're dead
Dr. Everything'll be alright
What do I look 4, what shall I do?
There's no tellin' how far I'd go
There's others doing far worse than us, so be glad that U r free
You're a hard man to track down
About the boots I'm knockin'
Rules and regulations - no place in his nation
My pants where wet, they came off
When my back is so far back it's on the other side of the wall
My temperature's runnin' hot
Rio, Marbella - we gettin' stupid
When love will blow your mind (Blow your mind)
U say not in public but I say in the car
Here comes a lady so u cover up
How can I stand 2 stay where I am?
Cuz honey, it just might be the last time
(to the bridge)
Open your heart, open your mind
Get outta my face! (Honey, it's not that type of party)
That I've been dreaming of
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Too young to fall in love
Oh, Nikki, ohhhh

(Ooh, baby, no)
Falling leaves will appear 2 them
(come on, play) no!, (play) no!, (playplayplay) Yes!
(I love u baby)
Which ever one u choose is alright,
Oh, just dream, dream, dream
Hey, we got to sho'nuff get off

You were such a sexy thing
Come on, get stupid, get stupid
On the one y'all say, housequake
HA, HA, HA
Say hey hey hey (hey hey hey)
What does that have 2 do with the funk?
If so, then u can get up off hug and a kiss
A nation of alms, the production, sharing ideas, a shower of flowers
Hot thing, baby I knew U would
Up and down, up and down, feels so good
No-sha-sha
Happiness, mama, is being with u
Pick it up
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
Dishonesty, anger, fear, jealousy and greed will fall
This - Yeah, that's 4 me, that's who that 1's 4
Oh
L is 4 lust
There won't be no more enemies, so that eliminates all the fear
We gonna shake and shake and shake
I'm not a woman
Can I tell U what I'm thinkin' that U already know?
If U will, if U will, so will I
Kiss me once, kiss me twice. Life can be so nice. So nice
It will make them do the walk
That keeps me satisfied
Right there all on the floor (on the floor)
I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird (My daddy's thunderbird)
(Do that, do that somebody)

3, it be like that, see?
These 2 words, a little bit behind the beat.
Before they blow up the world

Oh baby, baby, oh baby, baby

You, you, you got to slow down

But honey I know, ain't nothing
The ones that don't know how 2 give
Just ask me and I'll try it
Thank U 4 flying Prince International
The king was looking 4 the ladder

But everybody said flying planes was cool (live 4 love)
Here's a sample
Is it really necessary 4 me 2 go out of the room
Play with my love
Ooo weee, baby. you leave me without...

Party people in the crib get hyped.

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
But even if I wanted 2 I couldn't really truely 'cause my only friend is u
"I'm of the mind to make some mookie.
All I want is 2 spend the night in your arms
You're the teacher, show me how
The best that I can
Cuz there's the key 2 unlock the body
All that matter is the present, the here and now
This year the latest fashion is 2 lie in the heat of passion
If we just trust and cut the fuss
The new testament
(U should do that baby) U should do that baby
Everybody, [two times] (Party)
Crazy, baby
Free 2 go most anywhere, anytime
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (wait a minute) (Don't kill me please)
Is it boom - death?

Je vous enlacerai avec mes jambes
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind
Talking to myself and just crying over you
This time it's serious
Pop - Daddy Pop
He can't even find a place 2 dance, this is rock and roll.
Sometimes lonely musician
I want you now
Every single day is a yellow day

Daddy Pop lead the band
Boy, we gettin' international
Before we go out
All because of color
If u're not there
Tell me - Am I qualified?
Where the tears flow (The space)
Pocket full of chance (horns, do it)
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
I would never leave U, no matter what U do

For all the fellas, and the young ladies
The door 2 the house full of people galore
I spend my nights, it's all alone
Every time u tick I'd rather u bang,
His songs are still sellin', that man
They got high when everything else got wrong (pass the booze up here)
Still I wish U heaven
Then u're floatin' homeboys boastin' 
No time 4 sorrow, this is gonna be the one

It means forever and that's a mighty long time
Go baby (Go baby)

Oh yeah, we gettin' funky in the house tonite

If God one day struck me blind
To hug and kiss you
Oh, motherfucker's, just a motherfucker
Hmph, I'm still Melody, and I'm still Cool
Holdin' my own - u think I'm posin'

Lovers like us dear are born 2 die
Alright, joy in repetition,
Grind

And even if I only see you some of the time
U cried in ecstacy
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack, Billy Jack)
U can make right (Forever I want U in my life)
Sun is risen, moon is gone
I guess we'll make love under the cherry moon
Such a bloody long time
I can make u happy (I can make u H.A.P.P.Y)

Hot thing, barely 21

Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Have U ever been so lonely
Can u tell me when we gonna get 2 it.
But I seem 2 get a kick out of doing U cold
But before a "no" was even said
I know I said I needed U
[U were on the other end of the room/hall]
Look here
And then I'll hold U tight and hold U long
They say that u ain't u know what
Downstroked and laughin'
But I'm here 2 tell u
That don't give a shit that U're Pussy Control
Smack!
Church if u will, please turn 2 the book of Victor (We s, We s)
How beautiful do the words have 2 be
The full stride for the ride
Soul of my soul (soul of my soul)
Help me girl I'm drownin', mass confusion in my head
I know that next time we march, yeah
Ah hoochie, don't do that
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
Baby didn't listen, so like a priceless work of art
With someone so much U'd take
Get on top
("Gettin' busy G, kickin' the jughead")
And my electric top went down
Yo - Margaya (jughead)
Cuz I want U 2 be with me
The river of addiction flows
That's where I wanna be
Shake! If u come 2 party now open up your mouth. Gotta shake something.
All the critics love U in New York
That u and your girlfriends used 2 ride all up and down
Say it 1 more time
4 what goes on in his mind
"Oh, I got a live one here!"
Get ready, Chili sauce!
No! (Yeah, yeah)
[starvation]
Joy, you are my private joy
And a promise to see Jesus in the morning light (mornin' light)
That's right (Party)
Oh babe (work) c'mon let's have some fun,
Gotta step in the room with the mood
(alright, say it, say it girl)
Never have I ever made love before
Now bring it up and let me kick the facts
So bright it makes u colorblind (U will be color blind)
And when your cup overflow
With U I swear, I'm a maniac, all right
U makin' me wanna ... oh!
Purple love-amour is all u're headed 4 - but don't show it
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
What U come 2 say? (Get funky [x2])
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom?"
(Oh Cindy C, Will u play with me?)
I am ready 4 the real (Come a little closer)
Living rooms
Yeah, U...U want me to walk right down your halls
I'm physically attracted to you
(3 chains o' gold)
Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
I wanna hip U all 2 the reason
Kissed me on the mouth and said "Your leader take me to"
Annie Christian wanted to be number 1
Say no - if U don't wanna live life under the gun
So we can make up our minds, love
See this ain't about sex
U should do that girl (No more will U cry)
Breath! Ooo, baby! Oooo, yeah
Love machine, yeah. Hey, yeah.
If a man is considered guilty
In someone else's box?
If we got married
Dealers for your rights. And most
Unlucky 4 him again
U got to shake something. My lord.
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Is it worth a child dying 4? (is it worth it?)
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?
They stand in the way of love
I don't want to make love 2 U
Life can be so nice. It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
(Be my friend) Dolphin
Cuz I'll surely go crazy
U know who I'm talking about
Alright y'all, everybody in the house (serve it up, Frankie)
Even though one's life is brief
My little angel from heaven above
Freaks dance like they in heaven
"'Till then I'll close my eyes and say a prayer 4 U"
But more like it never started
Would U come forth and tell no lies?
That u will hear me say
Deeper than the boom of the bass
Died of a big disease with a little name
Even if that somebody was me?
but he had grown accustomed 2 her style
Positivity
Staring each other down
I guess I must be dumb
U should do that baby
Women not girls rule my world
Ow, baby, you're much too fast
Perhaps U could show me, baby (show me, baby)
Hoping she would answer back
Party (party)
Tears came to my eyes when I asked her name
I wanna dance
Ask where they're going
I tried to bust a high note, but I bust a string
Without you loving me
Keep bustin'
Fellas? (yeah) hit me, but dontcha lag
Stand up everybody, this is your life
Razor blades from a paper cup
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
People wanna take it back
I wondered if I had enough class
Unless of course U don't believe in it
First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard
When I lie awake in my boudoir I think of u dear
But sometimes, sometimes
Don't walk wherever they tell u 2 - psyche!
Have u done this before? (I don't know)
This is just so U Come
I don't see nothin' but rain
In case u cared
But some of U may know
[Chorus]
Everything has been well placed
And the next...
Mine is temptation, it reigns at a party where lovers splurge
Before I tick, tick bang all over u
If u're always walkin' your way
baby, baby
It's all about love being in charge of this life
(Lickin' U inside) Lickin' U inside, outside
((push up on it)) (push) I push
Que viva para siempre el Poder de la Nueva Generacion
Straight into your town
Another world awaits us
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
My main concern is U and me
Girl put it where it feel good
I never fool around
Don't be surprised if I tell U 2 go bare
And if he imitates the best
Nowhere bound
And step she did 2 the straight A's
I'm pump-pump-pump-pump-pumpin' em
U were supposed to take care of me! (Love come quick) {Thieves in the temple}
"Drowning without U here my dear" ('baby')
They say you really put me down
A body that'll do U right
"Although we're worlds apart"
Only best friends can
And I'm pumpin' em, I'm pumpin' em, (push)
(willin' and able)
Then blow the candle out, let's see if it's true
With trolley cars
V is 4 the vast way u envelop my soul
(Paris, say it once more time, uh!)
Clap your hands, and stomp your feet
What's the hangup? What's the scam?
Take a picture sweetie
"I'm not gonna kill you. I want you to do me a favor,
'Orion's arms are wide enough'
Rappin' done let us down (down down)
Come on baby what U say?
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
U'll be still sayin' "Baby not 2 nite"
Feeling, feeling, feeling, hey!
Have U had your plus sign 2 day?
Positivity YES
I rock the party, I rock the house
(If U will so will I)
It's just 2:49...
All the girls say "Oh Yeah" (Oh Yeah)
Our eyes locked-thus
Don't put me on the street again
No - Til my dying day I'll be OK
Same time (rock, rock)
Sugar, I don't have to dream
Ooh shit
Who's Stella is this? My stella.

U can relax now, the Max is in control
The girlies steady hop
Get it up, get it up
Maybe U think I'm being
C'mon let's have some fun (let's work)
Just say the word and I'm gone
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Everybody, everybody knows (Lovesexy)
2 fall in love was a table reserved 4 fools
It's only mountains and the sea
So high, the stars are under me
Doin' the housequake
Don't you know that I could die, baby
It's silly, no?
'til I go right out of my mind
If I could get you in the raw, I'd make you climb the walls
He bust the jughead as he floats to the other side
And then a beautiful girl the most
Don't all girls look the same? They don't?
We ain't got no use 4 ice cream without the cake (Umm)
Sell it, don't tell it, don't tell me (joy around the corner)
Only they 2 can hear
Or will u let it drink u till dawn, drink u till dawn.
But it's cool like that
Je sais que vous aimerez ca

Ronnie talk to Russia before its too late
Whenever evil wants 2 groove

Don't you know there ain't better oh
But I what I didn't tell U is that
Who's gonna stop 200 balloons?
"You can hardly be aware
Without the help of a Margarita or Exstacy

Nouveau grind, come on (people)
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Grind, grind, grind, le grind
Ring around the rosie (Paris, are you ready?)
I wanna just letitgo (letitgo)
"See the table and the chair
Trolley cars
And now u're tryin' 2 say that u're writing a bio about me? (kick their ass)
Least we can do is make a joyful sound, oh yeah
Play around
with U than walk it alone (U are my future)
You don't have to be cool
Just got 2, just got 2 - hit it
And their idea of fun
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
(say no) No - if U can't find your way - everybody say
Puerto Ricans say it, ooh (ooh), alright (alright),

Do u think of me, or do u lie, do u lie?
I let you fool around
Two thousand zero zero party over,
I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free, yeah (Be glad that U r free)
The little things you said
Honey, we've got 2 make it better,
Don't understand why u hurt me (hurt me, hurt me)
Just like u're supposed 2 do (mpls, mpls) (2 many neighbors)
Like a flame she came and I was no longer cold
I'm thinkin' about the quivery ocean (ooh, I wanna melt with u)
But that don't compute when it comes 2 Y-O-U
Someday will drive a body down 2 the ground
2 this funky song
I can try but when I do I see U and I'm devoured, oh yes
Anyone who know how the story (How the story started)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
See this gold chain around my waist
Hear the words I'm saying, (I love u so much)
Just ask me - I'll do, I'll do,
Seems like the only thing he can do
Working my body, working my body, working my body
Up on the mic repeating 2 words, over and over again
My camera, U and me alone
But don't U know that I know
Soldiers are a marching, they're writing brand new laws
Africa divided, hijack in the air,
Not that you're helpless
(Y got to slow down)
Once upon a time in a haystack of despair,
Well hello, MC T on a mello
How can I live 4 love? (live 4 love) I'm calling
People get ready, nouveau dance here
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode
Hot - I get so excited
Strip your dress down
We need a purple high
Are U good, are U bad

Housequake, housequake
Happiness in it's uncut form
Whatever you heard about me is true
This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
Please access another experience"
People tell us what we want 2 hear
Hot thing, don't U wanna play with me?
I'm warm enough when
Said the chair to the table
Yo, yo, we gettin' funky in the house tonite
All the critics love U, all the critics love U

The spirit's calling
If we can't find no place to go
Who's wine u drinking? Mine.
Reflecting from the wet
But we got something
Now's the time 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
U made love 2 me
Na na na na na na, so slow (say it again - na na na na na na, so slow)
Naive in every way
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
I got a good shot, put your leg on the chair (Like that?)
U can make right (U are my light)
What lurks in the gallows of my mind
Get it up, oh yeah
It's you I really wanna drive
Pop life
Don't do it like that, do it like this
2 nigs united 4 West Compton [x2]
When I go down, down, down, (Come) down, down, down, da-da-down
4 letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite.
No need 2 cry
Everybody sing it, ooh (ooh), alright (alright),

But I always, always want to be with you
It don't mean your rep just cuz me tallywhacker suckin' is all U want
New position, yeah, let's go fishing in the river, the river of life
Move your head and shoulders from side 2 side

Hopefully, that will not occur; the man above has been paid
Jam Jimmy Jam Jimmy Jam Jimmy Jam Jimmy Jam Jimmy Jam Jimmy Jam Jimmy Jam!
And I'll show U a boy aware!

Touch if you will my stomach
Me or this flower right in front of my eyes
Don't talk if it's against the rules?
Now break it down
Ready 2 whisper (whisper, whatcha say)
Oh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight

There's something that I can't understand
You want me just as much as I want you
I wanna save her (save her)
I'll look 4 a needle in a haystack, that's automatic 2 (A-U-T-O-matic)
Oh Baby! I don't wanna cross that road cuz I love u 2 much
And before long I have 'em bobbin' their jugheads
If we bathe in each other's hips
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
And together we'll stare into silence
She tried to kill Reagan, everybody say gun control
Looka here young un
Don't look now, but there's a river of blood
I like 2 step, all night long
(Ah Cindy C, Will u play with me?)
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
Who is your God?
And danced upon the heads
You're the wind and the rain
Am I black or white?
Keep on walkin' down this road (joy around the corner)
Ever since I met you, baby
Shake! Come on y'all. U got 2 shake something.
It's alright 4 I am guilty of no sin
I've gotta broken heart again
But it's so hard to get you
This is the only kind of love
You say it, 1999
U can see through race car drivers
Life was closing in I just knew, I just knew I couldn't take it
Can you relate?
So much better when we take our time
Sex-related fantasy is all that my mind can see
same boogie (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock hard)
Baby you're the purple star in the night supreme
It's gonna be a beautiful night (two times)
4 all my future crimes-OH

But that's cool
Lawrence..."
I've seen the future and it will be
Maybe you'd understand
I'm gonna do ya like u wanna be done
I'm your messiah and you're the reason why
U must be ... oh yeah!
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Would U let me dress U
And if U had a chance 2 see the future would U try?
The reason that you're cool
The music rocked us
The problem with u and your kind is that u don't know love is there
Maybe we'll unlock the
(Our special presentation will start shortly)
Until a man truly dies
(the steps in between)
Drowning without your love
Hardy notion on the part of a
Listenin' 2 the grass grow?
And then, we don't have 2 make love 2 have an orgasm
I am the main thing
With a tale that will soon be classic
My lord, (housequake)
Yeah, I can be your big strong man
Whatcha want 2 eat? "Ribs"
All the sisters like it when u lick 'em on the knees

As sure as the dippy dippy wave of my 'do
Guest list? Guest list?
U can cut off all my fins
Let alone the actual act
Lie down beneath my shadow with great delight
Last night I wanted some inspiration
And wanted 2 know if I thought I was qualified, yeah
Alright, it's 1999
I ain't got time 2 waste
A real family,
My mission, so they said, was just 2 drop the bombs
Until u get 2 higher ground (higher)

It's gonna be lonely, baby
And then I can tell U that I can just smell U

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me
With one more verse 2 the story
U better be happy that dress is still on
Do ya do ya like a good man should
Occupation, if any - "Sex symbol to many, but I really got a beautiful mind"
Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (live 4 love)

Pheromone, when your body's wet (body's wet, body's wet, body's wet)
Feel the sex I'm laying (maybe we can stay in touch)
Baby but I r, I'm a (star)
U had the nerve 2 think it was funny (funny)
I want 2 melt with u
I want my slimmie 2 get with this
The one who will listen when all others will not.
I'd rather hear u say 4 ever
U got 2 shake something. My lord.
Change up like a sock
(Don't say it, preacher)
Boom! Boom!
Stay awake 4 4teen hours
I give you everything I can, yeah
it's enough to make you want to lose your mind
Come on tell me what U taste
Four - Oh (come on), your the best
If I had the chance 2 do it all again
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinkin'
Don't nobody know the trouble I've seen (live 4 love)
Every time u get some push
Can't feed guerillas
We are beautiful, it's gonna be a beautiful night
Ooh baby, just say the word
And time spent alone my friend, will cease
(In a second hand store)
Cold housin' a future
Sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be
When we're makin' love, I can't hold back
The one and only Daddy Pop
(Loose!) When the music hits U don't know what 2 do
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (Ya know he's too bold)
Just what U mean 2 me
Yeah, 1999 (1999)
If U had the chance
And it was Joni singing "Help me I think I'm falling"
C'mon Cindy (Wait)
Daddy Pop's in the house
The sexy motherfucker's so fine I could drink her bathwater
(grind, grind)
Can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
Get funky
You're so slippery
Don't fit in your video game
Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
It's where I wanna be
Of course I'll undress in front of U!
Pheromone, (Pheromone) rush over me like an ocean
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea
When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon
That's automatic 2 (A-U-T-O-matic)
Just like I got no conscience, just like I got no qualms
Three - Ooo, sock it to me
Give us this day our daily bread
(until the end of time)
I never could resist
I can't have a hug (unless)
There'll be bread 4 all, y'all
Mmmmm, my strange relationship
That's right baby
So here, my target is approaching
And now I'm just as blue as I can be
When I was your man?
Like slow motion rain (slow motion, slow motion)
No matter how much I try 2 stoppa
'Cuz in this life
I've never known a love so sweet
I want 2 watch (watch)
This is a motherfucking party
I'd be like "Yeah man"
Is that all your gold?
Glad 4 what I had baby, (Be glad 4 what U had and)
My nickname's Hell's-a-Poppin', I'm badder than the Wicked Witch
"Since U've been gone"
One 2 one (one 2 one)
Not with a 9 fadin' my back
Will we all fight 4 the right 2 be free?
Rock, rock, rock, rock
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
U have just accessed the Beautiful Experience
Vthis love that I've been waiting for, a Love solid as rock
Girls first, girls first

My name is Prince
Look, here's a cool investment
Long days, lonely nights
In seven measures I want somebody 2...
U can go platinum 4 times
That's a fact
Vous etiez de l'autre cote de la salle
I'll never, never stop loving you
Yo so, come get a hit
Steady hip-hop rockin' rollin (push)
I'd rather dance my life away (1999)
We'll work till morning comes (let's work)
Don't know what they mean
And Nikki started to grind
I'd buy U clothing, buy U fancy cars
She's just a victim of society
New power wave your hand, everybody sing out across the land
I wanna know
Wait a minute now
Where the love grows
Blow that devil away!
U, U gotta climb, U gotta climb (U have 2 climb all)
2 get through this thing called life
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

All my life this heart's been under lock and key
"Stop the press..."
And now U're gone and I just wanna be still
Yeah, homey, kick it just like that
Don't talk until they tell u 2?
I'm Melody Cool
The funkiest man U've ever seen
U're such a queen bee
Close - don't worry about nobody else
This experience will cover courtship, sex, commitment..
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and US history
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Tell me do u feel it 2
I just want u smarter than I'll ever be
"O delightful little brother! (can't nobody fuck with us)
And we went riding
I've been searching 4 a lover
If U can hang, U can trip on it
With a girl as fine as she was then
A-U-T-O-matic
It ain't about the trippin', but the sexuality - turn it up
Love can save us all
We don't care
It's time we all reach out for something new
I just looked her in her eyes
Don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me
I just want 2 settle down and
There's something else
Better days gonna come your way soon
"Vicky Vale"
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun
This is safe sex, (Ooh - I wanna melt with u)
Nuclear Ban never stays in tune
They say in disgust, they singin' their guts
Darlin' Nikki

U must'a took (U must'a took)
On my heart, on my mind, (truly adore U)

Trojan and some of them used
Get funky - yeah (get funky in the house tonite)
Something 2 believe in, a reason 2 believe that there's a heaven above

That it's killin' me, baby, 2 be without U
C'mon baby
Give me something I can feel
I just want 2 look at U
Go (The space)
U could burn up my clothes
U seem perplexed I haven't taken u yet
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
Girls and boys
I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth
and then we could make a story of our own
Can U hear me? Why do I love U so much?
I'll tell Your story, no matter how long (no matter how... no matter)
I'm the victim, U're the robba
Yes, a fool
Miko, Miko, hit me in the back with funk
(Ring di di ding) comebody's calling
That Lovesexy was the glam of them all?

Billy, Billy, oh yeah yeah yeah!
Until then she's held at bay
Than see u get it like that
But I didn't like the way U where, so I had 2 make U mine
I wanna be in the new breed, Stand up, Organize
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
Kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?
Don't u look at me
Shake! (shake, shake, shake)
He just makes her point the pistol 2 his nose
I really get a dirty mind
What makes a man wanna rule the world? (A double A double arrogance)
(Honey, look at this one here) (I'm lookin' Joe tryin' 2 see)
Why does my brother have 2 go hungry
"The jester's on the phone!"
Extinguish all clothing materials and pull my body close 2 yours
She'd be a much-better-off-left fool (Face the music)
London, what does Big Ben say?
She's so lonely, gets in her hair
New coat, huh?
And what we're looking 4 still isn't found
What if I gave it, your body I ask
(Don't say it preacher)
(alright) I push (push) ((push up on it))
But in going down an alley
And he told her not 2 know was better
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
If I flip 'em on my stomach will u marry my ass?
So the bigger the hole, the bigger we fill it (fill it!)
Flashin' a loaded pistol, 2 dumb 2 be true
Who asked your ugly ass what time it was? Nobody.
All over u, tick, all over u, tick, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
U wanna hurt me in the dark
(I love u so much)
I felt sorry 4 all creation
If you show your...

All the white people in the house say ooh (ooh), alright (alright),
Do U know? (strange relationship)

Love Him, love Him baby
She asked me if we could be friends
(Love) in love - can U hear me?

It makes U feel clever (Put your love down)
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong
Is it really important where I take my naps? (no)
(Let's work) nothing can stop us now (nothing gonna stop us)
Kiss away
I'll gladly pee in anybody's cup
That army bag
(All the time)
You were kinda sorta my best friend
(say no) No - if U're afraid, everybody ain't got it made
But honey I'm rich on personality
Do U ever really cry? (Do U ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
Love come in a hurry
Pray let us take the air!"
They just don't know
They loved 2 kiss on the steps of Versailles
I want your love
Think about IT all the time (fuckin' on your mind)
Round and round we go, round and round we go
Why do U dog him
U
I've got the noise, 2 make u scream and shout (the love machine)
There's a brand new groove goin' round
But the truth is what we need to reach our point
I change the rules and do what I wanna do
He's looking 4 a saviour in a city full of fools
In other words - its R.E.A.L meaning of this thing called love
Light (u turn on a) Blue light
Dance girl - lemme see the booty boom
(u got it)
2 shine on both of us
I mean, we don't have 2 make children 2 make love
I said "Momma don't put me under pressure (get on, get on ...)
(Sex) Sex between 2 people is alright
Maybe you're just like my mother
We gotta rock this mother, say (housequake)
"I'm not gonna kill U"
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone
C'mon raise your hand
ABSCAM
Partyman
Superfunkycalifragisexy (woah yeah)
So sue me if I go 2 fast
Take a break from 9 to 5
When I call U up, I wanna tell U what 2 wear
And they will shine 4 ever
It would take forever to get you off my mind
It's gonna be a beautiful
I don't see no 5 dollars U owe...
Hard to not let it get you down
I'll introduce U 2 my ride
I can't stop I ain't got no brakes
Don't cry, he is coming
Baby I'm a (star)
Shut up already, damn
"I just like the sound of it."
Detroit - what's happenin'?
(letitgo)
I've got 3 chains o' gold
Of all the things that base a rhyme
Give back the chains - if you don't you will die
Maybe I'll die young like heroes die
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock (oh Daddy)
Light us up and take a hit, light us up and take a hit
(love 4 all time)
Sing it (We are all a star!)
(Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long)
Just lay back
We're gonna shake, we're gonna quake
Guitar solo

That night I had 2 call U
I want to spit some game but I said to myself
Tommy Barbarella, turn it on
Raise your hand up, straight in the air
I love u and I think u're fresher - push" (push)
But I didn't have any cream
Meet me somewhere after dawn
(back and forth)
I don't mean 2 be rude
I know from righteous I know from sin
Step right up and I'll strap U in
2 words falling between the drops and the moans of his condition
4 your every touch I
U can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it 4 U
What are u gonna do to prove it?
"In the sea of tranquility" ('lonely')
Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
Trying to beat me like playing pool with a rope
U kiss your enemies
U need another lover
Now morning, noon, and night
Oh baby, baby, baby
Wait a minute, what's he doin'? (get stupid, get stupid)
17 tongues licking from the neck down moving in a quickspeed circular motion
I get hard if the wind blows your cologne near me
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation
I'll dis a beat if it teases
It could only make u stronger
Marvelous - baby, baby, can't U see
I didn't want you to be mis-led
And put your thinking cap on
The funkier I get, oh shit
Little boy got the notion, get some love tonight
Everybody's going Uptown
So I can work on that zipper, baby
Are you ready?
"Like what the fuck do they know.
I get delirious whenever you're near (Delirious)
4 him each day she had a smile
Tell me what 2 do babe (A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with U)
(drop out them horns)
'scuse me y'all (we sacrifice)
A love like ours just hard to be
I just want you so bad
(Do U ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?) Try, try
Will u fuck with me,
'Tll I get your daughter I won't leave this town
2 night it's gonna be scandalous
{Out on my block I'm just a loner} (we sacrifice)
We're gonna work all night
And the sky that's, oh, so blue
Yeah, that's what they want u 2 do
Down, down, down, down [x4]
Come on, come on (Endorphinmachine)
What distortion could U let your pen forget 2day?
Is it fair to kill the youth?
U better look it over before you overlook
Kid! Yo Kid!
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone
Tick, tick, bang, all over u. tick, tick, bang, all over u
Babe, you got to slow down
Yeah, yeah, I'll jack u off
What you need is a manager (That's what I'm sayin')
Levi, Levi, fly
That's the one thing that I don't play
I've been wantin' to lay you down
When U hear it your heart will thunder
And squeeze my... yeah
We're going down, down, down, if that's the only way
(If U had a chance 2 see the future would U try?)
La da da da da da
She worked the night shift
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy)
I can't stand tight asses in my place
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday)
I think it's time 2 bust somethin'
A government of love and music boundless in its unifying power
Celibate friend (No more will U cry), pretending
And wanna leave me baby
Yeah, that's the only (Come) time
This beat is on time, refined and designed
(A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with U)
It makes me dance, It makes me cry
You wouldn't have stopped
What?
Hey Ducky, let me stick the 7-inch
Come on everybody, let's get out on the floor.
Thought I'd take u to a movie show
Mine is the running hot water of the daughter of morality
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)
(sacrifice... if u turn the page)
Anything is better than the picture of the child
I won't leave this - leave this - leave this
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?
(Loose!) Bangin' gangs, slangin' wangs and rock
Baby, I gotcha where I wantcha,
A body like yours oughta be in jail
If I was your girlfriend
He just one in a long line that wanna see me!
And there's always a rainbow, at the end of every rain
Release it, listen 2 me now, release it yeah.
Oooh Doggies!
U're like ice cream,
Yeah - this is 4 the hood
Before I tick, tick, bang, all over u

This is the main thing
Ow, girl, she's just gone mad
Come on y'all, we got 2 jam
Push up on it (get on the mike, woman)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
Get close, have no fear, (have no fear)
Narrow-minded drag
She couldn't stop cryin'
Will ever compare
It happens 2 us all
A bridge that leads them 2 a love they know is real
I don't understand
Joy - you are my private joy
Joy, joy (love me) in repetition,
(Sex, sex) is all I heard
But I've got 2 tell U what U mean 2 me, all right (all right)
I guess I'll just spend my life
More than your brother
If you know what I'm singing about up here
When you know we cannot walk!" (can't nobody)
See "J" Billy Jack Bitch
I heard the rip when u sat down
Me? No I'm not a man. Jerome? He's an adventure.

The bomb go boom.

Sun up in the sky just a shinin' (just a shinin')
(God created woman)
She knew how 2 get her kicks
Poor butterfly who don't understand
'Cause you give me what I want
U R the new kings of the world!
Their stomachs will pound
Not the half truth like U used 2 so help U God?
But I'm, I'm a tad more interested (Ah ha ha look it,)
They know we need each other
(Little Red Corvette)
just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
A-U-T-O-matic, oh, I'm so in love with U
First u gotta tell me what u want me to do
Sexuality is all we ever need
Sex is not all I think about
My sister didn't give a goddamn
Trying to save their own
Waiting for that love
As the door closes, baby starts 2 cry
"I'm BATMAN!"
I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power
Yeah, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna wanna, I wanna fuck you
I could tell U now but we'd be here 'til next September
When U let your fingers do the walkin' in and out and all about
With different color socks
And I want U 2 pump your hips like U used 2
If you think I'm crazy, you're probably right
All the fighting stopped
When I'm in a sad and lonely mood dear, I cry 4 u dear (I cry 4 u)
Be glad 4 what you've got
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
So if U don't mind (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Do U swear 2 tell the whole truth
{{title repeated in background}}
Will make a picture all will see and go
There's a rumor goin' all round that u ain't been gettin' served (Gett off)
And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky

And give it this much affection
Blue light
Interrupt the flow (They better not dare)
She had so many devices
Every time I could, I would compilment u on the things,
Just like the ones that U call me?
Not knowing where I'm going
'Bout time, come in
Go baby, go baby, go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Damn u, baby u're so fine
And naughty things that we could do
The love machine will take your body higher
No one in the whole universe
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette

Little Talk Johnny blew the big score

This is what she'd say
One touch and I'm satisfied (ooh, baby)
I only want to be with you
Love the one who is love, (love) the one who gives us the power, (power)
(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart)
They turn me on
I got 7 hours, baby. So what cha wanna do?
Sing it! (We are all a star!)
It ain't like that
That's alright, I clock 'em that way
But I'm scared, 'cause if I don't kiss ya, I'm gonna go mad baby
Loneliness already knows U
Any one boy or girl?
Cuz I'm dead (on it, on it, on it)
This chair goes round and round, I feel like a clown
Daddy Pop (oh Daddy)
Yeah yeah yeah
We could have a good time
Ah... am I gettin' U hot? (Hot)
You say you want a leader
But I just can't seem 2 get close enough (I want to hold U)
I'll do ya do ya like a good man should
Shall we say we're in Paris? (I don't know)
It's a dime, as in dollars and that's my 2 bloody cents
She'll want me from my head 2 my feet
All I can do is just offer u my love
I wanna bust that body right
The spirit is calling
They could find a carousel

Every time they try 2 clock u push

Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
They got the draft, uh uh

(Loose!) Get your education first then buy a pair of shoes
Raspberry beret
In baby who knows how long (Gett off)
Close your eyes
Before my life is done
That there's hope 4 a kid
Just like u're supposed 2 do (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
All of the steps in between (the steps in between)
They know U are my fix
And said, "C'mere"
Oh my God here U are
Paisley Park is in your heart
As they hastened to their side (fuck with us)
U are my God, I am Your child
Oh baby, don't you know?
Is 2 let u do your own thing
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must
We ask that U please observe the "No Letting Go" sign
The space, the space, the space, the space
Up and down, up and down,
U wouldn't be satisfied with a one night stand
I said life is just a game
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
"Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U"
A whirlwind designed 2 slow U down
That if we play in the same key everything will be
Tell me what 2 do babe
I just can't keep it to myself
She took a whip to me until I shout
If u do 2 much, your skin will be sensitive 2 touch
Oh no, don't U think about callin' her a ho (Are U ready?)
[Chorus 2x]
Who loved him with a passion, uncontested
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long make you shout
Revolution, baby way down low
But all good things, they say, never last
So remember the truth you cant go wrong
My little secret, my private joy
Daddy Pop
I know that's right, 'cause I am the latest fashion
New Power, New Power, give it 2 me
When I'm doing the best I can
'That's where I wanna be' ("the arms of Orion")
And u think u got it bad
That's the only way it'll get bigger
U and me all night, alright Blue light
Place in your heart
(2 many neighbors)
I took U 4 a ride and baby I'm sorry
The little 1 will escort U
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy) (Prince)
What do u expect 2 win when u're used to playing craps?
Ask what I'm kickin', I'm kickin' the flow
And if ya don't really love me
Where the souls go (The space)
(God created woman) (woman)
Sittin' in the back and I'll jack u off
Now do something I've never seen before (how u wanna, how u wanna be
U could drop on her
Gett off - I u want 2 baby here I am
Shall we give in 2 our biggest fears? (the love machine) (Are u afraid?)
Morning glories never cry. My love for u, baby, drips
I'm OK as long as u are here with me
Come let me fly U 2 the moon
'Til the end of time I'll be there 4 U
Get the funk up!
Hey, take a listen
G flat major with an E in the bass
And this is where she wants 2 stay
This 1's 4 Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing
She so close I can touch her (touch her)
Oh yeah, sweet baby, someway, somehow
I don't care 4 1 night stands
U must become a prince before u're king anyway
Everybody wanna see u down 4 the count
U don't mind
When she co-signed and then told him she was ...
Is this reality or just another facade?
"This town needs an enema!"
"Think about the future"
I'm not talkin' about just ordinary temptation, people. I'm talking
Our Father, who art in Heaven
("Is this the right one?")
Maybe u should have played an ace
Let's do it
Love's kiss was running all thru my veins
Don't walk unless the others do?
I'd do anything just 2 heat up your cold touch
(I wanna melt with u)
We need a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
This is 4 the cab U have 2 drive 4 no money at all
U say u'll call me and then and then u don't
Can u understand, Martha?
Your face is jammin'
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Live music from a band plays a song called "Soul Psychodelicide".
U can wear what U want 2, it doesn't matter - in New York
I've been trying to interview
Lookin' 4 something 2 get us in the mood
You don't need experience
I think U wanna play house
Stand tall, (tall)
Something that'll make it all right
She said sign your name on the dotted line
[Backwards talking in the background]
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do U ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
(Do U ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?) Cry, cry
Every time U do me - such a rush
What makes him wanna see his name in lights? (A double A double arrogance)
The choice u make is vital
U need me... Push for yours, and watch for
I woke up (U woke up)
Swing it 2 the right, savoir faire
U - I would die 4 u, yeah
Get it?
Sugar do U know what I'm saying 2 U this evening? (sugar)
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
{S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E}
Put your love down there...
U want me to write my name on your walls
The smile on their faces
That's in France on the south side
Thank God this ain't Monopoly
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna fuck you
So u know there ain't nothin',
(get off me, punk, U ain't sexy)
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain
U are, was, and always will be Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
And head back 2 a life so tough
There was 1 September day that Papa worked 2 hard
There was a girl in Paris
When I give the cue scream, alright?
I can hang when u're around
The attack on my plane is steadily mounting (live 4 love)
"But I just a virgin And I'm on my way to be wed
It was only last June when her old man ran away
Little girl, we can go on a date
U always seem 2 lose
Next time we march (Hey yeah) (Whoa)
We r here 2 do service
Boom - I take a deep breath
What more do you want me to do?
The girlies steady hop (there ain't no stoppin')
Get up, get up, get in
We gotta do it in your momma's car
Oh yeah?
Frontin' more booty than Peru got keys
"She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy
Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
We r the new power generation.
Boy versus girl in the world series of love
And we'll groove and groove until the earth moves (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
So quiet, I can hear the blood rushing through my veins
A-come on, a-come on, a-come, a-come p-p-push it, push (push)
Why do we scream at each other
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
Like a pony would, pony would
a little self-centered (if I was your girlfriend)
Now put that suitcase down
Dontcha.
Many serpents who have lied (lied)
Ain't no doubt about your... (lemon crush)
Twist little sister and go 2 heaven
Rockin', rollin', oh yeah

If u don't wanna lick my knees, I'm sho' your mama will

What is sacrifice?
That's when you need to be tryin'
U should do that baby (If U will, so will I)
Wave your hand in the air, everybody
Just like u're supposed 2 do
You just gotta let me lay ya
Sometimes I want 2 curse the ground u walk on
Alright cut! Fade 2 black
12 inches of non-stop sole
Listen 2 me
U got that look, yes U do (yes U do)
Give what you can, all you can stand, and all of your life will be made
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
(2 the max)
Lucy cried, I almost died, U know what we found?
You are soft and wet (Oh, sugar)
Your girlfriends told u that I'm the rover
Though, you are far
Come here baby, yeah
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
If I, uh, just give her a little ear?
But honey all I wanna do

And may your cup overflow I'll pee some more
When he says you ain't gave him nothing.
Work your body like a whore
If u ain't chicken baby, come here
I guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you
Boy, U better act like U understand
(I'm gonna drive U crazy)
Girl you gotta take me 4 a little ride up and down
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold
Hey, pardon me 4 living, (pardon me 4 living)
If I could I would give u the world (Give u the world)
L.o.v.e. - l.o.v. - can U hear me?
They're tellin' him he just can't lose
With my tongue in the crease, baby I go 'round
(Right into the ground)
And mine, little darlin', mine is the opposite of ice
It's just around the corner, it's just around the block
I took one look at you
I'll do any and everything u want me 2 do
She was rollin' 4-deep
T-minus 60 seconds and counting
Kickin' the jughead, yeah (Doin' the jughead)

Hot thing, I can't wait 2 get U home
Let's take a drive, love
The room, the room, the room is spinnin' around (Delirious)
Say yes

When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)

Now run and tell your mama about that!

Hot thing, tell them U found a brand new baby doll
She lives in starvation

I can almost taste the thoughts within your mind
For all time

A blow job doesn't mean blow
Bullshit!
How long would u save it?
If u can't beat 'em, (if u can't beat 'em)

Who asked her lover "Why is your organ so small?"
No way 2 differentiate (No way 2 differentiate)
Everything that money could buy

Lady - don't ask questions
Is the mailman jerking U 'round?
Lord, I'm willing and able
