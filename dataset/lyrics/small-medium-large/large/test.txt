I could play with your mind.
4 all we know it's been there all the time.
You got to not talk dirty, baby
I'm so in love with you
(help me tell me what it's all about)
Oooh Blue light
Well, Mack daddy in the house over there
Like a child lost in the wilderness
Uh, cuz we, cuz we, cuz we dead on it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Somebody holler if U wanna party
We gonna love all our enemies
Look over here at me, workin' 4 Willie (check it out man, check it out)
The man in the moon is smiling
Tippy, tippy, tin my friend or shall we begin?
Things didn't turn out quite like I wanted them 2
Words of compassion, words of peace
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
U were all I ever wanted to do
Everyone come behold Christopher Tracy's Parade
No child is bad from the beginning... they only imitate their atmosphere
Everybody shake. (Shake, shake, shake)
I learned my lesson young, I said if want to have fun (go 4 it)
I can't wait no longer child
(If U had the chance 2 see the future would U try?)
Do it all night
Money didn't matter yesterday,
"Since U've been gone I've been drowning" ('lost')
Cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
I was only 16, but I guess that's no excuse
I do believe that we've... truly touched on something... nouveau
If I planned 2 do her any harm
Like a pony would (Like a pony would)
Oh, oh, what does it take to make you see
If I come back as a woman, I want a body like yours
She said u told her a fantasy
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Built like she was
I just laugh
Then what's she doing over here with me? Umm.
319 (319)
It don't not compute (Don't not compute)
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely
There must be more coming from
And the music starts 2 swell
You're leaving me no choice
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
This time I promise,
I'm gonna talk so sexy
Would u be, would u, would u
Oh girl, every thing's alright
Tonight we're gonna have some fun (come on, say it...)
U know the one - Dr Everything'll Be Alright
Is that a good man
I pray that when U dream, U dream of how we kissed
Gonna show u what your hips r made 4
'Cuz every time U leave me, I die, that's automatic 2
It's 2:45, we got all night
On every wall in every school
Lickety split on the lyric
Not 2 know (Come) it (know it) when I blow it (blow it)
There okay okay
I shot the boy ("Pop! Pop!"), huh, twice in the head
I can't stop, ah, thinking about uou
4 those who want 2 go, (4 those who want 2 go)
Oh baby my one and only desire (make this feelin' last)
When I'm in your arms it's all that I can do
Strollin', strollin' we could have fun just strollin'
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain
Don't talk 2 strangers
Mountains
Look here Marsha, I'm not sayin' this just 2 be nasty
Your furry melting thing awaits me
I'll jack u off, jack u off
He was tryin' to rest y'all when He heard the sound
Do me baby, don't wanna do it all alone
And when we do (When we do)
Some BIG, some are small
Unless they walk the way u want them 2?
Don't you know it's gonna be lonely
It kinda turned me on when she looked at me
Memories die but taxes
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through
It's alright, baby (Go Baby)
Go crazy
Ooooo thunder
One that deserves a copy made?
If you ain't busy 4 the next 7 years (Next 7 years)
Tell me
I got to have you in my bed
(one more)
They pose and wheelers and
High on crack, totin' a machine gun
I can make you... Money minders are like parasites
I'd think by now you'd know
Don't pick my apples, don't pick my peaches
There's joy in repetition
Please enjoy your experience
We're gonna teach him that love will make him tall (somehow)
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker
[We'll meet]
And I'll take off yours
Who?
U can cry 4 ever, but u'll get no sympathy
My curtains were drawn there wasn't nobody home
Where can it be?
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir
If you'd just believe your whole world would change
Joy
(play) no, (play) no, (play) no
2 hell with hesitation
Doesn't my body look good in the shadows?
I'll tell you what I wanna do
The max - We can dance if u want 2 (ooh yeah), but I might break yo back
Strip down, strip down. Elephants and flowers.
Don't let them pull u down
Be glad 4 what U had baby, what you've got
Confusion!
What if I filled your eyes with tears
It's flyer 2 be hungry than phat
But it's all right, it's 4 a worthy cause
Everything u do is success
I'd like 2 have the defendant place her hands behind her back
Around the world in a day
They've taken a lifetime lease
The constellations never fail
There was a dame from London
And able (able)
Hello Prince, Yes.
Until u're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs
Will be taken by the cross
Papa...
(Prince...) (get on the mike) Push up on it
Tell me what cha do, tell me what cha eat
Cause we know U know
But my Lord he is so quiet when He calls your name
In the Sea of Tranquility
Hot thing
Prince?
The castle started spinning
So U found me
Yeah - I'm a-push up on it... (push)
The voice of many colors sings a song
Even though we had big fun (even though we had big fun)
I may not be your style
Everybody's looking 4 (if you believe)
Push (hey) ((push up on it))
In a word or 2 - it's u I wanna do
There's some talk going 'round town
Everybody, oh Lord, oh yeah, I'm delirious (Delirious)
It said thank you for a funky time
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight
But U are a natural beauty unaffected (unaffected)
In the temple tonight
and all good things, they say, never last
No one will ever know
No 1 else could understand U, you're 2 complex
Ceases still I know
C'mon everybody
4 a friendly word
You need a love that's gonna last
Unless, of course, U're feelin' like a punk and take the bank
(good god)
This morning there was joy in my heart 'cause I know that I loved u so
happiness sometimes hard 2 find. (yeah)
Oh everybody yeah
U're just a simpleton
Incest is everything it's said to be
I'm gonna go to the car
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit
Lay down your funky weapon.
Then everything will be Alright
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,
everbody feelin' alright, y'all say it
So that 5-0 can't find me and I'm sneakin'
Baby, you're much too fast
Now watch this
'2 hold us both together'
Say what, huh? (Oh)
Everybody in the west
"We could talk some more, (maybe we can stay in touch)
Don't believe me? (no)
America, America
C'mon y'all, we got 2 live 4 love (live 4 love)
Get up offa my block, because
Doin' IT, doin' IT, doin' IT, doin' IT
Just as long as it's hot

The love machine cleanses with a little faith
U got 2 shake something. (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, now, all now
Because baby, you're the living end (Tell me now)
You've got the butterflies all tied up
This beat is on time, all of the time
I am yours now and u are mine
Now this is the failure I must confess (well...)
Tony, you... And you laugh at my brother Little Richard
U are fine (Fine)
Gett off - I'll only call u after if u say I can
No! (people) Is what Spooky Electric say (everbody say)
Tonight we're gonna lose our sorrow (soulful you are, are you ready?)
'cause I plan 2 be a cool kitty
(Freaks on the floor) (Now) [x3]
All the poets and the part time singers always hang inside
My brain is jackin' all over the place
Than sleeping on a rainy day
We're all alone in a villa on the Rivera
I never meant to cause you any pain
But that ain't what being a real man's about
Ooowww, c'mon, am I in the right place? (La la la la la la la)
2 people crazy in love
If your body needs water
I don't wanna stop, no
I know what you want me to do
All I'm trying 2 say is that my psychadelic shouts
That fate (fate) brought us together
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...
(Honey, you got to slow down)
Can't stop. can't stop.
What can I lose,
Don't scream
Excuse me but I need your chemistry
Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
I was headed 4 the kill, steal, destroy, and die
He can't understand, I say 2 tough
What's wrong with u? ["Operator, what city please?"]
Fellas... (get on the mike)
Cuz I want u 2 have fun
(I remember how U kissed me)
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Cuz all I ever wanted 2 do was 2 be with U ... ow!
"In every man's life there will be a hang-up
(Answer? Honey, U ain't gonna quit)
I'll go down on U all night long, it's automatic,
There's no place I'd rather be
Girl - I hate 2 say this - nigga please (tell 'em)
That everything will shine (Forever)
Pardon me 4 living, but this is my world 2
Til your love is red
Shake! U got 2 shake something.
Of the past, for life, prince... (I said who popped the question?)
(bring it to me)
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that Love is bad
Girl (Could U be?)
Or are your inhibitions gone? (They are.)
(get on the mike) Push up on it
New power generation, you've got to rearrange. We've got
Dig if you will the picture
Can I see U?
U can say it's 7
'That's where I wanna be'
Everybody get up, it's gonna be a beautiful night
Down by old man Johnson's farm
But I cry when we're apart, yeah
March, we march [x2]
Do me baby all night long
"Hey, it's the man! Yeah, let's see what's going on!"
Can be faster than a runaway train
Left-wing guerillas
Just as long as there is you
You to lay me down
U got 2 shake something
no hear U say (time 2 do the grind)
I can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got
Like animals just born 2 breed
U could say that I'm a terminal case
Fellas? Yeah! Hit Me!
If u're looking for somewhere to go
Of your fine city
Would U let me take care of U and do all the things
I can feel the tension through the crack in the door
Every nationality and size
Clap your hands double time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's O-O-K
Closer we get 2 the space
Lust
The first person that touches u, u want 2 fuck
I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah
Kiss me once, kiss me twice. Life can be so nice. So nice. So nice
Never juicin' yourself,
So come on y'all (oh yeah)
I will never try to keep you down
Gotta go-go-go
This is 4 the women, so beautifully complex
(Loose!) Everybody wants 2 know what's wrong with U
'Cuz U - I would die 4 u, yeah
Honey, 4 2 long
Pop Daddy (oh yeah) - Daddy Pop
This feeling's so good in every single way
No, no - U'll like them
Then tell me what will!
And everybody still wants 2 fly
((Trash it up cause we ain't through)) (oh yeah)
Fine, Fine. What sign u are - "Stop sign"
Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
U jerk your body like a horny pony would
Please u, baby
I'm so... (Be glad 4 what U had and for)
In a cloud of gas
Why those before us hated each other
C'mon, c'mon, U say (Party)
What time is it? Yount! It's killing time, Morris!
To have an attitude
Like thunder (thunder) all thru the night (thunder yeah)
We can talk all we want 2, but the world still goes around and round.
Grind, grind, grind, grind
LA? - yeah (well, jughead)
Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
L-L-L-L-Lovesexy
But I got 2 have your face
Goin' uptown, baby
Oh (Are U ready?)
I've got to have it
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
The things you do to me in bed
If he poured his heart into a glass
If u and I were just ten feet closer
Passion flows and who knows
The max (oooh, get funky)
Uh huh, uh huh
And now I know (I know)
Free 4 a couple of hours (Free 4 a couple of hours)
Shhh - break it down (Oh)
The love my friends rap about I keep anticipating
C'mon, c'mon, you
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
Dig it now
Don't try to play me 4 yesterday's fool
(Loose!) Won't gain U nothin' but an angry cop
That's right
After a look much louder than words she said, "I passed my initiation
This love (This love is a private affair)
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know U
Spirit's calling
Got ya
So the ducky and the little browny- (say it, y'all)
But a horse couldn't drag your ass 2 put me on
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la
Here we are folks
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night
I don't understand what made u go
It's strange, I'm more comfortable around U when I'm naked,
U surely won't fall (Put your love down)
Now all of the sudden (all of the sudden)
Everybody...
People tell me what I want to hear
Right now I hate U so much I wanna make love until U see
Hot thing, tell them you're going 2 the Crystal Ball
Can I see it, baby? (Mmm) Ow!
What was that? After shock!
But her kingdom never comes, thy will be done
Oh, no Let's Go!
Yeah, gotta go, gotta go
Baby, lay me down
I've held your hand so many times
Yes - if U want it now raise your hand 2 the man above
That's all that I've been dreaming of
Don't make me waste my time
So much I say bring it on
Baby, (2 the 9's)
Oh, pretty little whip, U got me drippin'
Whatever you decide, I'll still love you, baby
Instead of getting burned (yount)
If I gave u diamonds and pearls (Diamonds)
You're doing the housequake
Who do ya trust if U can't trust God?
Hot thing, what's your fantasy
But when u got it baby, nothing come 2 hard
It's such a shame our friendship had to end
Then I see u on the beat and do a def strip tease
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree
But U gotta talk 2 me, baby, tell me who U really r
Oh, yeah yeah!
I wish we were all nude
"Get 'em! Take the pictures!"
Are u going 2 make love with sound? (the love machine, higher love machine)
If I was your one and only friend
Two - Oh yeah
So silent, I'll just let my senses sleep
We go round and round and round.
Would U run 2 me if somebody hurt U
Giggle that U do?
Our parents wondered what it was like 2 have another color near
And even when I'm right, I'll be wrong,
Said "Only the children born of me will remain"
There's a rumor goin' all round that u ain't been gettin' served
It's so sad but I hate U like a day without sunshine
Our [innocent] symbol of glory ((I've got more holes than a golf course))
And the 2 and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it
Le Grind, grind
Gotta always have you in my heart
{Joy for sale down on the corner} (we sacrifice)
I'm just frozen on an upbeat
Never understood my old friends laughing
Cuz it's flyer 2 be hungry than phat
A magnum fro is better when u got a poof on it
This is the man that stands next 2 the man
I want 2 see the booty boom before I even let
And she said all she wanted was a good man
Shhh - huh, we got 2 break it on down
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
When I suck U there
Baby it's true, I think I do
Do u want 2 go?
(Put it where it feels good)
It looked like rain, mama, birds do fly
Wait right there and I'll be right back
Let's get hyped y'all. Release it.
(all the babies sing it now)
Those are the things that bein' in love's about (sugar)
We're kickin' down the door
So beautiful, beautiful
We're all gonna die
If we only want to love one another
Making money, losing time
2night I'll teach U baby, teach U baby, teach U baby
Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know
If u was thinkin' the same
Whatever u want 2 do,
Will U shine a light and try 2 guide me?
Drummer, do your thang
I just wanna lay ya down
'Girl, U need Pussy Control'" (Are U ready?)
Are u up on this?
Rockin', Rollin' (Rockin', rollin', oh yeah)
Why can't u learn 2 play the game?
Can I talk 2 U? {{chorus repeated in background}}
What's it gonna be
U better wake up and release it
'cause ain't just any man qualified 2 take u home
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
I'll gladly (we can funk) pee in anybody's cup
(Go Morris, go Morris, go Morris, go Morris, go Morris)
Lemme see ya work
Cuz we doing fine.
Like the lion in the jungle (get on the mike)
Happy's what I get when we do what we do
2 night is gonna be scandalous
In your city, in your town: Housequake
Whole town went under nobody saved (Melody, Melody)
The search was over at least 4 2night
I don't know, I don't know why we ever had 2 part
A long, leggy 5'8"
1999 don't stop, don't stop, say it 1 more time
I feel for you - I think I love you
Your right 2 die and live again, live again, live again
I'll lose myself inside u till u get all I got
(La la la la la la)
Act your age, mama (Not your shoe size)
That would make shakin' that ass
She the new hero cuz she's so divine
I don't want to stop, 'til I reach the top
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Buy some dirty magazine
I'm scared 'cause though we just met there's this energy between us,
Let's leave him out of this Hell, that ain't no joke.
People everywhere, loosen up your hair
All that is wrong in my world (U are my light)
Are you ready? (Hey!)
This is Prince
Go on, go on.
Papa said "Yeah, I know, that's what this here's 4"
As long as they're not trying 2 hurt nobody
Top of your body, let me hear U shout
U was workin' on the line
[I know U'll like that]
Soda fizzin' on the lawn
Don't let those bad boys catch u now
Everybody wants to know how the story (How the story started)
If u love somebody, your life won't be in vain
U're such a big tease, u get me all excited,
Bambi, can't you understand?
All of this and more is for you
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex
(are you ready Paris - Soul Clap)
She killed black children, and what's fair is fair
I'm fallin', baby, deeper every day
Orion's heart is bright enough
Talk of children still frightens me
I anticipate a few turbulence along the way
It only makes me want it more
Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah
Hot thing, I could read U poetry,
That's why he had 2 wait
Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows
Would U let me see U naked then?
I'm going down 2 Alphabet Street
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue
She had the cutest ass he'd ever seen
See all the people wonder why
I'm thinkin' about some of this
I say do whatever we want, wear lingerie 2 a restaurant
Purple rain Purple rain
Hey yeah!
I don't even know?
Joy - it's in the dictionary
That everything I wanna do 2 your body, baby
[verse echoed slightly off time]
It 'twas a long time coming,
Answer the 2 of life and death
Is what u need, u need to sacrifice"
Dig me now
There were people runnin' everywhere
Aristocrats on a mountain climb
No man should asunder
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby. No!
Shake! (shake,shake,shake)
It's gonna be a beautiful night (keep singin, y'all)
Can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got
Loose!
Survived 'em all baby (uh huh, say it, say it!)
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you
la la la
Worryin' about the Daddy while he beat you blind
I'm gonna be the 1 and if (u don't understand)
To the funky groove, let's make the whole house move
Everybody dance (dance), music (music),
Live 4 love - I'm calling
Atlanta, G.A. - yeah (doin' the jughead)
At the Club International Balls
(jughead)
Did U do 2 your other man the same things that U did 2 me?
U think you're special, well so do I
Honey, let's try a new position
I just want to be your friend
I wear a frown (tell me why u wanna go)
(Oh Cindy C, Oohhh, Oohhh, Oh Cindy C)
(Don't not compute)
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin'
We chill on that
Oh, Blue light
In fact u lack the knack

Ha!
vous etes tres belle, mama, girls and boys
A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with U

Whose name is self-righteousness
How will U know if I'm even in the right key
Don't take me light
That until, until the end of time
(Freaks on the floor) [repeats in BG during chorus)
Ooooo (thunder) thunder
Everybody in the east
Pheromone, when your body's wet
The love machine will put it on u right.
(International lover)
I got a lion in my pocket,
And I'm astounded that U're here
Like it's gonna be the last time
Can't stop this feeling I got
Just u and me All night
Ghettos 2 the left of us
"Gotham's greed!"
Young and old, gather 'round (yeah)
Steady wishin' he could sleep in your bed
Going down, going down, going down (goin' down)
Now!
'Till I get your daughter I won't leave this town
This is 4 the ocean, the sea, the shore
U're filthy cute and baby u know it
Then Heaven on Earth we will find
Like a frozen pond in spring
(no, no, no, no)
Ain't no good unless somebody else is in it
We've come so far in so little time
Talk 2 me baby, (talk 2 me baby)
4 all my future crimes-OH!
You used to love it when I'd do you
It's so hard to believe
I love you, I love you, can't you see?
They can hit us with all they got
I'd do anything 4 U, anything (Must be something in the water U drink)
U say u want my hips up in the air? (yeah)
The dream we all dream off
The cross
Hot thing, hot thing
Put it where it feel good
I'll never lie
How I suffer from the heat
Their 7 tears, but do not fear
Some people think I'm kinda smart
Might not know it now
Never was a reason 2 let somebody know
That I was in love with u
Would our rap have been different if we only knew?
But you never go too far
I want to live life to the ultimate high
(I want u now)
Waiting for the love to come around
(Come, Come, Come, Come, Come)
U must know failure before success
I wanna be the only one you come for
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Some people think I'm kinda cute
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
I never thought that I could feel this way
U know he had me lookin' so bad (Honey, she's so free)
Said to myself, said
Let's get nuts
Don't u stop
U left me in the dark, yes u did
The love that comes from a warm heart in a cold cold world
Systematic overthrow of the underclass
It's not a thousand years away, it's not that far my brother
I'm ready 4 the real
But deliver us from evil
Yeah, we gettin' funky in the house tonite
Are we gonna let de-elevator
Here's a reason why
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
That one's dedicated 2 all the lovers
Screamin' yo T, give me more (more)
Will peep this out, (yo, out)
Can't figure out why U make me beg
Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
U can turn the candle on.
To keep you satisfied
on it
Maybe 'bout the business u was worried
I never was the kind to make a fuss
And all it's games."
Who turn the mother out?
Birds do fly, looks like rain
Same thing that makes him wanna be a star (A double A double arrogance)
I wanna curse u baby
Now where I come from
Baby, baby, baby, baby,
Then college, the master degree
She said love me, love me, what she say?
When the 2 R in love
This is the ultimate rave
And I'm the big dipper
if u don't make that funky stand. Everybody.
Tell me, what's the matter with your world
Good mornin' ladies and gentlemen ("What hotel number is she in?")
Ooo, everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright
When all I wanna do is wrong
He said the sea would 1 day overflow with all your tears,
It gets me every time
U take them 2 your crib and u tie them 2 a chair
We've been together for quite some time
Cuz, I am the continental
When I lie awake in my boudoir (I think of u)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
(When I do, no more)
C'mon let me do ya like u want 2 be done
I need another piece of your ear
Here's what I want U 2 do
Ain't nothin' but a muffin
(Do me baby)
It feels so right
The crackle of the flame will just spoil my flow
All I really know is that u sincerely
What about New York? - yeah (get stupid, get stupid)
Flow (The space)
All night long
The longer the time, (higher) the longer the time,
The dream we all dream of
Fascinating word called love
But I only want to be with you
Little girl Wendy's parade
So I try my best to ad lib
Brother Lois should be around in a minute
(Loose!) They see U actin' like a crazy fool
Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
U think I don't?
Showed me where it's supposed to go
All I wanna feel is burning flames (hey, lover)
My flow hits u just like a lead pipe
Baby knows what 2 do
(hey now, hey now)
Round and round, round and round,
Tonight your a star
All is what we're marchin' 4
Paisley Park
I'll show my...
He's got a 57 mag with the price tag still on the side
All hail the new king in town
Pop Daddy - Daddy Pop (Oh no, my brother)
(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told ya so)
It's gonna be a beautiful night
It's time I get ig-nig-nig-nig-nig-nig-n-ignorant
Anybody can sing
This 1's 4 love without sex
Now I spend my time
And together we'll love through
Don't you blow up my world
Maybe that's the reason
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line
Which way do I turn when I'm feeling lost?
[Girl], he might do something
can I get some of that?
U gotta rock this mother
Someone over there says He wants to get to know you
Give it to me
Will make everything go wrong
But my body will never be the same
He's looking 4 some action, he's looking 4 a fight
Lay back and let my feelings show
But all I can do is just offer u my love
I'm gonna do ya like u wanna...
(Come)
Let's pretend we're married and go all night
Is such a fuckin' bore
