so the same thing I'm doing where I'm doing goal alignment within myself of these 200 biomarkers, where I'm saying, when Brian exists on a daily basis and this entity is deciding what to eat and what to do and et cetera, it's not just my conscious mind, which is opining, it's 200 biological processes and there's a whole bunch of more voices involved. So in that equation, we're going to increasingly automate the things that we spend high energy on today because it's easier. And now we're going to then negotiate the terms and conditions of intelligent life. Now we say conscious existence because we're biased because that's what we have, but it will be the largest computational exercise in history because you're now doing goal alignment with planet Earth, within yourself, with each other, within all the intelligent agents we're building, bots and other voice assistants. You basically have a trillions and trillions of agents working on the negotiation of goal alignment. Yeah, this is in fact true. And what was the second thing? That was it. So the cos
they have all the obligations and that the original person had? Do they have all the agreements that they had? I think you're gonna have to have laws that say yes. There has to be, if you wanna create a replicant, they have to have all the same rights as human rights. Well, you don't know. Someone can create a replicant and say, well, it's a replicant, but I didn't bother getting their rights. And so. Yeah, but that would be illegal, I mean. Like if you do that, you have to do that in the black market. If you wanna get an official replicant. Okay, it's not so easy. It's supposed to create multiple replicants. The original rights, maybe for one person and not for a whole group of people. Sure. So there has to be at least one. And then all the other ones kinda share the rights. Yeah, I just don't think that, that's very difficult to conceive for us humans, the idea that this country. You create a replicant that has certain, I mean, I've talked to people about this, including my wife, who would like to get back her father. And she doesn't worry about who ha
of the three were in obese individuals, one out of the three were in healthy weight individuals. And what they found is that time restricted eating in all three of those studies didn't have any advantageous benefit to sleep. It didn't necessarily harm sleep, but it didn't seem to improve it. When it comes to fasting though, which is a different state, we don't have too many studies, experimental studies with longterm fasting. The best data that we have is probably from religious practices and probably the most data we have is during Ramadan where people will fast for 29 to 30 days from sunrise to sunset. And under those conditions, there are probably five distinct changes that we've seen. None of them seem to be particularly good for sleep. The first is that the amount of melatonin that you release, and melatonin is a hormone. It's often called the hormone of darkness or the vampire hormone, not because it makes you look longingly at people's necklines, but it's just because it comes out at night. Melatonin signals to your brain and your 
e equations, that's what you get. That's always a good sign. Yes. I think I vaguely read somewhere that there may be early experimental validation of axion. Is that, am I reading the wrong? Well, there've been quite a few false alarms and I think there are some of them still, people desperately wanna find this thing. And, but I don't think any of them are convincing at this point, but there are very ambitious experiments and kind of new, you have to design new kinds of antennas that are capable of detecting these predicted particles. And it's very difficult. They interact very, very weakly. If it were easy, it would have been done already. But I think there's good hope that we can get down to the required sensitivity and actually test whether these ideas are right in coming years or maybe decades. And then understand one of the big mysteries, like literally big in terms of its fraction of the universe is dark matter. Yes. Let me ask you about, you mentioned a few times, time crystals. What are they? These things are, it's a very beautiful idea
 example, a more reliable predictor of you than they could. And that they're asking you for permission to complete their objectives and you're the one that gets to negotiate that with them and say, sure. But so it's not unimaginable that might be the case. So there's a guy named Dela Musk and he has a company in one of the many companies called Neuralink that's also excited about the brain. So it'd be interesting to hear your kind of opinions about a very different approach that's invasive, that require surgery, that implants, a data collection device in the brain. How do you think about the difference between kernel and Neuralink in the approaches of getting that stream of brain data? Elon and I spoke about this a lot early on. We met up, I had started kernel and he had an interest in brain interfaces as well. And we explored doing something together, him joining kernel and ultimately it wasn't the right move. And so he started Neuralink and I continued building kernel, but it was interesting because we were both at this very early 
he fabric of reality, like getting shortcuts, right? It might. I can't say that, you know, I can't say that it won't, but I can say that in the 1970s and early 1980s, we achieved huge steps in understanding matter. QCD, much better understanding of the weak interaction, much better understanding of quantum mechanics in general. And it's had minimal impact on technology. On rocket design, on propulsion. On rocket design, on anything, any technology whatsoever. And now we're talking about much more esoteric things. And since I don't know what they are, I can't say for sure that they won't affect technology, but I'm very, very skeptical that they would affect technology. Because, you know, to access them, you need very exotic circumstances to make new kinds of particles with high energy. You need accelerators that are very expensive and you don't produce many of them, and so forth. You know, it's just, it's a pipe dream, I think. Yeah, about space exploration. I'm not sure exactly what he has in mind, but to me, it's more a problem of, I don't know, something between biolo
a tipping point? And where are we going? I mean, like the hyena evolution, we may have understood that there's a pivotal point in their evolution. They discovered cooperation and coordination. Artificial life simulations can identify that and maybe encourage things like that. And also societies can be seen as a form of life itself. I mean, we're not talking about biological evolution, evolution of societies. Maybe some of the same phenomena emerge in that domain and having artificial life simulations and understanding could help us build better societies. Yeah, and thinking from a meme perspective of from Richard Dawkins, that maybe the organisms, ideas of the organisms, not the humans in these societies that from, it's almost like reframing what is exactly evolving. Maybe the interesting, the humans aren't the interesting thing as the contents of our minds is the interesting thing. And that's what's multiplying. And that's actually multiplying and evolving in a much faster timescale. And that maybe has more power on the trajectory of li
d say about that, but I don't want to waste my words on the failures of weak leaders. Instead, I want to say thank you to the men and women who rushed to Ground Zero to help, who put on a uniform to serve, who make me proud to be an American and a human being, and give me hope about the future of our civilization here on a small spinning rock that despite the long odds keeps kindling the fire of human consciousness and love. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Niels Jorgensen. Take me through the day of September 11th, 2001 as you experienced it, as you lived it. September 11th, 2001 was a bright, beautiful, sunny Tuesday morning. It was a late summer. There's a lot of folks who go to the beaches in New Jersey and call it the short summer. Everybody's left there for Labor Day, but it's still beautiful enough to enjoy the weather. I left my house about 6.30 in the morning and my four and a half year old daughter said to me, daddy, which truck are you driving today, the fire truck, the oil truck, or the boar's head truck? Beca
dea is not new. There's a mixture of models that's been around for a long time. But the way the brain does it is a little different. And the way it votes is different. And the kind of way it represents uncertainty is different. So we're just starting this work, but we're gonna try to see if we can sort of incorporate some of the principles of voting, or principles of the thousand brain theory. Like lots of simple models that talk to each other in a certain way. And can we build more machines, systems that learn faster and also, well mostly are multimodal and robust to multimodal type of issues. So one of the challenges there is the machine learning computer vision community has certain sets of benchmarks, sets of tests based on which they compete. And I would argue, especially from your perspective, that those benchmarks aren't that useful for testing the aspects that the brain is good at, or intelligence. They're not really testing intelligence. They're very fine. And it's been extremely useful for developing specific mathematical mode
ty in the following way. Thing number one is to realize that not only are you going to die, but your death can happen at any given moment. So for Heidegger, if you say, I know I'm going to die in some vaguely unspecified future moment, that's still death denial because you're saying, yeah, not me, not now. Heidegger's point is you need to get to the point where you need to realize that I need to realize that I can walk outside and get smote by a comet, or I can stop for gas on the way home and catch the virus and be dead in two days, or any number of potentially unanticipated and uncontrollable fatal outcomes. That's brilliant, by the way. Sorry. To bring it to the now. Yeah, it is brilliant. I agree, Lex, and that's just why I'm wondering why didn't Becker notice this? Because that's the being and time thing, is it's got to be now. And then he says, so okay, so now I've dealt somewhat with the death part. And now he says, now you've got to deal with what he calls existential guilt. And he says, well, all right, you have to realize that like it or not, 
ain. And that was when I decided I'm gonna leave my profession of computers and engineering and become a neuroscientist. Just reading that one essay from Francis Crick. I got to meet him later in life. I spoke at the Salk Institute and he was in the audience. And then I had a tea with him afterwards. He was interested in a different problem. He was focused on consciousness. The easy problem, right? Well, I think it's the red herring. And so we weren't really overlapping a lot there. Jim Watson, who's still alive, is also interested in this problem. And he was, when he was director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, he was really sort of behind moving in the direction of neuroscience there. And so he had a personal interest in this field. And I have met with him numerous times. And in fact, the last time was a little bit over a year ago, I gave a talk at Cold Spring Harbor Labs about the progress we were making in our work. And it was a lot of fun because he said, well, you wouldn't be coming here unless you had something important to 
t hasn't had its wealth destroyed over the last century. They all have a story about the inflation and the hyperinflation. And Bitcoin offers us a way out of this. And shitcoins, altcoins are essentially fiat world's last gasp attempt to try and salvage fiat, to try and salvage the idea that some people will continue to be able to print money and other people will have to use that money. You know, this is Twitter, it's a free market, it's the internet. You don't have to follow anybody, that's the thing. So what I find really objectionable about the people who are so butthurt always about Bitcoin maximalists is you don't have to click follow on people you don't like. There are 300 million Twitter accounts. And if you choose to follow the accounts that say things that annoy you and then complain about the fact that they say things that annoy you, I'm sorry, but you're an idiot that you don't know how to use Twitter. Just follow the accounts that you like. It's, you know, you don't have to be part of this. You don't have to listen to those people. Yo
, we're gonna be going back on the gold standard. 20 years later, after they went off the gold standard, they come up with this justification for why, oh, actually the gold standard was bad. And this is a really pernicious thing about it is the problems that were caused by us going off the gold standard were caused by the gold standard. And we're going to fix them by going off the gold standard even more. Just because government is lying and it's shady and it does these kinds of things doesn't mean Keynesian economics is wrong. So just, because I wanted to separate a few things you said. It could very well be very wrong and they could indeed be hucksters. All of these, such colorful language. I love you deeply for this, this is fun. Yeah, but I mean, it's like somebody like Krugman doesn't use this kind of language when discussing Austrians. It's just that when actors like him use it, it's presented as if it is legitimate because he's part of the major shows. So the case they make and the criticism Keynesians make of Austrian economics and t
our lives and we somehow grow from that. How do you think about, how do you think about that? I agree that's true. So, you know, often, you know, great artists can be also suffering from, you know, major health conditions or depression and so on. They come from abusive parents. Most great artists, I think, come from abusive parents. Yeah, that seems to be at least commonly the case, but I want to distinguish between suffering as being instrumentally good, you know, it causes people to produce good things and whether it's intrinsically good and I think intrinsically it's always bad. And so if we can produce these, you know, great achievements via some other means where, you know, if we look at the scientific enterprise, we've produced incredible things often from people who aren't suffering, have, you know, pretty good lives. They're just, they're driven instead of, you know, being pushed by a certain sort of anguish. They're being driven by intellectual curiosity. If we can instead produce a society where it's all cavet and no stick, that's better from 
rking on about a decade ago before we all got distracted by how well supervised learning was doing. So we would return we would return to the fundamentals of representation learning that really started this movement of deep learning. I think there's a lot more work that one could explore around this theme of ideas and other ideas to come up with better algorithms. So if we could return to maybe talk quickly about the specifics of deep learning.ai the deep learning specialization perhaps how long does it take to complete the course would you say? The official length of the deep learning specialization is I think 16 weeks so about four months but it's go at your own pace. So if you subscribe to the deep learning specialization there are people that finished it in less than a month by working more intensely and studying more intensely so it really depends on on the individual. When we created the deep learning specialization we wanted to make it very accessible and very affordable. And with you know Coursera and deep learni
 Bitcoin is not out there buying the expensive energy, taking energy away from people who can't afford it. It's out there buying its own energy because it doesn't need to buy the expensive energy that people really need. So one other criticism from an investment perspective, from a gambling perspective that people see is the volatility of Bitcoin. Of course, that's been somewhat decreasing over time, but what's your answer to the sort of criticism that Bitcoin is too volatile, I wanna stay away, it doesn't seem like a safe place for me to invest either short term or long term? There's no denying there's a volatility and there's a high oscillation in the value in the short term. So I think the safe way to approach that is in terms of position sizing. If the volatility bothers you, then you're overinvested perhaps. So maybe you should reduce the size of your position so that the volatility doesn't bother you. And this is the short answer that you know, like stack as much as your conviction will allow you to tolerate the volatility. And of
tson staring intently at it. And of course there with, whatever, 60 years earlier, he was standing pointing at the double helix. That's one of the great discoveries in all of, whatever, biology, science, all science and DNA. So it's funny that there's echoes of that in your presentation. Do you think, in terms of evolutionary timeline and history, the development of the neocortex was a big leap? Or is it just a small step? So like, if we ran the whole thing over again, from the birth of life on Earth, how likely would we develop the mechanism of the neocortex? Okay, well those are two separate questions. One is, was it a big leap? And one was how likely it is, okay? They're not necessarily related. Maybe correlated. Maybe correlated, maybe not. And we don't really have enough data to make a judgment about that. I would say definitely it was a big leap. And I can tell you why. I don't think it was just another incremental step. I don't get that at the moment. I don't really have any idea how likely it is. If we look at evolution, we have one data point, wh
rd him on Clubhouse three nights ago, but that was three nights ago. But I think he's far too pessimistic about the impact of immigration on U.S. science. He thinks it has displaced U.S. scientists, which I think that is partly true. I just think we've gotten better talent. I'm like, bring it on, double down. And look at Kiriko, who basically came up with mRNA vaccines, she was from Hungary. And was ridiculed and mocked, she couldn't get her papers published. She stuck at it. An American might not have been so stubborn because we have these cushions. So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in, they're discouraging native U.S. citizens from doing math. I'm like, bring in the best people. If we all end up in other avocations, absolutely fine by me. Does it trouble you that we kick them out after they get a degree often? I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree a green card, universally. Yeah, I agree with that, it makes no sense. It makes so strange that the best people that come here suffer here, create awesome stuff here, then w
think that are really going on. One is the design, manufacturing, and distribution of intelligence is heading towards zero on a cost curve over a certain design, over a certain timeframe that our ability to, you know, evolution produced us an intelligent form of intelligence. We are now designing our own intelligence systems and the design, manufacturing, distribution of that intelligence over a certain timeframe is going to go to a cost of zero. Design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligence cost is going to zero. For example. Again, just give me a second. That's brilliant, okay. And evolution is doing the design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligence. And now we are doing the design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligence. And the cost of that is going to zero. That's a very nice way of looking at life on Earth. So if that's going on and then now in parallel to that, then you say, okay, what then happens if when that cost curve is heading to zero? Our existence becomes a goal alignment problem, a goal alignment function. And 
e of these problems have a genetic component and an environment component. And so like when there's a genetic component, what can we do about some of these diseases? And have you worked on what can you say that's in terms of problems that are solvable here or understandable? So my group works on the genetic component, but I would argue that understanding the genetic component can have a huge impact even on the environmental component. Why is that? Because genetics gives us access to mechanism. And if we can alter the mechanism, if we can impact the mechanism, we can perhaps counteract some of the environmental components. So understanding the biological mechanisms leading to disease is extremely important in being able to intervene. But when you can intervene and what, you know, the analogy that I like to give is for example, for obesity, you know, think of it as a giant bathtub of fat. There's basically fat coming in from your diet and there's fat coming out from your exercise. Okay. So that's an in out equation and that's the equati
g is just being heard. My state of mind, the level of focus, all those kinds of things, being heard. What I heard you say is you have an entirety of lived experience, some of which you can communicate in words and in body language, some of which you feel internally, which cannot be captured in those communication modalities, and that this measurement system captures both the things you can try to articulate in words, maybe in a lower dimensional space, using one word, for example, to communicate focus, when it really may be represented in a 20 dimensional space of this particular kind of focus and that this information is being captured, so it's a closer representation to the entirety of your experience captured in a dynamic fashion that is not just a static image of your conscious experience. Yeah, that's the promise, that was the feeling, and it felt like the future. So it was a pretty cool experience. And from the sort of mechanical perspective, it was cool to have an actual device that feels pretty good, that doesn't require me to g
istraction? It's a way to sell a flawed technology? The problem with dApps is, I mean, it's just the economics of it makes no sense in the sense that currently, if you wanted to run an application, whatever the application is, you want to run it on AWS, you pay a specific amount of money, you want to run it on your own laptop, you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte of data. If you wanted to run the same thing on a distributed ledger, where you're distributing the data over thousands of computers worldwide, it's infinitely more expensive. And that's why we haven't seen any of these dApps take off. And that's why I've said this many years ago, the only working application of blockchain technology is Bitcoin. Because with Bitcoin, you know, with a few hundred bytes of data, with a few bytes of data, you could move a billion dollars worth of economic value from here to China and move it safely and reliably. So that power, I can't see it being justified for anything that is not as mission critical, as moving large amounts of value, which 
en I first read The Denial of Death, I was so literally flabbergasted by it that I took a leave of absence for a year and just like did what would be considered menial jobs. I did construction work. I worked in a restaurant. And I was just like, well, wait a minute. If I understand what this guy is saying, then I'm just a culturally constructed meat puppet doing things for reasons that I know not in order to assuage death anxiety. And I was like, that's not acceptable. Maybe another interesting person to talk about is Ernest Becker himself. So how did he face his death? Is there something interesting, personal? I think so. So interesting to me is Becker also from a Jewish family, claimed to be the atheistic, did not identify ultimately as Jewish. I believe he converted to Christianity, but was himself a religious person. And he said he became religious when his first child was born. Now religious, what does that mean? Does he have a faith? Well, let's talk more. Most importantly, is the afterlife. What's his view on the afterlife? He was agno
 and rules and so on and becomes something else entirely that doesn't make sense in the same way that David might. I think a lot of it is phenomenal. And I would say the single biggest mistake that really smart people make is to think contemporary art or music for that matter is just a load of junk or rubbish. It's just like a kind of mathematics they haven't learned yet. It's really hard to learn. Maybe some people can never learn it, but there's a very large community of super smart, well educated people who spend their lives with it, who love it. Those are genuine pleasures. They understand it. They talk about it with the common language. And to think that somehow they're all frauds, it just isn't true. Like one doesn't have to like it oneself, just like Love House may or may not be your thing, but it is amazing and for me personally, highly rewarding. And if someone doesn't get it, I do kind of have the conceited response of thinking like in that area, I'm just smarter than you are. Yeah, so the interesting thing is as with most... We get 
fferent than rural. Britain and New York is different than Iowa. You start to notice things. I mean, you don't want to generalize, there's all kinds of people everywhere, but there's a certain way of communication on crypto, Twitter in general, but also Bitcoin maximalists that I even early on received a bunch of heat. I was like, what the hell? So listen, there's definitely a difference when I go to the computer science community, the machine learning community, it's way friendlier than the cryptocurrency community. I have much more freedom to actually be what I enjoy being, which is asking simple dumb questions. Even when I've already spent years, sometimes decades with an idea, I like asking dumb questions anyway. The crypto folks punish you for this, for curiosity, for exploration. I understand the mechanism because so many other people come into that community and they might masquerade as curious, but really they're trying to inject, they're trying to sell some kind of altcoin, there's some scheme, there's some scheme to make money. And so I
ction. And what Dawkins says is he thought about it in terms of just that we could do mental simulations, that one possibly extraordinary product of consciousness is to rather than find out often by adverse consequences through trying something would be to run mental simulations. And so one possibility is that consciousness is highly adaptive. Another possibility is Nicholas Humphrey, a British dude who wrote a book about, I think it's I would argue forcefully that we know a lot more than we used to. I would argue equally forcefully, but not that I have a PhD in the philosophy of science, but I believe that the Thomas Kuhns of the world are right when they point out that change is not necessarily progress. And so on the one hand, I do think we know a lot more than we did back in the day when if you wanted to fly, you put on some wax wings and jumped off a mountain. On the other hand, I think it's quite arrogant when scientists, I'll just speak about psychological scientists, when they have the audacity to mistake statistical pr
nd gets through the first layer, we treat it in a second, third, fourth layer. So it's a mechanical engineering problem. Yeah, that's what I said. So it's not, there's no weird tricks to it, like a chemistry type thing. No, no. Just, well, the right squishiness, you need the right material inside. And ours look like little springs, but they're. Springs? They're springs? So like legitimately, like shock absorbers. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay. And this is now experimental physics at the, at its limit. Okay. So you do this and we make the world's fanciest shock absorbers, just mechanical engineering. Just mechanical engineering, this is hilarious. But we didn't, we weren't good enough to discover gravitational waves. So we did another, we added another feature and it's something else that you're aware of, probably have one. And that is to get rid of noise. You've probably noise, which is, you don't like. And that's the same principle that's in these little Bose earphones. Noise canceling? Noise canceling. So how do they work? They basically, you go on an airplane and they sense
we had basically this roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the human epigenome, the largest map of the human epigenome that has ever been built across 127 different tissues and samples with dozens of epigenomic marks measured in hundreds of donors. So what we've basically learned through that is that you basically can map what are the active gene regulatory elements for every one of the tissues in the body. And then we connected these gene regulatory active maps of basically what regions of the human genome are turning on in every one of different tissues. We then can go back and say, where are all of the genetic loci that are associated with disease? This is something that my group, I think was the first to do back in 2010 in this Ernst Nature Biotech paper, but basically we were for the first time able to show that specific chromatin states, specific epigenomic states, in that case enhancers, were in fact enriched in disease associated variants. We pushed that further in the Ernst Nature paper a year later. And then in this r
u know, 100 pages into the other when you finish the first one. But it is a, it is a, it's a journey, it's a process. I don't think it is a, in fact, I think it's very dangerous to think that way. To think, oh, this, I'm gonna win the Oscar, you know? It's interesting. For the creative process, it might be dangerous. It's a, maybe you can, like, why is that dangerous? Because I kind of know where you're coming from. Because it's the ego. It's the ego. Because you're giving yourself over to the ego. You know, I keep saying this myself. My job, I'm a servant of the muse. I'm there to do what she tells me to do. And if I suddenly think, oh, I'm really, I just wanna, you know, whatever, the muse doesn't like that. And, you know, and she's on another dimension from me. I'm trying to square that, because I agree. I'm trying to square that with the, I think there's a meditation to visualizing success in the athletic realm, to where it focuses, it removes everything else away, to where you focus on this particular battle. I mean, I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways. And i
 game, and the difference is is that what's at stake. So all things are a game of some sort and you're putting up for it or what you're willing to put up for it determines whether or not you're going to participate or not. And all aspects of any game is war and it's just, what is at stake? If it's your life, it's a different story. If it's just a coin, it's another thing. A nice way to put it is if humans play a game in this kind of pursuit of creating, whatever the hell the reason is that we keep creating cooler and cooler things, it seems to be the result of a game that we naturally play, we naturally crave. I don't know, I mean, that's been the struggle of philosophy is to understand what is the underlying force of all that. Is it the will to power? I think will to power is a really great way of describing it. Do you want to be the winner of the game? No, not just, no, I don't look at will to power as being the winner of the game. Well, I mean, if we're going to get philosophical, yes, you want to be the winner of the game. What does winning the 
ivity in the brain. And there's very strong evidence that you're doing more of inference on one part of the phase, and more of learning on the other part of the phase. So the brain can actually sort of separate different populations of cells or going back and forth like this. But in general, I would say that's an important problem. We have all of our networks that we've come up with do both. And they're continuous learning networks. And you mentioned benchmarks earlier. Well, there are no benchmarks about that. So we have to, we get in our little soapbox, and hey, by the way, this is important, and here's a mechanism for doing that. But until you can prove it to someone in some commercial system or something, it's a little harder. So yeah, one of the things I had to linger on that is in some ways to learn the concept of a coffee cup, you only need this one coffee cup and maybe some time alone in a room with it. Well, the first thing is, imagine I reach my hand into a black box and I'm reaching, I'm trying to touch something. I don't know upfron
r, much better. It's still a metaphor, though. But you can read it just as a story about a guy catching a fish, and it's still fun to read. I had the same experience as you, not with Moby Dick, but later in college, I took a course on James Joyce. Don't ask me why. I was majoring in computer science, I took a course on James Joyce. And I was kept being told that he is widely considered, by many considered, to be the greatest literary writer of the 20th century. And I kept reading, I think, so his short story is The Dead, I think it's called. It was very good. Well, not very good, but pretty good. And then Ulysses. It's actually very good. It is very good. Only The Dead, the final story, it still rings with me today. But then Ulysses was, I got through Ulysses with the help of some Cliff Notes and so on. And so I did Ulysses and then Finnegan's Wake. The moment I started Finnegan's Wake, I said, this is stupid. That's when I went full into like, I don't know, that's when I went full Kafka, Bukowski, like people who just talk about the darkness of the human cond
or else we get very upset and that's an amazing thing if you think about it. And it's telling us that we do understand a lot about nature at a very profound level and there are still things we don't understand of course but as we get better and better answers and better and better ability to address difficult questions we can ask more and more ambitious questions. Well, I guess the hope part of that is because we are surrounded by mystery. So one way to say it, if you look at the growth GDP over time that we figured out quite a lot and we're able to improve the quality of life because of that and we've figured out some fundamental things about this universe but we still don't know how much mystery there is and it's also possible that there's some things that are in fact incomprehensible to both our minds and the tools of science. Like the sad thing is we may not know it because in fact they are incomprehensible and that's the open question is how much of the universe is comprehensible? If we figured out everything what's insi
magined in your mind is as broad as possible, as global as possible. So really try to reach as many people interested in machine learning and AI as possible. I really want to help anyone that had an interest in machine learning to break into the field. And I think sometimes I've actually had people ask me, hey, why are you spending so much time explaining gradient descent? And my answer was, if I look at what I think the learner needs and what benefit from, I felt that having that a good understanding of the foundations coming back to the basics would put them in a better stead to then build on a long term career. So try to consistently make decisions on that principle. So one of the things you actually revealed to the narrow AI community at the time and to the world is that the amount of people who are actually interested in AI is much larger than we imagined. By you teaching the class and how popular it became, it showed that, wow, this isn't just a small community of sort of people who go to NeurIPS and it's much bigger. It's
e driving, but I loved it. So for people who are just listening, you're kind of a big guy. Well, yeah, I definitely need to lose about 50 pounds. No, I don't mean in that way, your frame, big hands. As my beloved friend, Bobby Adams would say to me, I was driving around in a clown wagon and he also says, I have a waving hairdo, waving bye bye. So thanks, Bobby. But yeah, he's a great friend. Yeah, so I took the Volkswagen and I flew in and I was heading over to Verrazano Bridge and hit the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. And my phone rang and my wife normally doesn't curse or raise a voice and she was yelling at me. And she said, don't go in there, go to your firehouse. Well, first she asked, well, she knew I was on the way, but she just wanted to know where. And I said, I'm on the curve, which is 65th Street on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway called Dead Man's Curve. We actually used to do a lot of car wrecks up there. And I was hitting that curve pretty fast. And then right around the curve is the exit to the firehouse. And I had to decide, well, am I driving r
dio station. And another way of looking at it, this is an, did you ever see the movie City of Angels? The visual of the movie, it was Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage. Yeah, yeah, I've seen it, yep. And right, the visual of the movie sort of was Meg Ryan is a heart surgeon. And as she's operating on somebody, suddenly Nicolas Cage in this long duster coat, like Jesse James, appears right next to her in the operating room, and he's an angel. And he's waiting to take out the soul of the patient on the operating table. And she doesn't see him, she's totally unaware of him. And so is everybody else in the operating room, except maybe the guy who's about to die, who suddenly sees him. But I kind of believe that there are beings like that, or if you don't like that, it's a force, it's a consciousness, it's something that are right here, right now. And they're trying to communicate to us. And like through a membrane, like tapping on that window over there, they're like right out there. And they carry the future. They are everything that is in potential. All the works th
ting and it's very appealing, but biologists just like to decouple that complexity experimentally, to just like peel off layers of complexity experimentally. And that's what many of these modern tools that my group and others have both developed and used. The fact that we can now figure out tricks for peeling off these layers of complexity by testing one cell type at a time or by testing one cell at a time. And you could basically say, what is the effect of these genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's on human brain? Human brain sounds like, oh, it's an organ, of course, just go one organ at a time. But human brain has of course, dozens of different brain regions and within each of these brain regions, dozens of different cell types and every single type of neuron, every single type of glial cell between astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, between all of the neural cells and the vascular cells and the immune cells that are co inhabiting the brain between the different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are 
n is over the, are we willing to murder each other over Netflix versus murder each other over water? We're willing to murder each other over water. That's a given. Right, but that's our animalistic selves. Well, it's also a necessity for, it's animalistic, but it's also either you do it or you don't, right? Like unless somebody's willing to share that water or if that water is of such a limited capability or such a limited amount, then you will have to murder to have that water. Netflix, the argument is the higher, we get up to this hierarchy of what we consider in Los Angeles resources, we're less willing to be, to commit violence. We're less willing to commit violence, I would say over Netflix, but we are willing to commit violence over Netflix, over everything associated with Netflix, over televisions, over sneakers, over, you know, I mean, when we look at a good, I mean, the majority of the stuff that came with the riots, I mean, it was used car dealerships, targets. I mean, and then you look and it's like, well, okay, well, what are people, what do they
ay and prosper. And they fought and died alongside of strangers. And it's sort of symbolic of what happened that day. And then strangers from around this great country just flocked in by the thousands to help. They didn't know who was in that pile, but they didn't care. That was another American. And what I ultimately am trying to do involved in this beautiful project is spread the message of doing the right thing. Look at these examples. These brave people who didn't have to, especially the civilians, they weren't paid to run back in there and help person after person. And they had no obligation. They could have just said, hey man, I'm out of here and just bolted. But they didn't. So we're just trying to say to people, let's bring back that unity and that feeling of 912. As strange as 912 of a day it was, it was so sad because it was the first dawn of the sun where we realized this wasn't a dream. This was real and it's not going away. But the beauty of it was there was thousands of people lined up along the West Side Highway with signs and Ameri
nna get sick. And I wasn't feeling well from 2008 on, I couldn't put my finger on it, but I just wasn't right. And in 2011, I failed my medical, my bloods came back horrifically wrong and they pulled me off the truck, but they strung me out for a month, the doctors in the fire department, one of them said my spleen was engorged because I was probably drinking myself to death, like as he said, most of the guys did after 9 11, which was pretty wrong of him and stereotypical, just to stereotype and to categorize and guy couldn't have cared less, he just, he was so crude and nasty. And then my one doctor who was my doctor on the outside, my blood pressure was 240 over 140, my spleen was about to rupture, she didn't even show up for my appointment and I went down, passed out, the paramedics responded, she got into an argument with a paramedic because for big ego and basically telling him there wasn't really anything wrong and he's looking at my paperwork going, this guy's got leukemia and he overrode her, he raced me out of there down to Brooklyn Methodist and t
ough all the six phases of reality. That's a good way to look at it. It does make some point to the whole value of having a universe. Do you think about your own mortality? Are you afraid of it? Yes, but I keep going back to my idea of being able to expand human life quickly enough in advance of our getting there, longevity escape velocity, which we're not quite at yet, but I think we're actually pretty close, particularly with, for example, doing simulated biology. I think we can probably get there within, say, by the end of this decade, and that's my goal. Do you hope to achieve the longevity escape velocity? Do you hope to achieve immortality? Well, immortality is hard to say. I can't really come on your program saying I've done it. I've achieved immortality because it's never forever. A long time, a long time of living well. But we'd like to actually advance human life expectancy, advance my life expectancy more than a year every year, and I think we can get there within, by the end of this decade. How do you think we'd do it? So there's practic
trace it in families with cases and not cases, cases, not cases, and so on and so forth. But so these are the genes that everybody says, oh, that's the genes we should go after because that's a strong effect gene. I like to think about it slightly differently. These are the genes where genetic impacts that have a strong effect were tolerated because every single time we have a genetic association with disease, it depends on two things. Number one, the obvious one, whether the gene has an impact on the disease. Number two, the more subtle one is whether there is genetic variation standing and circulating and segregating in the human population that impacts that gene. Some genes are so darn important that if you mess with them, even a tiny little amount, that person's dead. So those genes don't have variation. You're not going to find a genetic association if you don't have variation. That doesn't mean that the gene has no role. It simply means that the gene tolerates no mutations. So that's actually a strong signal when there's no variation
hing, you would prefer to take it now because then you'd get to enjoy it over the next 10 years. So we always prefer the present to the future. There's always a discount on the future. And that discount is called time preference. The degree to which we prefer the present to the future is called our time preference. So the higher our time preference, the less we care about the future. And the process of civilization is the process of lowering our time preference, where we start caring more for the future, we start prioritizing the present less and less. So we start being able to not consume everything that we have and store it. And so money is essential for that. And under the gold standard, everyone in the world had the ability to provide for their future by simply using the same money that they use. You would work a day and you would get paid in a gold coin and you could take that gold coin and keep it safe for 10 years and know that at the end of those 10 years, that gold coin would buy you slightly more than what it bought you th
e affection for them, even the bad guys. Maybe especially the bad guys. Especially the bad guys. You've said that writers, even successful writers, are often not tough minded enough. I've read that in the post, that you have to be a professional in the way you handle your emotions. You have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writer. So what do you think makes a warrior? Is a warrior born or trained in the realm, in the bigger realm, in the realm of writing, in the creative process? I think they're born to some extent. You have the gift, like you might have the gift as a martial artist to do whatever martial artists do, but the training is the big thing. 90% training, 10%, 10% genetics. And, you know, I use another analogy other than warrior as far as writer, and that's like to be a mother. If you think about, if you're a writer or any creative person, you're giving birth to something, right, you're carrying a new life inside you. And in terms of bravery, if your child, your two year old child is underneath a car that's coming down the street, the mother's gonna 
and over and over again and wealth increases, increases, increases, increases in terms of the things that we're able to acquire, right? I mean, I've seen homeless people with smartphones, you know, so we're living in the most wealth laden, luxury laden age of all of humanity yet. What happens when we see calamity or people go on hard time? What are the things that they value? You know, what do people go to an argument about the cost of things that are luxury items generally and not necessity items? You know, we get into fights about things that are at the end of the day, not necessities to us. You know, people are so concerned about Netflix and the internet and personally, I'm very concerned about the internet because I look at it as my own little personal library of Alexandria in my pocket. That's what I love about it. And the ability to have a tool as effective as it is, even though I'm in a constant battle to not let that tool become a vice or to become something that actually brings me to a lower state. But are we willing, the questio
government. It is oriented toward consumer services. The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages. Business is great at getting things done. USA is fundamentally a nation of business and that makes us a nation of opportunity. So I am indeed mostly a fan. Subject to numerous caveats. What's the con? What are some negative downsides of capitalism in your view or some things that we should be concerned about maybe for longterm impacts of capitalism? Again, capitalism takes a different form in each country. I would say in the United States, our weird blend of whatever you want to call it has had an enduring racial problem from the beginning, has been a force of taking away land from Native Americans and oppressing them pretty much from the beginning. It has done very well by immigrants for the most part. We revel in championitarian creative destruction more. So we don't just prop up national champions forever. And there's a precariousness to life for some people here that is less so say in Germany or the Netherlands. We have 
y. It feels like you have to be a conscious being. But then we don't even know what consciousness is and we certainly don't know how to engineer it in our machines. I love the fact that there are still questions The first is that I had to really address what was stressful and try to come up with some degree of meaningful rationality around it. Because I think one of the things that happens, there's something very, talking about conscious states, to come all the way back to, gosh, I don't know, I feel like we've only been chatting for like 20 minutes, but you're gonna tell me it's been a while. Yeah, it's been a while. Okay, I'm desperately, I feel terribly sorry. But let's come back to conscious states, which is where we started. There is something very strange about the night that thoughts and anxieties are not the same as they are in the waking day. They are worse, they are bigger. And I at least find that I am far more likely to catastrophize and ruminate at night about things that when I wake up the next day in the broad light of day, I th
ccurs in quantum mechanics where the primary description of the world is in terms of wave functions. But let's not talk about the world. Let's just talk about a particle, an electron. The primary description of that electron is its wave function. And the wave function can be used to predict where it's gonna be. If you observe, it'll be in different places with different probabilities or how fast it's moving. And it'll also be moving in different ways with different probabilities. That's what quantum mechanics says. And you can predict either set of probabilities if you know what's gonna happen if I make an observation of the position or the velocity. So the wave function gives you ways of doing both of those. But to do it, to get those predictions, you have to process the wave function in different ways. You process it one way for position and in a different way for momentum. And those ways are mathematically incompatible. It's like you have a stone and you can sculpt it into a Venus de Milo or you can sculpt it into David, but you can
, right? But there's so much drama. The Florentine artists, of course there's drama and small groups tend to split up, which is fine, just like entering relationships off an end. But it's remarkable how little has been done that was not done in small groups in some way. So speaking of loss of beautiful relationships, where do you make this whole love thing? Why do humans fall in love? What's the role of love, friendship, family in life? In a successful life or just life in general? Why the hell are we so into this thing? There are multiple layers of understanding that question. So kind of the lowest layer is the Darwinian answer, right? If we weren't this way, we wouldn't have been successful in reproducing and building alliances. It's important to realize that's far from complete. Sort of the highest understanding would be poetic, like read John Keats or many other love poets. So who do I go to to find out, to learn about love in terms of poets or? I would say start with John Keats. But given that you're fluent in Russian. Yeah, let's go Russian 
body that it's dark, it's nighttime, and it's time to sleep. Those individuals, when they were undergoing that regimen of fasting, the amount of melatonin that was released and when it was released, the amount of melatonin decreased and when it was released came later. That was the first thing. The second thing was that they ended up finding it harder to fall asleep as quickly as they normally would otherwise. The third thing was that the total amount of sleep that they were getting decreased. The fourth fascinating thing was that a wake promoting chemical called orexin increased. And this is why a lot of people will say, when I'm fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer and I'm more alert, I'm more active. And I'll come back from an evolutionary perspective why we understand that to be the case. And then the fourth factor is that fasting didn't decrease the amount of deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected. It did, however, decrease the amount of REM sleep or dream sleep. And we know that REM sleep dreaming is essential for e
 this consciousness will emerge. I mean, definitely it will display behavior which we will interpret as conscious. And then it's a philosophical question. Did this consciousness really emerge or is it a zombie which just, you know, fakes everything? We still don't have to figure that out. Although it may be interesting, at least from a philosophical point of view, it's very interesting, but it may also be sort of practically interesting. You know, there's some people saying, if it's just faking consciousness and feelings, you know, then we don't need to be concerned about, you know, rights. But if it's real conscious and has feelings, then we need to be concerned, yeah. I can't wait till the day where AI systems exhibit consciousness because it'll truly be some of the hardest ethical questions of what we do with that. It is rather easy to build systems which people ascribe consciousness. And I give you an analogy. I mean, remember, maybe it was before you were born, the Tamagotchi? Yeah. Freaking born. How dare you, sir? Why, that's the, you're young, rig
 human beings can see our identity. One is the ego, the conscious ego, and the other is the greater self. And the self in the Jungian sense, the self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious and butts up against what Jung called the divine ground, which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever. And I think, and the ego is just this little dot inside this bigger self. And the ego has a completely different view of life from the self. The ego believes, I'm gonna give you a long answer here. No, perfect. The ego believes that death is real. The ego believes that time and space are real. The ego believes that each one of us is separate from the other. I'm separate from you. If I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me, it would only hurt you. And in the ego's world, the dominant emotion is fear because we were all made of flesh. We can all die. We can all be hurt. We can all be ruined. So we are protecting ourselves and even our desire to create, as we were talking about before, comes out of that fear of death. The se
hink it was insane, but it was that sort of warrior archetype that we were talking about before that, that generational testosterone eros thing. Whereas nowadays, I don't know. I mean, it's hard to say there's not gonna be another war because there always are, but it's sort of hard to imagine people getting off their ass these days to do anything. Well, it's funny that you mentioned social media as a place for empathy, sure. But in a sense, it's a place for war as well. For hatred, yeah, true. For hatred. And perhaps the positive aspect of hatred on social media is that it's somewhat less harmful than murder. And so it kind of dissipates sort of the hatefuls. You get the hate out at a less, on a daily basis and thereby never boils up to a point where you want to kill. It's also a really weird thing that's going on that I don't know if anybody really understands, like with video games where kids are acting out these incredible horror things, right? But you know that if they cut their finger, they would like freak out, you know? And I also don't th
things which we find enjoyment, but aren't really clearly survival characteristics. And that it seems to only have happened in humans, to the large extent. And so that's what's going on, where we sort of have, we've sort of escaped the gravity of evolutionary pressure, in some sense, in the neocortex. And it now does things which are not, that are really interesting, discovering models of the universe, which may not really help us. Does it matter? How does it help us surviving, knowing that there might be multiverses, or that there might be the age of the universe, or how do various stellar things occur? It doesn't really help us survive at all. But we enjoy it, and that's what happened. Or at least not in the obvious way, perhaps. It is required, if you look at the entire universe in an evolutionary way, it's required for us to do interplanetary travel, and therefore survive past our own sun. But you know, let's not get too. Yeah, but evolution works at one time frame, it's survival, if you think of survival of the phenotype, survival of the individ
 of love and peace and harmony and so forth. That's how they describe God. So that's my view of God, not as a person in the sky that you can make deals with. It's whatever the magic that goes from basic elements to things like consciousness and love. Do you think one of the things I find extremely beautiful and powerful is cellular automata, which you also touch on? Do you think whatever the heck happens in cellular automata where interesting, complicated objects emerge, God is in there too? The emergence of love in this seemingly primitive universe? Well, that's the goal of creating a replicant is that they would love you and you would love them. There wouldn't be much point of doing it if that didn't happen. But all of it, I guess what I'm saying about cellular automata is it's primitive building blocks and they somehow create beautiful things. Is there some deep truth to that about how our universe works? Is the emergence from simple rules, beautiful, complex objects can emerge? Is that the thing that made us? Yeah, well. As we went thr
k against it and cancel it. This is awesome. So you have the actuators and you have the thing that is sensing the, the vibrations and then you have the actual actuators that adjust for that and do so in perfect synchrony. Yeah. What if it all works right. And so how much do we reduce the shaking of the earth? I mean, one part in 10 to the 12th. One part in 10. So what gets through us is one part in 10 to the 12th. That's pretty big reduction. You don't need that in your car, but that's what we do. And so that's how isolated we are from the earth. And that was the biggest, and that was the biggest, I'd say technical problem outside of the physics instrument, the interferometer. Can I ask you a weird question here? You make it very poetically and humorously is saying it's just a mechanical engineering problem, but is this one of the biggest precision mechanical engineering efforts ever? I mean, this seems exceptionally difficult. It is. And so it took a long time. And I think nobody seems to challenge the statement that this is the most precision, preci
but in the world, the good people outnumber the assholes. Oh, I agree. And there's days when I think the assholes are overrunning us, but you know what? I think what the downfall of the world is is ego and arrogance and people that think they're better than that other guy. My parents raised me to be this way. My mom is such a sweet, gentle soul. She's an immigrant. She came here at 16 years old. She helps everybody but herself, right? She's just one of those people. She's sick. She's got Parkinson's. You'd never know it. And she's still flying around her condo complex helping everybody because that's what she does. She loves to help people. But she's been in their shoes. She's been poor. She's sick. Her husband was sick. She's had all sorts of suffering and loss in her life. My granddad died when my mom was 10 and she was one of 10 children that survived out of 14. She knows hard times, but she so appreciates the good times and the goodness of this country. You know, the fire department and the police department, military, it taught me a lot about empathy and t
h it's this uniform sheet of cells, different parts of it project to other parts, which project to other parts. And there is a sort of rough hierarchy in terms of that. So the hierarchical temporal memory is just saying, look, we should be thinking about the brain as time based, model memory based, and hierarchical processing. And that was a placeholder for a bunch of components that we would then plug into that. We still believe all those things I just said, but we now know so much more that I'm stopping to use the word hierarchical temporal memory yet because it's insufficient to capture the stuff we know. So again, it's not incorrect, but it's, I now know more and I would rather describe it more accurately. Yeah, so you're basically, we could think of HTM as emphasizing that there's three aspects of intelligence that are important to think about whatever the eventual theory it converges to. So in terms of time, how do you think of nature of time across different time scales? So you mentioned things changing, sensory inputs changing ev
like stop a Buick, you know, with her bare hands. So that's another way to think about how a writer has to think about, or any creative person has to think about, I think, what they're doing, what this child, this new creation that they're bringing forth. Yeah, so the hard work that's underlying that. I've just, a couple weeks ago, talked to, just happened to be in the same room, both gave talks, Arianna Huffington. I did this conversation with her. I didn't know much about her before then, but she has recently been, she wrote a couple books and been promoting a lifestyle where she basically, she created the Huffington Post, and she gave herself like, I don't know, 20 hours a day just obsessed with her work. And then she fainted, passed out, and kind of, there was some health issues. And so she wrote this book saying that, you know, sleep, basically you wanna establish a lifestyle that doesn't sacrifice health, that's productive but doesn't sacrifice health. She thinks that you can have both, productivity and health. Criticizing Elon Musk, who I've also spok
an show that other people, machine learning people should pay attention to these ideas. Then we're definitely in an under 20 year timeframe. If I can do those things, if I'm not successful in that, and this is the last time anyone talks to me and no one reads our papers and you know, and I'm wrong or something like that, then I don't know. But it's not 50 years. Think about electric cars. How quickly are they gonna populate the world? It probably takes about a 20 year span. It'll be something like that. But I think if I can do what I said, we're starting it. And of course there could be other, you said step functions. It could be everybody gives up on your ideas for 20 years and then all of a sudden somebody picks it up again. Wait, that guy was onto something. Yeah, so that would be a failure on my part, right? Think about Charles Babbage. Charles Babbage, he's the guy who invented the computer back in the 18 something, 1800s. And everyone forgot about it until 100 years later. And say, hey, this guy figured this stuff out a long time ago. But he was ahead of his
tleman named Bad Jack Carroll and Jack was an airborne ranger and my father in law was also on the department and he knew Jack. And Jack came home, Jack jumped Normandy and stormed up through the Battle of the Bulls in Bastogne and he came back, greatest generation as they all did and they got jobs and they went right to work and they were treated better back then, vets, right? And he got on the New York City Fire Department and he got assigned a ladder 114 and they first got radios back then and when Jack, he would drive the truck, you're up there with the officer, either the lieutenant or captain, so if the boss is off the truck, you operate the radio for them as the driver. So when they called him and they'd say, you know, ladder 114 responding to 52nd Street, 3rd Avenue, Structure Fire, you're supposed to get back and say, ladder 114, 10 four, but he refused to do that. He'd say, ladder 114, Tally Ho, because that's what they'd yell when they'd jump out the plane. So all these years later, it stuck and it's a little bit of a bragging right, but out of 350 eng
e conflicts are not just isolated to one on one. If it's four on two, your buddy that was with you back to back, And perhaps, I think, maybe that is what was... Yeah, somehow more honest, perhaps. I mean, there's also the aspect of rebelliousness, usually. Like, I was never one to wanna just do what somebody told me to do, you know? I'm not sitting around trying to always be such a radical individual that I can't take orders. No, in fact, I'm more than willing to take orders from somebody that I feel is competent and has merit and reason behind what they're doing and makes like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm 100% for it. Not only can I take orders, I will help you achieve whatever it is if I think it's worthwhile, even at my own expense. But to get to that point is a rarity. Like, it's just not a given. And so you can even imagine being a grade school teacher and this kid doesn't respect you and he doesn't really think you're that smart. They don't really appreciate that. So cyberpunk is number one. What else is there? Cyberpunk is kind of number one. It's an envir
d it turns out that you can do better in each of these tasks when you are learning simultaneously other tasks than you would by one task alone. Which is a fascinating idea in itself, yeah. Yes, and people do that all the time. I mean, you use knowledge of domains that you know in new domains, and certainly neural network can do that. When neuroevolution comes in is that, what's the best way to combine these tasks? Now there's architectural design that allow you to decide where and how the embeddings, the internal representations are combined and how much you combine them. And there's quite a bit of research on that. And my team, Elliot Meyerson has worked on that in particular, like what is a good internal representation that supports multiple tasks? And we're getting to understand how that's constructed and what's in it, so that it is in a space that supports multiple different heads, like you said. And that I think is fundamentally how biological intelligence works as well. You don't build a representation just for one task. You try t
start getting injected when you start talking about other layers built on top of Bitcoin, when you start talking about applications or different things like lightning network, that's where the curiosity can emerge. But still, that's why with cryptocurrency in general, I just try to keep an open mind. And just the shit coin as a term is just a good statement that I'm gonna close my mind to. That's the way I hear it. But coming out of your mouth, because you say a lot of other edgy stuff, it's just more you having fun. That's the way I hear it. But if I said something like that, I would feel like I'm closing my mind. I mean, let me give you the counter argument to that. How much time do you spend emailing back all of these Nigerian Prince email scams that you know email you tell you, send me $5,000 and I'll send you $15 million? None. None. Why are you being close minded to all of these great ideas? Well, no, but I'm also... You know, maybe one of them will actually send you $15 million. But I don't know if I know the difference between the Nigerian Prince and

The Supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. now he's on his back. What do you think? And now it's gonna be one on one while three go on one. So, and then you elevate this to armored combat, right? And it's boom, put them on the ground. Oh, crap, it's hard to get up. Well, while you're struggling to get up, stab. That's where jujitsu's concepts come from with all their leveraging and off balancing is, oh man, if I end up in this situation in tight close quarters combat, yes, we could fight it out with swords and knives and what have you, but it's way easier if the f
cs. Some of your talks involve the whiteboard. I mean, you go very slowly, and you really focus on the most simple principles, and that's a beautiful, that enforces a kind of a minimalism of ideas that I think is surprising at least for me is great for education. Like a great talk, I think, is not one that has a lot of content. A great talk is one that just clearly says a few simple ideas, and I think the whiteboard somehow enforces that. Peter Abbeel, who's now one of the top roboticists and reinforcement learning experts in the world, was your first PhD student. So I bring him up just because I kind of imagine this must have been an interesting time in your life, and do you have any favorite memories of working with Peter, since you were your first student in those uncertain times, especially before deep learning really sort of blew up? Any favorite memories from those times? Yeah, I was really fortunate to have had Peter Abbeel as my first PhD student, and I think even my long term professional success builds on early foundations
al things in Transcend, the nine steps to living well forever, your book. You describe just that. There's practical things like health, exercise, all those things. Yeah, I mean, we live in a body that doesn't last forever. There's no reason why it can't, though, and we're discovering things, I think, that will extend it. But you do have to deal with, I mean, I've got various issues. Went to Mexico 40 years ago, developed salmonella. I created pancreatitis, which gave me a strange form of diabetes. It's not type one diabetes, because it's an autoimmune disorder that destroys your pancreas. I don't have that. But it's also not type two diabetes, because type two diabetes is your pancreas works fine, but your cells don't absorb the insulin well. I don't have that either. The pancreatitis I had partially damaged my pancreas, but it was a one time thing. It didn't continue, and I've learned now how to control it. But so that's just something that I had to do in order to continue to exist. Since your particular biological system, you had to figure out a few hacks, an
 the athlete side of things has, if anything, just gotten substantially worse, I would say. And some of this is due to the nature of all games will be learned, will be gamed without even the rules being broken. And once that's figured out, you need to make an adjustment. No adjustments have been made. So the game just appears to be the same game over and over and over and over and over again on ESPN+, on whatever, on whatever, on whatever. It doesn't really matter which night you watch. It's the same game constantly. And that's not because the athletes are worse or better. It's because they have had that game structure long enough that they figured out what do you do to be the most successful at it? What is the highest percentage way of approaching it, essentially, even if you're not thinking of percentages? What were the... If we take a step back, it's really fascinating to think about the early UFCs. Did you fight Dan Severn in the UFC? I fought him in Super Brawl. Super Brawl, so that was in the early, early days, your undefeated... 2000. What were th
y allow you to now work at the sort of full level of understanding, not just in your brain, but across your body, not just in one gene, but across the set of pathways and so on and so forth for every one of these disorders. So I think that we're finally at the level of systems medicine of basically instead of sort of medicine being at the single gene level, medicine being at the systems level where it can be personalized based on the specific set of genetic markers and genetic perturbations that you are either born with or that you have developed during your lifetime. Your unique set of exposures, your unique set of biomarkers, and your unique set of current set of conditions through your EHR and other ways. And the precision component of intervening extremely precisely in the specific pathways and the specific combinations of genes that should be modulated to sort of bring you from the disease state to the physiologically normal state or even to physiologically improved state through this combination of interventions. S
e circles and the apple shape and then you have smaller Mandelbrot sets recursively in this set. And there's a way to mathematically by solving high order polynomials to figure out where these centers are and what size they are approximately. And by sort of mathematically approaching this problem, you slowly get a feeling of why things are like they are and that sort of isn't, you know, first step to understanding why this rich phenomena. Do you think it's possible, what's your intuition? Do you think it's possible to reverse engineer and find the short program that generated these fractals sort of by looking at the fractals? Well, in principle, yes, yeah. So, I mean, in principle, what you can do is you take, you know, any data set, you know, you take these fractals or you take whatever your data set, whatever you have, say a picture of Convey's Game of Life and you run through all programs. You take a program size one, two, three, four and all these programs around them all in parallel in so called dovetailing fashion, give them computatio
ual cortex, which is supposed to be very much just vision. Well, if you are thinking of semantic concepts, you're thinking of language, visual cortex lights up. It's still useful, even for language computations. So there are common structures underlying them. So utilize what you need. And when you are understanding a scene, you're understanding relationships. Well, that's not so far from understanding relationships between words and concepts. So I think that that's how they are integrated. Yeah, and there's dreams, and once we close our eyes, there's still a world in there somehow operating and somehow possibly the visual system somehow integrated into all of it. I tend to enjoy thinking about aliens and thinking about the sad thing to me about extraterrestrial intelligent life, that if it visited us here on Earth, or if we came on Mars or maybe another solar system, another galaxy one day, that us humans would not be able to detect it or communicate with it or appreciate, like it'd be right in front of our nose and we were too self obsesse
m. I love that. Is there something deeper to be said about our trust in institutions and governments and so on that has to do with UFOs? That there's a kind of suspicion that the US government and governments in general are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs. This is my view on that. If we declassified everything, I think we would find a lot more evidence all pointing toward the same puzzle. There aren't some alien men being held underground. There's not some secret file that lays out whatever is happening. I think the real lesson about government is government cannot bring itself to any new belief on this matter of any kind. And it's a kind of funny inertia. Like government is deeply puzzled. They're more puzzled than they want to admit to us, which I'm okay with that, actually. They shouldn't just be out panicking people in the streets. But at the end of the day, it's a bit like approving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which does work and they haven't approved it. When are they gonna do it? When is our government actually, if only 
economic decision making at the margin, it makes a lot more sense and you can understand why people decide and make the decisions that they do. Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis, things don't make sense. The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve is what is called the water diamond paradox. So you will die without water. We all need water and yet water is dirt cheap. Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous, nobody needs them. Nobody is gonna live or die because they have a diamond and yet they're extremely expensive. So why is it that as human beings, we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water, whereas we pay thousands of dollars for a few grams of diamonds. Why is this the case? Do we value water less than diamond? The answer is no, but at the margin where we are right now, you live in a place where water is very abundant because cities are only built in places where water is abundant. And you're only making a choice about the next unit of water. And so water is extremely abundant and you're choosing about w
hese at a time by sort of cutting them directly from the DNA. So instead of synthesizing, which basically has the limit of 450,000 that you can synthesize at a time, we basically said, Hey, if we want to test all accessible regions of the genome, let's just do an experiment that cuts accessible regions. Let's take those accessible regions, put them all with the same end joints of the puzzles, and then now use those to create a much, much larger array of things that you can test. And then tiling all of these regions, you can then pinpoint what are the driver nucleotides, what are the elements, how are they acting across 7 million experiments at a time. So basically this is all the same family of technology where you're basically using these parallel readouts of the barcodes. And then to do this, we used a technology called StarSeq for self transcribing reporter assays, a technology developed by Alex Stark, my former postdoc, who's now API over in Vienna. So we basically coupled the StarSeq, the self transcribing reporters where the enhancer ca
e need. Yet, right? Right, but I think, I mean, they're gonna get permission for this because there are a lot of people who absolutely need it because they can't communicate. I know a couple people like that who have ideas and they cannot, they cannot move their muscles and so on. They can't communicate. And so for them, this would be very valuable, but we could all use it. Basically, it'd be, turn us into something that would be like we have a phone, but it would be in our minds. It would be kind of instantaneous. And maybe communication between two people would not require this low bandwidth mechanism of language. Yes, exactly. We don't know what that would be, although we do know that computers can share information like language instantly. They can share many, many books in a second. So we could do that as well. If you look at what our brain does, it actually can manipulate different parameters. So we talk about these large language models. I mean, I had written that it requires a certain amount of information in order to be effective and 
 orally, like when you have speech, it might be some other kind of sounds, and decision making, but also vision. Eye has evolved many times. Various vision systems have evolved. So we would see those kinds of solutions, I believe, emerge over and over again. They may look a little different, but they get the job done. The really interesting question is, would we have primates? Would we have humans or something that resembles humans? And would that be an apex of evolution after a while? We don't know where we're going from here, but we certainly see a lot of tool use and building, constructing our environment. So I think that we will get that. We get some evolution producing, some agents that can do that, manipulate the environment and build. What do you think is special about humans? Like if you were running the simulation and you observe humans emerge, like these tool makers, they start a fire and all this stuff, start running around, building buildings, and then running for president and all those kinds of things. What would be, how would 
o an end. You know, it's a gift I didn't earn. Is there a good thing to say about why this gift that you've gotten and didn't deserve is so damn enjoyable? So like, what's the meaning of this thing, of life? To me, interacting with people I love, my family, and I have a very wide circle of friends now and I'm trying to produce some institutions that will survive me as well as my work and it's just, it's, how should I say? It's a positive feedback loop when you do something and people appreciate it and then you wanna do more and you get rewarded and it's just, how should I say? This is another gift that I didn't earn and don't understand, but I have a dopamine system and yeah, I'm happy to use it. It seems to get energized by the creative process, by the process of exploration. Very much so. And all of that started from the little fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang. Frank, well, whatever those initial conditions and fluctuations did that created you, I'm glad they did. This is, thank you for all the work you've done, for the many people you've insp
hed, but it seems a kind of generalization you get from that that you don't get in our current methods so far. So I just talked to Vladimir Vapnik, for example, who's a statistician of statistical learning, and he kind of dreams of creating the E equals MC squared for learning, right? The general theory of learning. Do you think that's a fruitless pursuit in the near term, within the next several decades? I think that's a really interesting pursuit in the following sense, in that there is a lot of evidence that the brain is pretty modular. And so I wouldn't maybe think of it as the theory, maybe the underlying theory, but more kind of the principle where there have been findings where people who are blind will use the part of the brain usually used for vision for other functions. And even after some kind of, if people get rewired in some way, they might be able to reuse parts of their brain for other functions. And so what that suggests is some kind of modularity. And I think it is a pretty natural thing to strive for to see, can we 
o a much greater degree inside of a virtual world. And then love means fulfillment, that means happiness, that's the thing you look forward to. And not some kind of dopamine rush type of love, but like long lasting like friendship. Yeah, yeah. The real deal. Yeah. The question is on what is there in the way of applications, the content, and can it feed you those things? Can it give you, like in my example of using the CAD program, it gives me the ability to do something I enjoy, which is imagining things and making things in a particular way. Can we psychoanalyze you for a second? Sure. What exactly do you enjoy? Is there some component of you building the thing where you get to at least a little bit share with others? Like is there a human in the loop outside of you in that picture? Will anyone ever see it? Right. There's a source of your enjoyment because I would argue that perhaps when like the turtles all the way down, when you get to the bottom turtle, it has to do with other sharing with other humans. Yeah. And if you can then put t
 a lot of momentum. And because of that, those same instruments can't also measure momentum because they're disturbing the momentum that, and then the momentum brings in energy and yeah. So that there's also the effect that asymptotic freedom comes from the possibility of spontaneously making quarks and gluons for short amounts of time that fluctuate into existence and out of existence. And the fact that that can be done with a very little amount of energy and uncertainty and energy translates into uncertainty and time. So if you do that for a short time, you can do that. Well, it's all comes in a package. So I told you it would take a while to really explain, but the results can be understood. I mean, we can state the results pretty simply, I think. So in everyday life, we do encounter some forces that increase with distance and kind of turn off at short distances. That's the way rubber bands work, if you think about it, or if you pull them hard, they resist, but they get flabby if the rubber band is not pulled. And so there are, that 
a, how do I form a memory really, really quickly? Like instantaneous. If it takes an hour to grow a synapse, like that's not instantaneous. So there are types of synapses called silent synapses. They look like a synapse, but they don't do anything. They're just sitting there. It's like if an action potential comes in, it doesn't release any neurotransmitter. Some parts of the brain have more of these than others. For example, the hippocampus has a lot of them, which is where we associate most short term memory with. So what we speculated, again, in that 2016 paper, we proposed that the way we form very quick memories, very short term memories, or quick memories, is that we convert silent synapses into active synapses. It's like saying a synapse has a zero weight and a one weight, but the longterm memory has to be formed by synaptogenesis. So you can remember something really quickly by just flipping a bunch of these guys from silent to active. It's not from 0.1 to 0.15. It's like, it doesn't do anything till it releases transmitter. And if I do that over a 
on just does good things in a crude fashion. So in your blog post, Zero Principle Thinking, good title, you ponder how do people come up with truly original ideas. What's your thoughts on this as a human and as a person who's measuring brain data? Zero principles are building blocks. First principles are understanding of system laws. So if you take, for example, like in Sherlock Holmes, he's a first principles thinker. So he says, once you've eliminated the impossible, anything that remains, however improbable, is true. Whereas Dirk Gently, the holistic detective by Douglas Adams says, I don't like eliminating the impossible. So when someone says, from a first principles perspective, and they're trying to assume the fewest number of things within a given timeframe. And so when I, after Braintree Venmo, I set my mind to the question of, what single thing can I do that would maximally increase the probability that the human race thrives beyond what we can even imagine? And I found that in my conversations with others in the books I read, in my 
e day that you earned it. So anybody could provide for their future and anybody could have very high degree of certainty that whatever they're saving is going to be there when they want it in the future. Because the money supply was only increasing at one and a half percent, whereas the production of goods and services was increasing for most cases, for most periods at a higher rate than that. So you could buy more apples and oranges and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years than you could at the beginning of the 10 years. So everybody had a way of providing for the future. And with that, people lower their time preference. And that is reflected across all aspects of life. I think it's not just the economic thing. You see it in the savings rate, the ability to deny yourself gratification today. I could take the money that I have and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht. And yet you decided, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to keep it so that tomorrow I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht or have a bett
eed has decreased. It's that your brain has hit the overdrive switch, the overboost switch to say, we need to keep you awake because food is in short supply. So you mentioned during sleep, there's a simulation, all those kinds of things for learning purposes, but there's also these, you mentioned the five ways in which we become psychotic in dreams. What do you think dreams are about? Why do you think we dream? What place do we go to when we dream? And why are they useful? Not just the assimilation aspect, but just like all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams. Is there something you can speak to that's actually useful? Like why we have such fun experiences in that dream world? So one of the camps in the sleep field is that dreams are meaningless, that they are an epiphenomenal byproduct of this thing called REM sleep from which dreams come from as a physiological state. So the analogy would be, let's think of a light bulb, that the reason that you create the apparatus of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light in the 
ashing machine and my Bitcoin, I'll choose Bitcoin. It's a technology that has been, that has already saved my life, and I think it's gonna save the lives of many, many, many, many more people. So, but of course, I don't have to choose between my Bitcoin and my washing machine because this is, you know, we're just constantly consuming more energy and we're gonna continue to consume more energy in this world, and that's just what progress is. And a small remark. So, in principle, I don't think this is a problem, but the other thing about Bitcoin, where it is different from washing machines, Bitcoin is truly unique in this. It's the only thing whose energy consumption can be produced absolutely anywhere. Your washing machine needs to be in your house where you live, and you live in a city surrounded by 10 million people, and they all have their washing machines, and they're all connected to the grid, and they generally tend to do their laundry around the same time. And so you have to put the load of the washing machine on the grid at the same time. T
. Federal reserve, or you could have a welfare check. You're going. I learned that in a cancer ward. I had people in my ward that died on me. I was going around as a little bit of an ambassador because I was trying to, I was putting on a fake, I was putting on a fake like I got this, I got this. I was so scared. But when I got past that seven days of torture was working underneath, under the wing of a senior man, as we say. A senior man is a guy with a lot of experience. And he'll watch over you, make sure you don't veer off, like I veer off a lot in talking. And you don't veer off, and you get yourself hurt. In the morning of 1993 bombing, Henry Miller was my senior man. And I was the young guy under his wing. And he protected me. And toward the end of the day, he looked around. He said, kid, it's a bad day. He said, they didn't do it right. They blew it up in the middle. If they did it in a corner, they would have dropped this building half a mile down at Canal Street. But don't kid yourself. They'll be back, and they'll do it. And they'll do it right next 
ickup and he couldn't go any further because the traffic was stopped up because they had a report of a bomb. So everything was held up and he grabbed his fire gear and he put it on, stuff weighs about 60 pounds. And he ran through the tunnel. Two and a half miles, got to the end of the tunnel, fire truck was coming in from the other way. He hopped on the back, got him up to West Street, jumped off, tried to look for his company, where they were and he was never seen again. He just ran through the tunnel. Ran through the tunnel and he got there to help his team, right? It's all about the team, it's all about the guy right next to you. And he's the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, Steven. His brother Frank decided in his name in perpetuity, he's got a fund that now builds a home for every Gold Star family, for every seriously battle wounded warrior, for every seriously wounded first responder or killed in a line of duty first responder. If they had a home, they'll pay the mortgage. If they didn't have a home, they give them a home. And especially if 
llars are digital. And, but I think the way that over the last couple of years I've changed my mind on this, I think there's some serious substance behind these ideas. And what they mean effectively is the disintermediation of the banking system and giving everybody an account at the Federal Reserve. This is kind of the really dangerous idea. And I think this is enormously significant. Effectively, as somebody who's lived in the Soviet Union, what this is, is the return of the Gosbank on a global scale with modern technology. So under the Soviet Union, there was something called the Gosbank or People's Bank. And that was the only bank in the country. And you had an account with the National Bank. And if you said something wrong, your money got terminated from the Gosbank. Now, imagine that combined with the power of digital technology. And you can see that this could be an enormously powerful technology really, because if banks are out of the picture, then we changed the fundamental reality of fiat as being the creation of money thro
 sequential decision theory. But the question is, on which probability distribution do you base that? If I have the true probability distribution, like say I play backgammon, right? There's dice, and there's certain randomness involved. Yeah, I can calculate probabilities and feed it in the expected max, or the sequential decision tree, come up with the optimal decision if I have enough compute. But for the real world, we don't know that, you know, what is the probability the driver in front of me breaks? I don't know. So depends on all kinds of things, and especially new situations, I don't know. So this is this unknown thing about prediction, and there's where Solomonov comes in. So what you do is in sequential decision tree, you just replace the true distribution, which we don't know, by this universal distribution. I didn't explicitly talk about it, but this is used for universal prediction and plug it into the sequential decision tree mechanism. And then you get the best of both worlds. You have a long term planning agent, but it doesn't need
e existential ideas that we have encountered today, but in the context of a story of someone who finds out that he is terminally ill, it's set in the South and the, um, heyday of like segregation. So there's a lot of social issues, a lot of existential issues, but it's basically a novel, a fictional account of someone who finds out that they're terminally ill and who reacts originally as, um, uh, you might expect anyone, uh, becomes more, um, hostile to people who are different, like petty and stupid denies that anything's happening. But, uh, as the book goes on and he comes more to terms, um, with his own mortality, um, it ends lovingly. And then, uh, back to your idea about, you know, love being incredibly potent. That's the, the nice thing, as you mentioned, uh, before with, with Heidegger, I really liked that idea. And I've seen that in people who are terminally ill is they bring, you know, the idea of death becomes, uh, current. It becomes like a thing, you know, I could die. I really liked that idea. I, I can die. Not just tomorrow, but like now, now, now. Yea
ore is less are you in this company versus that company or academia versus industry I think the thing that affects your experience most is who are the people you're interacting with in a daily basis so even if you look at some of the large companies the experience of individuals in different teams is very different and what matters most is not the logo above the door when you walk into the giant building every day what matters the most is who are the 10 people who are the 30 people you interact with every day so I actually tend to advise people if you get a job from a company ask who is your manager who are your peers who are you actually going to talk to we're all social creatures we tend to become more like the people around us and if you're working with great people you will learn faster or if you get admitted if you get a job at a great company or a great university maybe the logo you walk in is great but you're actually stuck on some team doing really work that doesn't excite you and then that's actually a really 
ma, it's tragedy. It's like money, who gives a shit about money? Education, all of that is like weird new inventions. You know, life is short. You suffer with the various diseases. And that is a reminder that life is short and a reminder of the basic human connection. And that's why you can bridge that gap. Oh yeah. All sparked by a handwritten letter, which just makes for a hell of a story. And you know what, Lex? This is the commonality between us. A guy with three jobs to a billionaire. We both had that sense of a sledgehammer to the chest. Boom, you have cancer and you can't breathe for like 30 seconds. And then when your heart's just about to kick off and you take a breath and you go, I'm sorry, what'd you say, doc? You have cancer. And it don't matter what kind. One of my best buddies, Bobby's going through right now, a prostate, and I got way too many of my buddies with cancer, right? My buddy, Hugh, who became a vet since his first cancer, he was a fireman, he's now a veterinarian, right? He diagnosed me actually over the phone, by the way. When they c
 then it's on the front page of newspapers around the world. So it's really good for science. It's not easy to get science on the front page of the New York Times. It's not there. Should be, but it's not. And so the Nobel prize is important in that way. Otherwise, I have a certain celebrity that I didn't have before. And now you get to be a celebrity that advertises science. It's a mechanism to remind us how incredible, how much credit science deserves and everything. Well, it has a little bit more. One thing I didn't expect, which is good, is that we have a government. I'm not picking on ours necessarily, but it's true of all governments are not run by scientists. In our case, it's run by lawyers and businessmen. Yep. Okay. And at best they may have an aide or something that knows a little science. So in all countries hardly take into account science in making decisions. Yes. Okay. And having a Nobel prize, the people in those positions actually listen. So you have more influence. I don't care whether it's about global warming or what the issue is. Th
nteraction. I create your consciousness, no, I create my consciousness by having interacted with you. And that's the display of consciousness. It's the same as like the display of emotion. Emotion is created through communication. Language is created through its use. And then we somehow humans kind of, especially philosophers, the hard problem of consciousness or the hard problem of consciousness, really wanna believe that we possess this thing. That's like there's an elf sitting there with a hat or like name tag says consciousness, and they're like feeding this subjective experience to us as opposed to like it actually being an illusion that we construct to make social communication more effective. And so I think if you focus on creating the illusion of consciousness, you can create some very fulfilling experiences in software. And so that to me is a compelling space of ideas to explore. I agree with you. And I think going back to our experience together with Brain Interfaces on, you could imagine if we get to a certain level of ma
fe and you would recommend. Spent four hours driving here, perseverating about that. I didn't, I, everything else you sent me as fine. And I actually, I skimmed it and I'm like, I don't want to look at it because I want, I want us to talk. The ones in blue. I'm like, all right. And you know, I've already said that I've found backers work and I put the denial of death out there. Um, is that his best, sorry, a small tangent. Is there other books that of his? Yes. If I could have this count as one that the, the birth and death of meaning, the denial of death and escape from evil are three books of Ernest Becker's that I believe to all be profound in a, in a little sort of brief dance around topics. Um, I've only read denial of death. Like, well, how do those books connect in here? Yeah. Nice. So the, the birth and death of meaning is where Becker situates his thinking in more of an evolutionary foundation. So I like that for that reason. Escape from evil is where he applies the ideas in the denial of death more directly, um, to economic matters and to ineq
o build something that's general, not only so that you can do better in one task or multiple tasks, but also future tasks and future challenges. So you learn the structure of the world and that helps you in all kinds of future challenges. And so you're trying to design a representation that will support an arbitrary set of tasks in a particular sort of class of problem. Yeah, and also it turns out, and that's again, a surprise that Elliot found was that those tasks don't have to be very related. You know, you can learn to do better vision by learning language or better language by learning about DNA structure. No, somehow the world. Yeah, it rhymes. The world rhymes, even if it's very disparate fields. I mean, on that small topic, let me ask you, because you've also on the competition neuroscience side, you worked on both language and vision. What's the connection between the two? What's more, maybe there's a bunch of ways to ask this, but what's more difficult to build from an engineering perspective and evolutionary perspective, the human lan
 it doesn't matter, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what anybody else does if your response in violence, even to their violence, if you're the winner, is often going to be penalized severely. Society, state apparatus, they don't want any of that. They wanna be the only arbiter of violence in the world, always. But I learned a very difficult lesson with that, and it was really impactful in a negative way on me, but also I had to learn, on an individual sense, to, you need to manage violence, too, because, hey, if someone attacks you or starts a fight with you and you go at it, okay, beating them up is one thing, trying to grab a handful of broken glass from the street and throw it in their face, maybe that's a bit much at seven. So you need to learn what level is necessary, and you need to learn what comes with all, what's the responsibility of, when you enact violence, I mean, you take on something when you have a responsibility for that. This is the extension of your actions. But as I got older, and especially as I found sports, an
pen, but not within their lifetimes. There's been so many advances in AI that the poll of AI experts has come down over the years. So a year ago, something called Meticulous, which you may be aware of, assesses different types of experts on the future. They again assessed what AI experts then felt. And they were saying 2042. For the Turing test. For the Turing test. So it's coming down. And I was still saying 2029. A few weeks ago, they again did another poll, and it was 2030. So AI experts now basically agree with me. I haven't changed at all, I've stayed with 2029. And AI experts now agree with me, but they didn't agree at first. So Alan Turing formulated the Turing test, and... Right, now, what he said was very little about it. I mean, the 1950 paper where he had articulated the Turing test, there's like a few lines that talk about the Turing test. And it really wasn't very clear how to administer it. And he said if they did it in like 15 minutes, that would be sufficient, which I don't really think is the case. These large language models now, some people are convinced 
t if it's something I already know or if it's a new thing. And I have to, I'm doing both at the same time. I don't say, oh, let's see if it's a new thing. Oh, let's see if it's an old thing. I don't do that. As I go, my brain says, oh, it's new or it's not new. And if it's new, I start learning what it is. And by the way, it starts learning from the get go, even if it's gonna recognize it. So they're not separate problems. And so that's the thing there. The other thing you mentioned was the fast learning. So I was just talking about continuous learning, but there's also fast learning. Literally, I can show you this coffee cup and I say, here's a new coffee cup. It's got the logo on it. Take a look at it, done, you're done. You can predict what it's gonna look like, you know, in different positions. So I can talk about that too. In the brain, the way learning occurs, I mentioned this earlier, but I'll mention it again. The way learning occurs, imagine I am a section of a dendrite of a neuron, and I'm gonna learn something new. Doesn't matter what it is. I'm just gonna learn 
scheme, right? They're trying to sell you math tutoring or they're working some kind of marketing plan on you. So the traditional engines become actually less useful over time for their original educational purpose. That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be replaced by newer and better ones. First of all, to defend the people with the angle, right? They're trying to find business models to fund, oftentimes, which is funny you went with Pythagorean, like you went at math, those greedy bastards, but it's great. How can we monetize the Pythagorean theorem? Yeah. Well, I mean, education, right, is just to figure out like people who love math education, for example, love it purely, not purely, but very often love it for itself, for just teaching math. Yeah. Because, you know, when coming face to face with, for example, like the YouTube algorithm, they start to try to figure out, okay, how can I make money off of this? The primary goal is still that love of education, but they also want to make that love of education their full time job. But I see that sort 
on. It's what you and I have chosen to think about. It's what we've chosen to work on. And this is why I'm saying that no generation of humans have ever been afforded the opportunity to look at their lifespan and contemplate that they will have the possibility of experiencing an evolved form of consciousness that is undeniable. They would fall in a zero category of potential. That to me is the most exciting thing in existence. And I would not trade any momentary neurochemical state right now in exchange for that. I would, I'd be willing to deprive myself of all momentary joy in pursuit of that goal because that's what makes me happy. That's brilliant. But I'm a bit, I just looked it up. I'm with, I just looked up Braveheart's speech and William Wallace, but I don't know if you've seen it. Fight and you may die, run and you'll live at least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance, picture Mel Gibson saying this, to come back here and t
etter or worse. Some might have been good and bad in either one. And so that's why it needs so many experiences. But once you have enough experiences, effectively RL is teasing that apart. It's trying to say okay, what is consistently there when you get a higher reward and what's consistently there when you get a lower reward? And then kind of the magic of sometimes the policy gradient update is to say now let's update the neural network to make the actions that were kind of present when things are good more likely and make the actions that are present when things are not as good less likely. So that is the counterpoint, but it seems like you would need to run it a lot more than you do. Even though right now people could say that RL is very inefficient, but it seems to be way more efficient than one would imagine on paper. That the simple updates to the policy, the policy gradient, that somehow you can learn, exactly you just said, what are the common actions that seem to produce some good results? That that somehow can learn any
ersity. Some other solutions become better. Doesn't mean that that was an attempt. It didn't quite work out or last, but there are still dinosaurs among us, at least their relatives. And they may one day again be useful, who knows? So from an individual's perspective, you got to think of a bigger picture that it is a huge engine that is innovative. And these elements are all part of it, potential innovations on their own. And also as raw material perhaps, or stepping stones for other things that could come after. But it still feels from an individual perspective that I matter a lot. But even if I'm just a little cog in a giant machine, is that just a silly human notion in an individualistic society, no, she'll let go of that? Do you find beauty in being part of the giant machine? Yeah, I think it's meaningful. I think it adds purpose to your life that you are part of something bigger. That said, do you ponder your individual agent's mortality? Do you think about death? Do you fear death? Well, certainly more now than when I was a youngster and
And is that a good goal to strive for? I don't think the term pure free market's well defined because you need a legal order. Legal order has to make decisions on like what is intellectual property more important than ever. There's no benchmark that like represents the pure free market way of doing things. What will penalties be? How much do we put into law enforcement? No simple answers, but just saying free market doesn't pin down what you're gonna do on those all important questions. So free market is an economics, I guess, idea. So it's not possible for free market to generate the rules that are like emergent, like self governing? It generates a lot of them, right? Through private norms, through trade associations. International trade is mostly done privately and by norms. So it's certainly possible, but at the end of the day, I think you need governments to draw very clear lines to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems. You know, I've been hanging out with other group of weirdos, lately Michael Malice, who espouses to be an an
o, not just survive each other, but they're a part of being able to hunt and other things. So violence is a part of human nature. Violence is, it's an absolute. It is in every person, it is a part of every interaction, it is a part of every law, everything. And I'm not, by the way, I'm not an ANCAP. So don't even, don't hit your wagon to me on that one. ANCAP is anarchic capitalist. Anarchic capitalist, yes. Not an ANCAP. They have nice book shops. Yeah, they do. I mean, I'm not gonna sit here and shit talk ANCAPs. Although I also used to get into the conversations with an ANCOM, anarcho communist, a good friend of mine. And he would bring up this stuff and I'm like, yeah, cool, man, I'm down with anarchy. You ain't gonna like it. What do you mean? I go, cause I'm gonna take all, I'm gonna gather all kinds of people together. I'm gonna make this, I'm gonna get the strongest together and I'm going to take your shit. Okay, can I ask you on that topic, I have a friend of mine now, a fellow Russian, Ukrainian, Michael Malice. Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with Michael Malice. I watc
, um, with a standoff or like boxing or some kinds of sword fighting, you're, you're not touching the other person. Most of the time, your, your, your visual system is doing something way more, it's doing slam and trying to figure out what the other person is up to. And so, um, that always felt more my speed. So in an Olympic style fencing, you're, it doesn't start really until you're crossing blades with the other person and now you're back to wrestling, you're feeling what they're doing and it's all about that. But some of the older sword arts, um, don't engage the blade that way. You stand off at range and then you make cutting attacks and, um, and, uh, and so, so those are all processed visually and I think I'm more of a slow thinker, so it works for me better. I mean, the same, it has the same, the artistry and the beauty of boxing, I suppose, just like you said, is like, there's no, there's no contact and it's all processed visually and I'm sure there's a dance of its own that, that depends on the characteristic of a sword involved. Yeah. There is a set of, 
t I'm gonna do next. And I see at the same time you have a kind of, you have a sense that there's a Bruce Springsteen single line of albums. So like, it's already known somewhere in the universe what you're going to do next, is the sense you have. In a sense, yes. I don't know if it's predetermined, you know? But there's something like that. Yeah, I'd like to believe that there's, well, it's kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess. Once you observe it, maybe once you talk to the muse, it's one thing for sure. It was always going to be that one thing. But really, in reality, it's a distribution. It could be any number of things. Yeah, I think so. There's alternate realities. Alternate realities, yeah. But they're not that far apart. I mean, Bruce Springsteen is not gonna write a Joni Mitchell song, you know? No matter how hard he tries. But he still went on Broadway. I mean, he still did that, which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do. So I think you're being, in retrospect, it all makes sense. I think it is a Bruce Springsteen thing to do. It's a next sort of evo
nk that very strongly humans are social and that gives us ability to structure the world. But also as a society, we can do so much more because one person does not have to do everything. You can have different roles and together achieve a lot more. And that's also something we see in computational simulations today. I mean, we have multi agent systems that can perform tasks. This fascinating demonstration, Marco Dorego, I think it was, these little robots that had to navigate through an environment and there were things that are dangerous, like maybe a big chasm or some kind of groove, a hole, and they could not get across it. But if they grab each other with their gripper, they formed a robot that was much longer under the team and this way they could get across that. So this is a great example of how together we can achieve things we couldn't otherwise. Like the hyenas, you know, alone they couldn't, but as a team they could. And I think humans do that all the time. We're really good at that. Yeah, and the way you described the system
ia? Is it gonna be Iran? Is it gonna be India? None of these countries wants to be, you know, they don't wanna jump out of the US based system to get into somebody else's based system. So China doesn't wanna use a Russian system. Russia doesn't wanna use a Chinese system. And so therefore you can't use their own central bank's currencies. Don't you think they have enough leverage, India, China, Russia combined with several other nations have enough leverage and incentive to create their own system? So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate. Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you based on? Like who's going to be the boss? Who's going to be the one who can? In this case, China, right? Because China's becoming increasingly an economic power in the world. Yeah. That's hard to deny. Yes, it's true. And it's the most likely scenario perhaps if we were to witness something like this is going to be a Chinese based system. So is it possible to have like a split in what is the driving currency of the world? It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable. Again
 it immediate? What are possible trajectories that take us? Well, basically where the final sort of empirical observation is that you overtake, Bitcoin overtakes first gold and then bonds in terms of its monetary power in the world. But like just specifically from a government perspective, how do we move the United States, China, Russia, India, European Union to a Bitcoin standard? I'm not entirely concerned about whether governments move or not. In fact, I'd be very happy for them not to move as long as possible so that individuals can accumulate more and more Bitcoin while it's still cheap. So the people will move and the governments will catch up. Yeah, and I think this is kind of what I allude to. I mean, the point of the fiat standard, the fiat standard is really a Bitcoin book and it talks about fiat most of the time, but it does so to analyze Bitcoin and the rise of Bitcoin. In the final chapter, I discuss how I think this relationship plays out. The way that I tend to think of it is that most likely what's going to happen is we
fordable. So in which other ways, as you outline your book, is life getting better? Because I think... Well, I mean, I have 50 charts in there where everything is getting better. I think there's a kind of cynicism about, like even if you look at extreme poverty, for example. For example, this is actually a poll taken on extreme poverty, and people were asked, has poverty gotten better or worse? And the options are increased by 50%, increased by 25%, remain the same, decreased by 25%, decreased by 50%. If you're watching this or listening to this, try to vote for yourself. 70% thought it had gotten worse, and that's the general impression. 88% thought it had gotten worse or remained the same. Only 1% thought it decreased by 50%, and that is the answer. It actually decreased by 50%. So only 1% of people got the right optimistic estimate of how poverty is. Right, and this is the reality, and it's true of almost everything you look at. You don't wanna go back 100 years or 50 years. Things were quite miserable then, but we tend not to remember that. So literacy rate increasing over the pas
r martial arts as a business. Give you a belt, put a stripe on your belt. Each of these iterations cost 20 bucks. So, you know. But there's a benefit to that too. I really enjoyed the progression of belts. Sure. You know, a bit of it is OCD or whatever, but you're enjoying the recognition, your growth when you feel, when you're made to feel, when I think genuinely you do earn it. Yeah. I agree. I agree. It makes complete sense to me. It just, it's anything that is, has a goodness in its purity can also have a detriment in its perversion. So. And there's a value to competition. I've gotten some shit in the past for saying this. I've gotten the most value in giving everything I have to try to win and lose. So like, I've gotten, I remember most of the matches I've lost and I think that's what I've gotten the most from the sport is losing. Think about it. I mean, if you really think about it, what makes you wanna actually, in detail, go over what happened? Oh, it's the time when you didn't get what you wanted. Yeah. It's a time when you gave it everything you had an
 can say the election was stolen, or whatever controversial position they're taking, and they'll keep saying it until you wager real money on it. So maybe there's something there, if you could kind of turn that into a, put a user interface on that. Yeah, have a stake in your divisiveness, in your arguments. Will Dogecoin take over the world? Twitter question. You know, I don't follow the different coins that much, so I don't, I mean I hear about Dogecoin and I've kind of followed the story of it. So the interesting aspect of Dogecoin is it, so in contrast to like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are these serious implementations of cryptocurrency that seek to solve some of the problems that we're talking about with smart contracts and resist the banks and all those kinds of things, Dogecoin operates more in the space of memes and humor, while still doing some of the similar things. And it presents to the world sort of a question of whether memes, whether humor, whether narrative will go a long way in the future. Like much farther than some kin
t ultimately, like you said, it's love. It is, it's the common, love is the most important ingredient on this earth and that's the problem what's going on right now, like take politics out of it, right? Take polarizing each other against each other, take all that crap out of it and just airdrop a bunch of love, right? Like when I worked on Rescuing Me, right? I love those people so much, they were such great, we had such a great crew and they worked so hard. You're a celebrity. No, no, no, not at all. If I was, it didn't really work out so good. I went on to be in the stagehand, no, I'm not pretty, but they don't want old guys waving bye bye hairdos, but it was funny, the crew, we became really tight, we had like, shoot, like 80, 90 people on a set, right? And you know, the first few episodes, everybody's trying to feel each other out because you know, you work with different crews, different people and this is going back, starting in 2004, so it was a different time and I love to hug people because to me, a hug is a true expression of love and caring. You may not kno
h, so let's go to the actions now. But actually, good that you asked. Usually I skip this part, although there is also a minor contribution which I did, so the action part, but I usually sort of just jump to the decision part. So let me explain the action part now. Thanks for asking. So you have to modify it a little bit by now not just predicting a sequence which just comes to you, but you have an observation, then you act somehow, and then you want to predict the next observation based on the past observation and your action. Then you take the next action. You don't care about predicting it because you're doing it. Then you get the next observation, and you want, well, before you get it, you want to predict it, again, based on your past action and observation sequence. You just condition extra on your actions. There's an interesting alternative that you also try to predict your own actions. If you want. In the past or the future? In your future actions. That's interesting. Yeah. Wait, let me wrap. I think my brain just broke. We should maybe di
e's some practical experience that we're not yet that good as teaching in a course and I think after exhausting the efficient coursework then most people need to go on to either ideally work on projects and then maybe also continue their learning by reading blog posts and research papers and things like that doing projects is really important and again I think it's important to start small and just do something today you read about deep learning feels like oh all these people doing such exciting things what if I'm not building a neural network that changes the world then what's the point? Well the point is sometimes building that tiny neural network you know be it MNIST or upgrade to a fashion MNIST to whatever so doing your own fun hobby project that's how you gain the skills to let you do bigger and bigger projects I find this to be true at the individual level and also at the organizational level for a company to become good at machine learning sometimes the right thing to do is not to tackle the giant project is
. So this library which has all books has zero information content. we know already now they are limiting. So, for instance, usually you need a goddessity assumption in the MDP frameworks in order to learn. A goddessity essentially means that you can recover from your mistakes and that there are no traps in the environment. And if you make this assumption, then essentially you can go back to a previous state, go there a couple of times and then learn what statistics and what the state is like, and then in the long run perform well in this state. But there are no fundamental problems. But in real life, we know there can be one single action. One second of being inattentive while driving a car fast can ruin the rest of my life. I can become quadriplegic or whatever. So, and there's no recovery anymore. So, the real world is not ergodic, I always say. There are traps and there are situations where you are not recover from. And very little theory has been developed for this case. What about, what do you see in the context of IECSIA as th
en done for centuries? I think there is. I think there's just the simplicity of it and not having any intermediary technology beyond the pen and the paper is just very simple and clean and so I've got a bunch of fountain pens. I started buying fancy paper from Italy a few years ago because I thought I would be more conservative with it, but it's still a trivial expenditure, so it doesn't really alter my habits very much. So all that said, once you do type stuff up, you use Emacs. I use Emacs, obviously the superior editor. Of course. Let me just ask the ridiculous futuristic question because Emacs has been around forever. Do you think in 100 years we will still have Emacs and Vim, or like pick a let's say 50, 100 years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I mean whenever you're doing anything in Linux, you're spending a lot of time editing little config files and scripts and stuff and you need to be able to pop in and out of editing those things and it needs to work. Like even if the windowing GUI is dead and all you've got is like a command line, to get out of
 turn something into self play, you're in a beautiful situation where you can naturally learn much more quickly than in most other reinforcement learning environments. So I think if somehow we can turn more reinforcement learning problems into self play formulations, that would go really, really far. So far, self play has been largely around games where there is natural opponents. But if we could do self play for other things, and let's say, I don't know, a robot learns to build a house. I mean, that's a pretty advanced thing to try to do for a robot, but maybe it tries to build a hut or something. If that can be done through self play, it would learn a lot more quickly if somebody can figure that out. And I think that would be something where it goes closer to kind of the mathematical leapfrogging where somebody figures out a formalism to say, okay, any RL problem by playing this and this idea, you can turn it into a self play problem where you get signal a lot more easily. Reality is, many problems we don't know how to turn into sel
asingly, I think with the modern technology, this is increasingly becoming online. And I think you should consider how you can create value online, because that scales beyond anything that you can do in the physical world in a very, very, well, maybe not beyond, obviously, there are profitable businesses in the physical world. But I think online is enormous potential, and coding, I think, is enormously powerful. I'm not a coder myself, but I strongly recommend people get into learning how to code. And I think it's probably the thing that carries the most power. So initially, we were working with our hands, we started working with machines, machines are much more productive. Well, code is an even higher level of productivity where you basically program the machines to produce things. So, you know, few clicks of a keyboard, and you can move millions of machines around the world in certain ways. So it carries an enormous amount of value. I think I always tell all young people to learn to code, it's the best thing. I used to tell it to my studen
 principles. There are distributed processing systems and distributed memory systems, and that's how the brain works. They use things that we might call them neurons, but they're really not neurons at all. So we can just, they're not really neurons. So they're distributed processing systems. And that nature of hierarchy, that came also from neuroscience. And so there's a lot of things, the learning rules, basically, not back prop, but other, you know, sort of heavy on top of that. I'd be curious to say they're not neurons at all. Can you describe in which way? I mean, some of it is obvious, but I'd be curious if you have specific ways in which you think are the biggest differences. Yeah, we had a paper in 2016 called Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses. And if you read that paper, you'll know what I'm talking about here. A real neuron in the brain is a complex thing. And let's just start with the synapses on it, which is a connection between neurons. Real neurons can have everywhere from five to 30,000 synapses on them. The ones near the cell body, the ones
t? Yes, he does because he introduced some important liberalizing measures. He lowered taxes. He allowed land to be bought and sold. He deregulated many areas of the economy. And so there was a kind of entrepreneurial burst that was partly attributable, partly attributable to government policy during his first term. But also he was consolidating political power. And as I said, the methods he used overall for the long term were not able to continue sustain that success. In addition, we have to remember that China played a really big role in the success of Russia in the first two terms of Putin's presidency because China's phenomenal growth created insatiable demand for just about everything that the Soviet Union used to produce. So fertilizers, cement, fill in the blank, chemicals, metals, China had insatiable demand for everything the Soviet Union once produced. And so China's raising of global demand overall brought Soviet era industry back from the dead. And so there was something that happened. Soviet era industry fell off a clif
 get. Cause I mean, that's where, I mean, some of the human players can hit it on the lines, which is very high precision. With spin, the spin is an interesting, whether RL can learn to put a spin on the ball. Well, you got me interested. Maybe someday we'll set this up. Sure, you got me intrigued. Your answer is basically, okay, for this problem, it sounds fascinating, but for the general problem of a tennis player, we might be a little bit farther away. What's the most impressive thing you've seen a robot do in the physical world? So physically for me, it's the Boston Dynamics videos. Always just bring home and just super impressed. Recently, the robot running up the stairs, doing the parkour type thing. I mean, yes, we don't know what's underneath. They don't really write a lot of detail, but even if it's hard coded underneath, which it might or might not be just the physical abilities of doing that parkour, that's a very impressive. So have you met Spot Mini or any of those robots in person? Met Spot Mini last year in April at the Mars event that Je
omic principles and practice, but and also assumes that everybody who makes any profit from anything is somehow stealing it and really assigns a negative moral aspect to them. And then it's like, oh yeah, but then eventually communism will happen. No one will act that way anymore. And you're like, whoa, hold on. You just said that people are all, are you saying it's all due to capitalism or is it innate? It's just, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of, and it's like, hey, look at you. You're like a notorious, like antisemitic, angry, like just absolute curmudgeon of a human being who seems to be really not all that fun to be around. Marx? Yeah, and then it's just like. So you have to think like, if there was 1 billion Marx's in the world, how would they behave? It would be absolute. They would hate each other so bad. And this isn't, for me to even poison them well on Marx is like, oh, his personality sucks. Like there's lots of people whose personality sucks. That doesn't mean they can't make, I don't know that it's never, what? You know what, somebody argues
ean, conspiracy theories take hold for a reason. Cause some of them are true. No, yeah. The hard thing is just to know which ones is the problem. When you don't have facts, right? Or you don't know who to trust. Sometimes when you don't have facts, when you don't have figures and you don't have science, it's hard to take someone's word on it. You know, I had a conversation with someone a while back, right? And the guy's like, just, just dedicated atheist. And he thinks I'm an idiot for believing in God. And he's like, yo, you're one of those jerks who believes in creation. And I said, well, I do. Well, what about the big bang theory? He's going on his diatribe about the science and the gases and the chemistry. And I'm going, dude, I barely got through high school chemistry, slow down. And he went on a tangent and all of a sudden I stopped. I went, who, who created the gas and the molecules and the stuff you're talking about and the collisions? And he was furious and stoned off. And I got him. And again, I had no facts. I had no figure. He didn't either, but I stump
e role of exploration? Sort of, you mentioned in the real world you can get into trouble when we make the wrong decisions and really pay for it. But exploration seems to be fundamentally important for learning about this world, for gaining new knowledge. So, is exploration baked in? Another way to ask it, what are the potential to ask it, what are the parameters of IECSIA that can be controlled? Yeah, I say the good thing is that there are no parameters to control. Some other people track knobs to control. And you can do that. I mean, you can modify IECSIA so that you have some knobs to play with if you want to. But the exploration is directly baked in. And that comes from the Bayesian learning and the longterm planning. So these together already imply exploration. You can nicely and explicitly prove that for simple problems like so called bandit problems, where you say, to give a real world example, say you have two medical treatments, A and B, you don't know the effectiveness, you try A a little bit, B a little bit, but you don't want 
ed him. But sometimes when you can't show something, people need to see something tangible. They need to see it in their hand to believe it. And that's the real hard thing about faith. I see it in action. People restore my faith. And then I say to myself, well, there can't be that many dummies in this world if there's so many billions of us believing in this higher power, this higher, right? I mean, and you said, you said earlier, like you believe most people are good and I do too. The bad outshine the good because the bad get the press. Right? If it bleeds, it leads. That's just, you know, like, think about it. How many more damn zombie apocalypse movies can we make? Right? I didn't even know there was that many zombies. Yeah. And it just seems like every other show is just guys like, you know, bashing each other's heads in with bats with nails in it. And it's like, after a while, it's like, all right, gosh, you gotta get a new boogeyman here. You know, right? Like, but seriously, like. But meanwhile, human civilization is getting better and better. We're just 
u know, Mother Nature's program, I suspect it usually comes at the cost of something else. So maybe he is able to direct and focus his sleeping cognition on those particular topics that will gain him better problematic resolution the next day when he wakes up. The question is though, at what cost of the other things that didn't make it onto the menu of the finger buffet of sleep that night? And is it that you don't process the emotional difficulties or events, and therefore you are less emotionally resolved the next day, but you are more problem resolved the following day. And so I always try to think, and I truly don't want to sound puritanical either about sleep, and I think I've come off that way many a times, especially when I started out in the public. The tone of the book, in some ways, I look back and think, could I have been a little softer? And the reason was I was that way back in when I started writing the book, which was probably something like 2014 or 15, sleep was the neglected stepsister in the health conversation of the da
 great, right? They're still human, still got to deal with the same. Yeah, exactly, because they want love, right? They want love and they can't really find it. Well, first of all, that's true for all of us. I think we're deeply lonely and looking for love and when we find it, that's what friendship is. Absolutely. And then that's true for whether you're super rich or super poor, it's all the same journey. My dad said all the time, kid, you're gonna end up working with hundreds of guys and you'll love a lot of them but he says when it's all said and done and you're all like me and if you've still got two or three of them that you talk to and you'll love. And I tell you what, I mean, I have thanked the Lord more than two or three of them and I have my six, I call it my six, it's the six guys that are gonna carry my coffin when I'm gone, right? Because I know this cancer's gonna come back, I know it. Like we get multiples, right? My friend Yvette just got his second. My friend Mike's had five of them. My other Mike has two of them, yeah. But I wasn't ready to acc
o something with it. And it could work, it could not work. If it works, you get a positive return. You get more gold back. If it fails, you might not get any of your gold back. So taking on risk is something very different from saving. Saving is just a way of buying the future. Investing is taking on a risk and you could lose everything with it. So what ends up happening, and this is the Keynesian objection I think is very wrong and bad because investment is a job in itself. To figure out what to do with your money in order to beat inflation is something that there are professionals out there on Wall Street that have PhDs in finance, that have enormous computers, and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master's degrees and math nerds that are crunching numbers and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio so that you can beat inflation. And guess what? The majority of them don't beat inflation. The majority of them can't beat inflation. Not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent, but if you remember. 14%. Yeah, that 14% or ev
d to heal my fractured soul. And I'm in the middle of a beautiful farming rural area in middle Tennessee. And so they probably called me a sellout back in New York for leaving, but it's not the same city and it's sad. I'll refrain from the politics and the finger pointing, but it's a mess compared to what it was. And I did Broadway theater security for many years, and I started to see it slide like with stuff that was happening, like public urination and defecation and just like tourists don't wanna see that, right? And I had an unfortunate incident two years ago. I was jumped by four teenagers coming off the subway and they were pissed off because I was wearing an American flag hat. And I don't know, I'm not really sure why, but it left me, I got out of it, okay. But I was taken back. They were literally videoing it and the kid was just throwing shadow punches at my face wanting to beat me up. And I finally looked him in the eyes and I was like, oh boy, I'm a little too old for this. Body's a little broken down for chemo. And I finally just
e that are going to be drawn in more, uh, because they're going to, uh, to, to find that, um, oh, I didn't see that coming, you know, you know, it's got some of the complexity and surprise value of the real world. Yeah. It does something, um, uh, Alex Garland, director who did, uh, who wrote, uh, directed Ex Machina. I think about AI movies and the more care you take in making it accurate, the more compelling the story becomes somehow. I'm not, I'm not sure what that is. Um, maybe because it becomes more real to the people writing the story, maybe it just makes you a better writer. The key to any storytelling is getting the, the readers to suspend their, their disbelief. And there's all kinds of triggers and little tells that can break that. Right. Um, and once it's broken, it's really hard to get it back. Uh, you know, a lot of times that's the end. Everybody will just close the book and not pick it up. Um, I gotta ask you, you've answered this question, but I gotta ask you the most impossible question for an author to answer, but which Neal Stephenson book shou
at's a medal, not $50 billion of Bitcoin. Well, that's, I. No, I know, I know, I'm joking. Well, that's actually an interesting, just a brief comment. You know, when people talk about Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency space, that it's often mixed up financial interest and ideas. And I think those are often correlated, but that good feeling you get when you win or number go up or you just, just somebody, you know, I found 20 bucks on the street the other day. And just that feeling of just like, ooh, like more money, that positive feeling, that's correlated, but it is distinct from the power of the idea to change a world, to change the world for the better. For the, to alleviate, it's like Alex Gladstein, in the case of Bitcoin, that decreased the amount of suffering in the world because of the authoritarian regimes. And just because your number goes up like that gambling feeling of like, yes, yes, this is good. And I mean, short term number go up. There's a long term number go up that's more like investment and so on. And there's a short term number go up that's just 
ou not because what you're doing is good but because you play on their sense of tribalism. In your book, you do cost benefit analysis. So you do acknowledge or think about the pros of fiat currency. Can you do just that, look at the benefit and look at the cost just broadly at the highest level? So the way that I write the fiat standard is that I try and analyze it as an engineering system in the same way that I wrote the Bitcoin standard. So with the Bitcoin standard, I looked at Bitcoin from first principles and tried to explain how it works for a reader that doesn't really have much of a background in computer science, networks or economics. And I thought I'll do the same with the fiat. Let's just ignore the official stories and look at how this thing actually works. And I think it does have value in the fact that the reason that they were able to pull it off is because it was not possible for people who don't want to be part of it to use gold independently of governments. This is really the key thing. Gold is just very expe
 first capital good probably. So we're constantly accumulating capital. We're constantly trading with one another. We find an opportunity. You've got a lot of oranges. I've got a lot of apples. Then I'll take some of yours. You'll take some of mine. We're both better off. This is just a naturally emergent thing. And money is what makes it enormously powerful. Money is what allows it to scale really. Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies into just something that is global. Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier, all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing, the thing that you do best, and then you exchange that for money. And you don't have to worry about whether the other people involved in this want what you have and have what you want. You just sell it for money to whoever wants it. And you buy whatever you want from whoever has it. And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden of how a market economy functions. So the first thing that I would say about money is that it allows for the division of 
penditure that to match the supply. To match the level of output. Sounds pretty good to me, I'm sold. All right. Even though you're saying huckster, so. Yes. I just, you know, the way, I love you very much, but like just for people who are listening, I think it's, I love the way you talk and it's great and keep doing it, but just for context, like I don't know anything that involves human nature deserves this level of certainty. I, at least my position is that we don't know what the hell we're doing on basically anything. Perhaps, but I mean. Like there's a lot, like certainty can get us in trouble is my worry. I don't know much about economics. I don't even know, you know, financial systems, monetary systems, but I just seen us get in trouble with human psychology, certainty, certainty of ideologies in general. You mentioned Marxism and so on. I came from the Soviet Union. There's a lot of people that are very certain throughout the history of the 20th century that communism is the utopia that humanity should strive for. So I'm nervous around certainty. I 
tuff goes away after a couple of years. So it gradually washes out. And so it's not a permanent thing. The good news, bad news is it's not permanent. So if you don't like what's happening, you can just stop and wait a couple of years and you'll get back to where you started. The bad news if you're in favor of this kind of thing is that you have to keep doing it forever. So this guy is one of those, he's read these papers, the TR, the character in the book. He knows all this and all people who are familiar with climate science kind of know this. It's a pretty well established fact. And so he just decides he's going to take action unilaterally and do this. And so there's different ways to get the sulfur up there, but because it's Texas, he builds the biggest gun in the world. It's just six barrels pointed straight up and he begins firing shells loaded with sulfur into the stratosphere. And so the book is about not so much that as how people react to his doing that, what the political ramifications are around the world because this is an extre
 said, all right, all right. I just had enough, I wanted to go home. Just worked a 17 hour shift as a stage hand. And I was so taken back, I was so insulted. I'm saying, I spent my life protecting this city and now I'm getting attacked like for nothing. And I just, I gave up and maybe I should have given it a little more time, but it's, I don't know, it's turned into an angry place. It's turned into, I think there's a lot of people that aren't getting the resources they need in a sense. There's a lot of mental illness. There's a lot of homelessness. There's a lot of violent people just roaming around the streets and it's not good. It's not safe. And tourists are not gonna come back. Even just leading up to the COVID, I had some tourists saying to me, I won't be back. And now I can only imagine that it's just gotten exponentially worse, but I hope there's a chance it'll swing back. Cause it is, it's the gateway to the world. I mean, my grandfather came from Denmark. He landed in Ellis Island in the twenties. American success story, 25 bucks in his pocket, didn't spe
tiful. Yeah. So again, from an evolutionary computation perspective, we'll look at all the agents that had to die in order to come up with different solutions in simulation. What do you think from that individual agent's perspective is the meaning of it all? So far as humans, you're just one agent who's going to be dead, unfortunately, one day too soon. What do you think is the why of why that agent came to be and eventually will be no more? Is there a meaning to it all? Yeah. In evolution, there is meaning. Everything is a potential direction. Everything is a potential stepping stone. Not all of them are going to work out. Some of them are foundations for further improvement. And even those that are perhaps going to die out were potential energies, potential solutions. In biology, we see a lot of species die off naturally. And you know, like the dinosaurs, I mean, they were really good solution for a while, but then it didn't turned out to be not such a good solution in the long term. When there's an environmental change, you have to have div
at no one's done before. So it's technically not just gravitational waves. And so it's built on failures. But anyway, we did before me, even there, the people did R&D on the concepts. But starting in 1994, we got money from the National Science Foundation to build this thing. It took about five years to build it. So by 1999, we had built the basic unit. It did not have active seismic isolation at that stage, didn't have some other things that we have now. What we did at the beginning was stick to technologies that we had at least enough knowledge that we could make work or had tested in our own laboratories. And so then we put together the instrument. We made it work. It didn't work very well, but it worked. And we didn't see any gravitational waves. Then we figured out what limited us. And we went through this every year for almost 10 years, never seeing gravitational waves. We would run it, looking for gravitational waves for months, learn what limited us, fix it for months, and then run it again. Eventually, we knew we had to take another big step. And
n genetics has been so transformed in the last decade or two that human genetics is now actually driving the basic biology. There is more genetic mutation information in the human genome than there will ever be in any other species. What do you mean by mutation information? So perturbations is how you understand systems. So an engineer builds systems and then they know how they work from the inside out. A scientist studies systems through perturbations. You basically say, if I poke that balloon, what's going to happen? And I'm going to film it in super high resolution, understand, I don't know, aerodynamics or fluid dynamics if it's filled with water, et cetera. So you can then make experimentation by perturbation and then the scientific process is sort of building models that best fit the data, designing new experiments that best test your models and challenge your models and so on and so forth. This is the same thing with science. Basically if you're trying to understand biological science, you basically want to do perturbations 
e perhaps a great person to ask about the basics. What is Austrian economics? What is Keynesian economics? How do you compare the two? What should people know? What are the interesting defining characteristics to you about these schools of thought? So Austrian economics, the way that I say it, Austrian economics is economics. It's, we call it Austrian economics because economics has been hijacked by a bunch of frauds, really. Or people who are wrong, okay. Well, it's much worse than wrong, by people who are just essentially propagandists for inflation. Right. So. It's like your opinion, man. Right. Yeah, well, that's also like your opinion, man. Yeah. But you asked. That's true. Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast. So he's, the O speaks enough, but he's one of the people that is perhaps most harshly criticized by folks in Austrian economics perspective and vice versa, which is a fascinating tension. Yeah, he's done a great job as an actor who plays an economist on TV and the internet. So anyway, now tell me what you really think. No, but, so
y what we call research. But it's driven by, hopefully, you ask good questions. If you ask good questions and you have the mechanism to solve them, then you do what I do in life, basically, not necessarily physics. And it's a great quality in humans, and we should nurture it. Do you remember any other kind of in high school, maybe early college, more basic physics ideas that sparked your curiosity or mathematics or science in general? I wasn't really into science until I got to college, to be honest with you. But just staying with water for a minute, I remember that I was curious what happens to water. It rains and there's water in a wet pavement, and then the pavement dries out. What happened to this water that came down? And I didn't know that much. And then eventually, I learned in chemistry or something, water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. Those are both gases. So how the heck does it make this substance? It's liquid. Yeah, so that has to do with states of matter. I know perhaps LIGO and the thing for which you've gotten the Nobel Pri
t it also got a lot of people to dismiss the idea with mockery, of course. But I really think Bitcoin is the only technology that's going to end World War I. Once World War I started, we got into this endless conflict that's been ongoing since then. If you look at all the world's conflicts today, pretty much they all trace back to World War I. And it's because when that Pandora's box of government control of money was opened, there was no longer a real restraint on war except complete defeat and complete destruction and complete death. The war had to be total. Before that, under the gold standard, kings would send professional armies to fight each other in battlefields. And as soon as it became clear that one side was establishing an advantage, the fighting would stop and the kings would settle, would agree to new terms. Because it was extremely expensive to build a professional army and you ran out of money. So it was always the smartest thing to do is to just stop fighting whenever you could. And wars would take place. Countries w
back in Russia compared to here? Would you, you might because of family ties, but I mean, if you had no ties to Russia or would you want to go to China right now and possibly end up in a labor camp or, right? There's people busting down the doors to get to this place. It's not perfect. It's got its flaws, it's got its blemishes, you know, but it's a damn great place. It's the best country in the world. Yeah, and some of it, so first of all, I have hope for New York. I think that culture is very difficult to kill. I think it will persevere. And I think ultimately the same story with New York as with the rest of the United States, it has to do with leaders. And I'm always hopeful that great leaders will emerge. I agree. And the kind of leadership we see now and the kind of conversations we have now, I think it has to do with the prosperity and comfort. And in the face of hardship, I think great leaders will emerge. And yeah, I just think ultimately in the long arc of history. Well, leaders shouldn't become rich. They shouldn't become rich in the proc
ve Google page 20 is the REM sleep. Both I think are critical, both are necessary. That's fascinating. And again, fascinating to see how that could be integrated in the machines to help them learn better and to reason better. And in some ways we also know it from a chemical perspective too. When you go into dream sleep, it is a neurochemical cocktail like no other that we see at the rest of the 24 hour state. There is a chemical called noradrenaline or norepinephrine in the brain. And you know of its sister chemical in the body called adrenaline. But upstairs in the brain, noradrenaline is very good at creating a very hyper focused, attentive, narrow, it's sort of very convergent way of thinking to a point, sharp focus, that's the only thing. The spotlight of consciousness is very narrow. That's noradrenaline. When you remove noradrenaline, then you go from a high SNR, a high signal to noise ratio where it's just you and I in this moment, I don't even know what's going on elsewhere. I am with you, noradrenaline is present. But when you go into R
ces. And that was our search base. See if you can do better. And we indeed could, 15% better performance by just searching around the network design that humans had come up with, Oreo vinyls and others. So, but that's starting from a point that humans have produced, but we could do something more general. It doesn't have to be that kind of network. The hard part is, there are a couple of challenges. One of them is to define the search base. What are your elements and how you put them together. And the space is just really, really big. So you have to somehow constrain it and have some hunch what will work because otherwise everything is possible. And another challenge is that in order to evaluate how good your design is, you have to train it. I mean, you have to actually try it out. And that's currently very expensive, right? I mean, deep learning networks may take days to train while imagine you having a population of a hundred and have to run it for a hundred generations. It's not yet quite feasible computationally. It will be, but also ther
put much value in sleep. Whether or not that's true, we don't know, but he was a habitual napper. You're right, during the day, I've got some great pictures of him on his inventor's bench taking a nap. And in fact, I believe he set up nap carts around his house so he could nap. But what we also know, a study, again, coming out of Harvard just a couple of months ago, demonstrated very clearly that polyphasic sleep is associated with worse physical outcomes, worse cognitive outcomes, and especially worse mood outcomes. So from that sense, sleeping like a baby is not perfect for adults. So there's a fascinating dance here of the mean and the extreme, like the average and the high performers. So I, this gets to like the meaning of life kind of discussion, but let's go that way. And also happiness. So when studying sleep and when studying anything like diet and exercise, I think you have to really get a lot more data about individuals to make conclusive statement. That's when people talk about like, is meat, red meat good for you or bad for you, righ
happens is that evolution discovered, it took a mechanism, and this is in our recent theories, but it took a mechanism evolved a long time ago for navigating in the world, for knowing where you are. These are the so called grid cells and place cells of an old part of the brain. And it took that mechanism for building maps of the world, and knowing where you are on those maps, and how to navigate those maps, and turns it into a sort of a slimmed down, idealized version of it. And that idealized version could now apply to building maps of other things. Maps of coffee cups, and maps of phones, maps of mathematics. Concepts almost. Concepts, yes, and not just almost, exactly. And so, and it just started replicating this stuff, right? You just think more, and more, and more. So we went from being sort of dedicated purpose neural hardware to solve certain problems that are important to survival, to a general purpose neural hardware that could be applied to all problems. And now it's escaped the orbit of survival. We are now able to apply it to 
particles to sit in the lab so that we can study them. In economics, you're forcing people to do things. Let's stop these people from doing this job because it's bad for the economy and let's get them to do that job. Let's force them to pay this price. Let's tax them this much. Let's prevent them from using gold as money and force them to use our credit as money. So it has to rely on coercion. There's no central planning without coercion. And coercion is a crime, in my opinion. There's no way that it is justifiable morally or ethically. So from a politics, from an ethical perspective, your view is the, I mean, perhaps the, broadly speaking, the libertarian view is coercion is unethical, freedom is essential. What is, what are the pros and cons of government intervention in the economy? So can you steal, can you provide pros? You just kind of provided arguments against. Is there any arguments to be made for government intervention, for the role of government in society? Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective, what is the posit
he family. Take care of that. I'm more superficial. You mentioned Keats and that higher version, that non Darwinian love. What's that about? That it's the highest form of human connection and it's intoxicating and it's part of building a life. And most of us are very, very strongly drawn to it. And it's part of the highest realization of you being what you can be. Yeah. He mentioned you lost. But ask a Russian. I mean, this is a superficial New Jersey boy who grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen and that was his romanticism. What's your favorite Bruce Springsteen song? I think the album Born to Run has actually held up the best. Though it's very fashionable to think the earlier or later works are actually better. And that's the overproduced super pop album. But the quality of the songs, to me Born to Run is just far and away the best. Then Darkness on the Edge of Town. And those are still my favorites. Born to Run is an incredible song. And perfectly produced in a Phil Spector kind of way. Every detail is right. Every lyric. What else is on t
re, they're trying to take each other down and they score points along the way. You can end matches by pinning them, for example, on their back. I think one way to describe wrestling is it's very much about figuring out ways to establish control and leverage in these kind of tie ups, or there's different styles where you can do more from a distance to where it's more about the timing and all that kind of stuff. Ultimately, it's an art of like both upper body and lower body and you could choose the different puzzles that you solve there. You could be attacking the head, the arms, you could be attacking the legs. There's also part of collegiate wrestling that's on the ground that has more, what's called like a referee's position or whatever. The referee's position where you're on your hands and knees basically. And so. Do you understand what that's supposed to simulate? Why is that one of the standard positions? It's one of the standard positions because one, it's one of the easiest ways to actually get up, but two, it's because you cannot be on 
itler started using rockets, that's an accident of, okay, that's fascinating. That's a fascinating set of coincidences. Yeah, which is true of a lot of technologies, by the way. By the time these rockets are kind of working, we've got hydrogen bombs that are so big and so devastating that nobody really wants to use them. But it turns out you can fit a capsule with a couple of people in it into the socket on the end of a missile that was made to hold a hydrogen bomb. So we start doing that instead as a proxy for having a war. I'd love to be in the meeting where the first guy brought that up as an idea. It's probably a Russian. Why don't we strap a person to the rocket? Yeah, yeah. Well, it probably was because they did it first, right? The Russians did it first. And they had perhaps less respect for sort of safety protocols. Could be. They were a little bit more willing to sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to risk the life of an astronaut. Could be. Yeah, yeah. This is basically the story of how through all of this competition and because 
on to be able to do. You gave a lot of credit to, I think, Caltech and MIT for some of the technical developments within this project. Is there some interesting things you can speak to at the low level of some cool stuff that had to be solved? I'm a software engineer, so I have so much more respect for everything done here than anything I've ever done. So I'll give you an example of doing mechanical engineering at a better, basically mechanical engineering and geology and maybe at a level. So what's the problem? The problem is the following, that I've given you this picture of an instrument that by some magic, I can make good enough to measure this very short distance. But then I put it down here, it won't work. And the reason it doesn't work is that the Earth itself is moving all over the place all the time. You don't realize it, it seems pretty good to you, but it's moving all the time. So somehow it's moving so much that we can't deal with it. We happen to be trying to do the experiment here on Earth, but we can't deal with it. So we have 
r descriptions of the Soviet system. Think of it as weird mixes of barter and malfunctioning incentives and being very good at a whole bunch of things, but in terms of progress, innovation, and consumer goods, it really being quite a failure. And now I wouldn't call that communism, but that's what I think of the system the Soviets had. And it required an ever increasing pile of lies that both alienated people, but created an elite that by the end of the thing no longer believed in the system itself, or even thought they were doing better by being crooks than by just say moving to Switzerland and being an upper middle class individual, like you would have a higher standard of living by Gorbachev's time, not Gorbachev, but if you're a number 30 in the hierarchy, you're better off as a middle class person in Switzerland. And that, of course, did not prove sustainable. And so it's, what is it, a momentum of bureaucracy or something like that, it just builds up where you lose control of the original vision, and that naturally happens, it's just 
anarchy into the corners where you want it. It doesn't bother me, but I think people are seeing it as more fun than it is. It's a new eSport, more fun for many, but more expensive than the old eSports. Like chess is a new eSport, super cheap, not as fun as like sending hedge funds to their doom, but like, what would you expect? The poetry, I love it, okay. But macroeconomically, it's not fundamental. Okay, I was going to say, I hope you're right, because I'm uncomfortable with the chaos of the masses that's creates. But I also think that chaos is somewhat real to be clear, but it will matter through other channels, not through manipulating GameStop or AMC. So you're seeing the real macro phenomenon. When people see a real macro phenomenon, they tend to make every micro story fit the narrative. And this micro story, like it fits the narrative, but it doesn't mean its importance fits the narrative. That's how I would kind of dissect the mistake I think people are making. The macro phenomenon that are there, do you mean? Everyone's weird now, the interne
at with big bottles? So here's the idea. You dissociate all of your cells or all of your nuclei from complex cells like brain cells that are very long and sticky so you can't do that. If you have blood cells or if you have neuronal nuclei or brain nuclei, you can basically dissociate let's say a million cells. You now want to add a unique barcode, a unique barcode in each one of a million cells using only big bottles. How can you possibly do that? Sounds crazy, but here's the idea. You use a hundred of these bottles, you randomly shuffle all your million cells and you throw them into those hundred bottles randomly, completely randomly. You add one barcode out of a hundred to every one of the cells. You then you now take them all out. You shuffle them again and you throw them again into the same hundred bottles. But now in a different randomization and you add a second barcode. So every cell now has two barcodes. You take them out again, you shuffle them and you throw them back in. Another third barcode is adding randomly from the sa
you detect that? Cause you're like really busy as the creator of this evolutionary system. So you don't have much time to observe, like detect if any cool stuff came up, right? How would you detect humans? Well, you are running the simulation. So you also put in visualization and measurement techniques there. So if you are looking for certain things like communication, you'll have detectors to find out whether that's happening, even if it's a large simulation. And I think that that's what we would do. We know roughly what we want, intelligent agents that communicate, cooperate, manipulate, and we would build detections and visualizations of those processes. Yeah, and there's a lot of, we'd have to run it many times and we have plenty of time to figure out how we detect the interesting things. But also, I think we do have to run it many times because we don't quite know what shape those will take and our detectors may not be perfect for them at the beginning. Well, that seems really difficult to build a detector of intelligent or intelligent 
ike I've gotten a lot of flack, like this conversation where in person now, and I've even with Edward Snowden who done all interviews remote, I'm a stickler to in person. It has to be in person like, and a lot of people just don't get it. They're like, well, why can't, this is so much easier. Like why go through the pain? Like I've traveled, I'm traveling in the next month to Paris for a single stupid conversation. Nobody cares about just to be in person. Well, it's important to me. I honestly, I was like this, and thank you for coming down to it. It's my pleasure, but again, it's very self serving. I've enjoyed this. I knew I was going to, but it's not about our enjoyment per se. Again, at the risk of sounding cavalier, there are a host of factors beyond verbal that I don't believe can be adequately captured. I don't care how much the acuity is decent on a zoom conversation. I feel again, I felt within five minutes that this was going to be for me easy in the sense that I could speak freely. I just don't see that happening so easily from a distance. Yeah, 
The following is a conversation with William McCaskill. He's a philosopher, ethicist, and one of the originators of the effective altruism movement. His research focuses on the fundamentals of effective altruism, or the use of evidence and reason to help others by as much as possible with our time and money, with a particular concentration on how to act given moral uncertainty. He's the author of Doing Good, Better, Effective Altruism, and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference. He is a cofounder and the president of the Center of Effective Altruism, CEA, that encourages people to commit to donate at least 10% of their income to the most effective charities. He cofounded 80,000 Hours, which is a nonprofit that provides research and advice on how you can best make a difference through your career. This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis, I'm sending love your way. Stay strong. We're in this together. We'll beat this thing. T
to make the instrument isolated from the Earth at the frequencies we're at. We've got to float it. That's an engineering problem, not a physics problem. So we're having a conversation on a podcast right now, and people who record music work with this, how to create an isolated room. And they usually build a room within a room, but that's still not isolated. In fact, they say it's impossible to truly isolate from sound, from noise and stuff like that. But that's like one step of millions that you took is building a room inside a room, because you basically have to isolate all. No, this is actually an easier problem. You just have to do it really well. So making a clean room is really a tough problem because you have to put a room inside a room. This is really simple engineering or physics. Okay, so what do you have to do? How do you isolate yourself from the Earth? First, we work at, we're not looking at all frequencies for gravitational waves. We're looking at particular frequencies that you can deal with here on Earth. So what are frequencies
ay, and I would do my, you know, exercise, whatever it was. But although I was still doing like 18 hours a day, but I'm definitely, I kind of think of it sort of like an athlete does. I'm sure that like Steph Curry is totally committed to winning championships and stuff like that. But he has his family, he sees his family, you know, the family is always there. He, I'm sure he eats, you know, perfect, great stuff, gets his sleep, you know, gets the training, you know, the whatever a trainer does to him for his knees and his ankles and whatever. So I, or Kobe Bryant or anybody that's operating at a high level. So I do think I'm from that kind of the health school. The good thing about being a writer is you can't work very many hours a day. You know, four hours is like the maximum I can work. I've never been able to work more than that. I don't know how people do it. I've heard of people do 10, 12, I don't know how they do it. So that gives you a lot of other time to do it. Optimize your health. Yeah, to optimize your health. Because you need to, you're in training, y
s parliaments as they were called. So you got socialism in Marx's schema by transcending, by eliminating capitalism. Now Marx also called for freedom. He said that this elimination of markets and private property and bourgeois parliaments would produce greater freedom in addition to greater abundance. However, everywhere this was tried, it produced tyranny and mass violence, death and shortages. Everywhere it was tried. There's no exception in historical terms. And so it's very interesting. Marx insisted that capitalism had to be eliminated. You couldn't have markets. Markets were chaos. You needed planning. You couldn't have hiring of wage labor. That was wage slavery. You couldn't have private property because that was a form of theft. So in the Marxist scheme, somehow you were going to eliminate capitalism and get to freedom. It turned out you didn't get to freedom. So then people said, well, you can't blame Marx because he said we needed freedom. He was pro freedom. So it's kind of like dropping a nuclear bomb. You say you're going to drop a
 educator. Yeah, I felt, you know, teaching at Stanford, teaching machine learning to about 400 students a year at the time. And I found myself filming the exact same video every year, telling the same jokes in the same room. And I thought, why am I doing this? Why don't we just take last year's video? And then I can spend my time building a deeper relationship with students. So that process of thinking through how to do that, that led to the first MOOCs that we launched. And then you have more time to write new jokes. Are there favorite memories from your early days at Stanford, teaching thousands of people in person and then millions of people online? You know, teaching online, what not many people know was that a lot of those videos were shot between the hours of 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. A lot of times, we were launching the first MOOCs at Stanford. We had already announced the course, about 100,000 people signed up. We just started to write the code and we had not yet actually filmed the videos. So a lot of pressure, 100,000 people waiting for us to produce the
know? And when do you know that you don't know it? Or when do you, what do you think you know that you don't really know? And these, I think clarifying those issues, when we clarify those issues and get a rich theory around self awareness, I think that will illuminate the questions about consciousness in a way that, you know, scratching your chin and talking about qualia and blah, blah, blah, blah is never gonna do. Well, I also have a different approach to the whole thing. So there's, from a robotics perspective, you can engineer things that exhibit qualities of consciousness without understanding how things work. And from that perspective, you, it's like a back door, like enter through the psychology door. Precisely, I think we're on the same wavelength here. I think that, and let me just add one comment, which is I think we should try to understand consciousness as we experience it as, in evolutionary terms, and ask ourselves, why, why does it happen? This thing seems useful. Why is it useful? Why is it useful? Interesting question. I think we've
any models of the coffee cup. So the coffee, there is no one model of a coffee cup. There are many models of a coffee cup. And you could say, well, how many different things can my finger learn? Is this the question you want to ask? Imagine I say every concept, every idea, everything you've ever know about that you can say, I know that thing has a reference frame associated with it. And what we do when we build composite objects, we assign reference frames to point another reference frame. So my coffee cup has multiple components to it. It's got a limb, it's got a cylinder, it's got a handle. And those things have their own reference frames and they're assigned to a master reference frame, which is called this cup. And now I have this Numenta logo on it. Well, that's something that exists elsewhere in the world. It's its own thing. So it has its own reference frame. So we now have to say, how can I assign the Numenta logo reference frame onto the cylinder or onto the coffee cup? So it's all, we talked about this in the paper that came out in De
ics in the positive meaning of the word manipulating, or is there downsides, drawbacks in this whole context of therapeutics that we're talking about or understanding and so on? So when I teach my students about CRISPR, I show them articles with the headline, genome editing tool revolutionizes biology. And then I show them the date of these articles and they're 2004, like five years before CRISPR was invented. And the reason is that they're not talking about CRISPR. They're talking about zinc finger enzymes that are another way to bring these cutters to the genome. It's a very difficult way of sort of designing the right set of zinc finger proteins, the right set of amino acids that will now target a particular long stretch of DNA because for every location that you want to target, you need to design a particular regulator, a particular protein that will match that region well. There's another technology called talons, which are basically just a different way of using proteins to sort of guide these cutters to a particular location o
le to reconstruct the 3D structure of it so you can put stuff on top of it. And doing that in real time, presumably not just real time, but in a way that creates a pleasant experience for the human perception system is, yeah, that's an engineering project. Right. Yeah, well said, and it's just one of the things that the system has to do. It's also tracking your eyes so it knows what you're looking at, how far away what you're looking at is. It's performing all those functions, and it's got to keep doing that without burning up the CPU or depleting the battery unreasonably fast, and that's just table stakes. It's just the basic functions of the operating system, and then any content that you want to add has to sit on top of that. It's got to be rendered by the optics at a sufficiently low latency that it looks real and you don't get sick. So it's an amazing thing, and a magically shipped device that can do that in 2019. And they're about to ship the ML2, but I don't know any more about that than anyone else because I don't work there anymore. Does it s
same way that we've evolved to this thing called REM sleep to serve whatever functions REM sleep serves. But it turns out that when you create light in that way, you also produce something called heat. It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb, it's just what happens when you create light in that way. And the belief so too was that dreaming was essentially the heat of the light bulb. That REM sleep is critical, but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours, you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon called dreaming. I don't believe that for a second. And from a simple perspective is that I suspect that dreaming is more metabolically costly as a conscious experience than not dreaming. So you could still have REM sleep, but absent the conscious experience of dreaming was probably less metabolically costly. And whenever mother nature burns the energy unit called ATP, which is the most valuable thing, there's usually a reason for it. So if it's more energetically demanding, then I suspect that there is a
o going on a gold standard. And since then, silver has been collapsing in value next to gold. So back then the price of an ounce of gold was around 15 ounces of silver. Today it's closer to 100. It's just been declining for the last 150 years. And so because of that, because of the fact that it's lost its monetary role as people shifted toward gold, the value of silver went down and so it became economical to use it in more and more industrial applications. So the stockpile declines and then as a result that weakens its monetary properties more and more and more. So that's why by the end of the 19th century, I mean at the beginning of the 19th century, gold and silver were money. By the end, it was basically only gold. And the countries that were still on a silver standard, China and India in particular suffered enormously from it because their money was devaluing very quickly next to gold and so Europeans who would come to China or India were able to buy things at practically a big discount. So I hope it's okay if I ask very simple, very basi
ce you know that causal variant, try to figure out what is the motif that is disrupted by that causal variant. Basically how does it act? Variants don't just disrupt elements, they disrupt the binding of specific regulators. So basically the third step there was how do you find the motif that is responsible like the gene regulatory word, the building block of gene regulation that is responsible for that dysregulatory event. And the fourth step is finding out what regulator normally binds that motif and is now no longer able to bind. And then once you have the regulator, can you then try to figure out how to, what after it developed, how to fix it? That's exactly right. You now know how to intervene. You have basically a regulator, you have a gene that you can then perturb and you say, well, maybe that regulator has a global role in obesity. I can perturb the regulator. Just to clarify, when we say perturb, like on the scale of a human life, can a human being be helped? Of course. Yeah. I guess understanding is the first step. No, no, but 
try to push aside an aging leader. There are many scenarios in which Putin could not last that long, but unfortunately, right now, you could also imagine potentially him lasting that long, which as I said, is not an outcome if you're patriotic about Russia, it's not an outcome you would wish out to the country. It's, I guess, a very difficult question, but what practically do you feel is a way out of the Putin regime, is a way out of the corruption that's deeply underlies the state? Is a, if you look from a history perspective, is a revolution required? Is violence required? Is from violence within or external to the country? Do you see, or is a powerful, is a inspiring leader enough to step in and bring democracy and kind of the free world to Russia? So Russia is not a failed country. It's a middle income country with tremendous potential and has proven many times in the past that when it gets in a bad way, it can reverse its trajectory. Moreover, violence is rarely ever a solution. Violence rarely, it may break an existing trend, but it's r
 spatial in some sense, or is there something that's more? No, it's definitely spatial. It's spatial in a mathematical sense. How many dimensions? Can it be a crazy number of dimensions? Well, that's an interesting question. In the old part of the brain, the entorhinal cortex, they studied rats, and initially it looks like, oh, this is just two dimensional. It's like the rat is in some box in the maze or whatever, and they know where the rat is using these two dimensional reference frames to know where it is in the maze. We said, well, okay, but what about bats? That's a mammal, and they fly in three dimensional space. How do they do that? They seem to know where they are, right? So this is a current area of active research, and it seems like somehow the neurons in the entorhinal cortex can learn three dimensional space. We just, two members of our team, along with Elif Fett from MIT, just released a paper this literally last week. It's on bioRxiv, where they show that you can, if you, the way these things work, and I won't get, unless you want to, I won
hat could be used in reinforcement learning? You've worked a little bit in this direction, but do you think that psychology can be somehow pulled in? Yes, that's a question I would say a lot of people ask, and I think part of why they ask it is they're thinking about how unique are we really still as people? Like after they see some results, they see a computer play Go, they see a computer do this, that, they're like, okay, but can it really have emotion? Can it really interact with us in that way? And then once you're around robots, you already start feeling it, and I think that kind of maybe mythologically, the way that I think of it is if you run something like reinforcement learning, it's about optimizing some objective, and there's no reason that the objective couldn't be tied into how much does a person like interacting with this system, and why could not the reinforcement learning system optimize for the robot being fun to be around? And why wouldn't it then naturally become more and more interactive and more and more maybe like a 
ight. So if I eat one meal a day, why not eat that one meal a day in the morning? Like I'm not, it never occurred to me, this revolutionary act, until you've outlined that. So maybe, can you give some details, and this is just you, this is one person, Brian, arrives at a particular thing that they do, but it's fascinating to kind of look at this one particular case study, so what works for you, diet wise? What's your actual diet, what do you eat, how often do you eat? My current protocol is basically the result of thousands of experiments and decision making. So I do this every 90 days, I do the tests, I do the cycle throughs, then I measure again, and then I'm measuring all the time. And so what I, of course I'm optimizing for my biomarkers, I want perfect cholesterol and I want perfect blood glucose levels and perfect DNA methylation processes. I also want perfect sleep. And so for example, recently, the past two weeks, my resting heart rate has been at 42 when I sleep. And when my resting heart rate's at 42, my HRV is at its highest. And I wake up in th
ere were particles and there was a huge amount of gravity and mass being made. So I'll say two things. One is, how did it all start? How did it happen? I'll give you at least one example that we don't understand what we should understand. We don't know why we're here. Yes. No, we do not. I don't mean it philosophically. I mean it in terms of physics. Now, what do I mean by that? If I go into my laboratory at CERN or somewhere and I collide particles together or put energy together, I make as much anti matter as matter. Anti matter then annihilates matter and makes energy. So in the early universe, you made somehow a lot of matter and anti matter, but there was an asymmetry. Somehow there was more matter and anti matter. The matter and anti matter annihilated each other. At least that's what we think. And there was only matter leftover. And we live in a universe that we see this all matter. We don't have any idea. We have ideas, but we don't have any way to understand that at the present time with the physics that we know. Can I ask a dumb questi
ren't even born. And there's people in the 20s that were too young to remember or to understand the events of that day. But I think what that day, as you're describing, means, it's not about a terrorist attack. It's about the unity that followed. It was tremendous, Lex. I never felt so proud. I was always proud of this country. You know, I remember my grandpa Nels used to walk by, I'd see a flag, I'd hear the Star Spangled Banner and he'd tear up and I'd say, Grant, why are you crying? He said, I'm not crying, it's the tears of joy. I love this country so much. And I just remember like feeling that way. I felt that way 910. I felt that way on 911, but then on 912, I was just so proud of just the people, the way they stepped up. And I just want to try to see if that can happen again. And I hope it's not necessary for us to have another tragedy to bring that about. Let's do that without the tragedy. Let's just stop and say, hey, you know what? Let me listen to what this guy has to say. And maybe he's, he probably won't convince me, but maybe I'll go, well, you know, I never th
 to help them adopt AI and I think this is one thing so make you know help drive global economic growth and make humanity more powerful and like you said the impact is there so what are the best industries the biggest industries where AI can help perhaps outside the software tech sector frankly I think it's all of them some of the ones I'm spending a lot of time on are manufacturing agriculture look into healthcare for example in manufacturing we do a lot of work in visual inspection where today there are people standing around using the eye human eye to check if you know this plastic part or the smartphone or this thing has a scratch or a dent or something in it we can use a camera to take a picture use a algorithm deep learning and other things to check if it's defective or not and thus help factories improve yield and improve quality and improve throughput it turns out the practical problems we run into are very different than the ones you might read about in in most research papers the data sets are really s
ta, to share a lot of deep personal data. And if you look at brain data, that feels a whole lot like it's richly, deeply personal data. So how do you think about privacy with this kind of ocean of data? I think we got off to a wrong start with the internet where the basic rules of play for the company that be was, if you're a company, you can go out and get as much information on a person as you can find without their approval. And you can also do things to induce them to give you as much information. And you don't need to tell them what you're doing with it. You can do anything on the backside, you can make money on it, but the game is who can acquire the most information and devise the most clever schemes to do it. That was a bad starting place. And so we are in this period where we need to correct for that. And we need to say, first of all, the individual always has control over their data. It's not a free for all. It's not like a game of hungry hippo, but they can just go out and grab as much as they want. So for example, when your b
ecause humans choose to make the valuation. However, the economic reality of the way that money works means that it's just a technology like all others, and so for me, when people say, well, if we hallucinate that this thing can be money, then it'll be money. If we can hallucinate bananas to be money, then it'll be money. For me, it's like saying, well, if we hallucinate that bananas can be spaceships, they'll be spaceships. I mean, you can call them spaceships if you want, but a banana's not gonna get you to the moon. Well, then nevertheless, that's true. So you're drawing a big distinction between physical reality and the space of belief, but it seems like so much power of human civilization, so much destruction, so much creativity, creation, happens in our minds. Absolutely, everything does happen in the mind. You're not gonna get to the moon, but you might still have a significant impact on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing. True, but economic reality exists in a way in which your beliefs are rewarded when they match up with 
ually, because I was waiting for him to say something and then I can be like, okay, well, it's one thing to want to get into a fight with someone. It's another thing to go pick on a little tiny, you know, guy like Ben, who's much smaller than you and doesn't train or whatever, but you know, if it's not me, I can find someone your size and you can go fight him. You know, don't be a, basically, don't be a bully piece of shit. Yeah. You know, which by the way, Tom Arnold, you are a mental midget. You are never going to be able to compete even with Ben Shapiro in an argument on any level about anything. Oh, intellectual argument. Yeah, intellectual argument. Maybe you can scream louder than him, but whatever. But nevertheless, in the discussion of greatness in fighting. I think you need to look at some of the numbers. You need to look at some of the numbers. And there's the magic. There is some context also in that, where did Alistair Overeem fight? Oh, he fought in Pride, where you could soccer kick people and stomp their head and this and that. And so the 
 a block away down at Engine 201's quarters and one of the older firemen as we're walking up the block, we're all struggling, we're all having a hard time breathing and just, I mean, I felt like I was dying, literally, it was pretty bad. And I just remember the one guy going out, we're all dead. And I said, no, no, we made it, we made it. He goes, no, you don't get it, kid. He said, we just breathed in poison after poison for hours and then that went into days and then went into months. He says, we're all dead, man, this is gonna take us all. And I thought he was crazy and then now years later, like starting in 03 or 04, guys just started coming down with these really rare and advanced cancers and then it just stopped being a coincidence with the number of guys and they were young, one of the first guys, John McNamara, he was 33 or 34 and he came down colon cancer and it took him quickly in 2000, he was in 2005. And I kind of said to friends and family, I said, I feel like I'm running through a minefield and I wonder when I'm gonna step on my mind because everybody's go
you, and nothing else really matters. When that guy right next to you goes down, it stops. You get that guy to safety, or if he's dead, you get him out. So in that time frame, that saved his life. But that's a heavy burden to carry now for the rest of your life, because you say, if I wasn't helping my dead friend, I'm dead. Yeah. What did it look like at Ground Zero? What did it feel like? What did it smell like? What, you said there was a sense that it was almost like a war zone, but can you paint a picture of how much dust is in the air? How hot is it? How many people are there? And again, how did it feel like? It was just, it was a scene of controlled chaos, controlled because there was a semblance of command, and we were just trying to do our jobs. But it was such a frantic pace because we're now digging frantically, knowing that there's life underneath this pile. And this is throughout the afternoon of that day, the evening. Yeah, I mean, this was nonstop, just nonstop, really, for days. But for my particular crew, we literally kept going. We initia
ize because somebody with 300 followers I've never met in my life who calls themselves a Bitcoiner said a mean word, and then I need to apologize, and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric about other digital currencies, and I need to do that. So I'm only responsible for my own actions, and I don't recall regretting anything. Okay, but let me push back or push further into that direction. Fine, let's leave community aside. Labels suck, for sure. But you have a spicy way about you on Twitter. Even in this conversation, you know, you had some good, strong words to say about movement. I've always believed life is too short to mince words. One day I'm gonna be dead, and on my deathbed I'm not gonna look back and say, I wish I was a little bit more circumspect in expressing my opinions. I'm far more likely to think, you know what, I wish I said what I really think. Yes, life is too short to hold back your opinion. The question is, what is really your opinion? Because you're many people in one. So there's a person that loves, there's kindness for the human 
y have data on yourself, on your entire cortex and you can control the settings, I think there's probably a large number of things that we could discover about ourselves, very, very small and very, very big. I just, for example, like when you read news, what's going on? Like when you use social media, when you use news, like all the ways we allocate attention. That's right. With the computer. I mean, that seems like a compelling place to where you would want to put on a Kernel, by the way, what is it called? Kernel Flux, Kernel, like what? Flow. Flow. We have two technologies, you or Flow. Flow, okay. So when you put on the Kernel Flow, it seems like to be a compelling time and place to do it is when you're behind a desk, behind a computer. Because you could probably wear it for prolonged periods of time as you're taking in content. And there could a lot of, because so much of our lives happens in the digital world now. That kind of coupling the information about the human mind with the consumption and the behaviors in the digital world might give
verything I do, but there's this engine of joy for life outside of all that. And that has to be chemistry. And this flip side of that is what depression probably is, is the opposite of that feeling of like, cause I bet you that feeling of the cup being amazing would save anybody in a state of depression. Like that would be like fresh, you're in a desert and it's a drink of water, shit man. The brain is a, it would be nice to understand where that's coming from, to be able to understand how you hit those lows and those highs that have nothing to do with the actual reality. It has to do with some very specific aspects of how you maybe see the world, maybe, it could be just like basic habits that you engage in and then how to walk along the line to find those experiences of joy. And this goes back to the discussion we're having of human cognition is in volume, the largest input of raw material into society. And it's not quantified. We have no bearings on it. And so we just, you wonder, we both articulated some of the challenges we have in
top recommended charities. So the idea in general, and sorry to interrupt, is, so we'll talk about sort of poverty and animal welfare and existential risk. Those are all fascinating topics, but in general, the idea is there should be a group, sorry, there's a lot of groups that seek to convert money into good. And then you also on top of that want to have a accounting of how good they actually perform that conversion, how well they did in converting money to good. So ranking of these different groups, ranking these charities. So does that apply across basically all aspects of effective altruism? So there should be a group of people, and they should report on certain metrics of how well they've done, and you should only give your money to groups that do a good job. That's the core idea. I'd make two comments. One is just, it's not just about money. So we're also trying to encourage people to work in areas where they'll have the biggest impact. Absolutely. And in some areas, you know, they're really people heavy, but money poor. Other areas are ki
 wrong, by the way, which is that there are certain kinds of meanings that are more important, let's say religious types, and that we didn't pay sufficient attention to that in our early days. So can you try to elucidate like what his worldview is? Because he's also a religious man. And so what what was this? What was some of the interesting aspects of the disagreements that then? Yeah, well, back in the day, I just said, you know, Jordan was a young punk. We were young punks. He was just kind of flailing in an animated way at some conferences saying that we you're still both kind of punks. Yeah, we are kind of punk. So I saw him three or four years ago. We spoke on a it was an awesome day. We're in Canada at the Ontario Shakespeare Festival, where we were asked to be on a Canadian broadcast system program. I think we were talking about Macbeth from a psychodynamic perspective. And I hadn't seen him in a ton of years. And we spent two days together, had a great time. You know, we had just written our book, The Worm at the Core. And he's like, you
nating from underneath the pile. And it was just surreal and truly like a war zone. I mean, I was a soldier in the reserves. And I never saw combat. And I would never claim that I did. But we trained. We trained for a lot of situations. And we trained in real life atmospheres and whatnot. And this was just beyond that by leaps and bounds. It was bizarre. Did you see the towers collapse? As we were coming over the bridge, the first one, as we were deploying from the firehouse, we had a television on. And I saw it go down. And we were so involved in getting gear together and getting teams set up and, OK, you're going to be with these two guys. And I just yelled, there's the guys. And they're looking at me. I dropped to my knees. And I started praying. They're like, what the hell's wrong? I said, I couldn't even say. I was like, 114, they're in there. And they're like, what? I said, the tower's gone. And all you saw on the TV was just this pile of dust. And I guess because they didn't see it going down, they probably thought I truly lost it. And then the realizat
ke you said, beings of pure energy. I think of life as just complex systems, and the kind of forms those complex systems can take seems to be much larger than the particular biological systems we see here on Earth. I have to ask a Twitter question about aliens. You ready? This is for Twitter. I'm ready. What would you expect from Twitter? Can humans have sex with aliens? Neil Stevenson. You could pass. I asked a language question. Can they communicate? Yeah. Can they fall in love before sex? That's how it works. So which question am I answering? The sex or the love? I mean, it depends what is more fundamental to relations across intelligent species. Yeah. I mean, sex can mean a lot of things. So I mean, if you're... Your production, right? You know, in Star Trek, in classic Star Trek, you had to really suspend your disbelief to think that Spock was half Vulcan and half human, right? Because that's just not going to work DNA wise. So if by sex, you mean reproductive sex, then I would say no, unless you go to a panspermia kind of theory, which is that, yo
I hope also in our technology of engineering intelligence, I think, at least, at least for me, and I'm sure there's a lot of other people like me that your work has been a gift for so well, thank you. Oh, I like that. And we have described ourselves as giant interneurons. I'm like, we have had no original ideas. And maybe that's the only thing that's original about our work is we don't claim to be original. What we claim to have done is to integrate and to connect these disparate and superficially unconnected discourses, you know, so existentialists, they'd be like, evidence? What's that? And yeah, there's now a branch of psychology, experimental, existential psychology that I think we could take credit for having encouraged the formation of. And that, in turn, has gotten these ideas in circulation and academic communities where they may not have otherwise gotten. So I think that's good. Well, Sheldon, it's a huge honor. I can't believe you came down here. I've been a fan of your work. I hope we get to talk again. Huge honor to talk to you. Thank you so 
t few centuries across all the different nations, nearly to 100% across many of the nations in the world. It's gone way up. Average years of education have gone way up. Life expectancy is also increasing. Life expectancy was 48 in 1900. And it's over 80 now. And it's gonna continue to go up, particularly as we get into more advanced stages of simulated biology. For life expectancy, these trends are the same for at birth, age one, age five, age 10, so it's not just the infant mortality. And I have 50 more graphs in the book about all kinds of things. Even spread of democracy, which might bring up some sort of controversial issues, it still has gone way up. Well, that one has gone way up, but that one is a bumpy road, right? Exactly, and somebody might represent democracy and go backwards, but we basically had no democracies before the creation of the United States, which was a little over two centuries ago, which in the scale of human history isn't that long. Do you think superintelligence systems will help with democracy? So what is democracy? Democracy is gi
 would have a whole set of other things in the bed with him. And who knows how many other people, but anyway. And then he said in his autobiography, and I'm paraphrasing here, but one morning I woke up and I realized that the tape had recorded all the way to the end. So I rewound the tape and I hit play. And there in some kind of ghostly form were the opening chords to Satisfaction, the most famous successful Rolling Stone song of all time. Followed by then 43 minutes of snoring. That's awesome. That riff came to him. One of the most famous riffs in all of rock and roll came to him by way of a dream inspired insight. So I think there is too many of those anecdotes. And we've now got the side, I don't rely on anecdotes as science. We've now done the studies in the laboratory and we can reliably demonstrate that sleep inspires creativity, inspires problem solving capacity. Well, the interesting thing is, is it possible to some of the ideas that you talk about to turn them into a protocol that could be practiced rigorously? So what Jim Kel
e AI brain? Exactly. And the AI brain is really an emulation of human beings. I mean, that's why we're creating them, because human beings act the same way, and this is basically to amplify them. I mean, this amplifies our brain. It's a little bit clumsy to interact with, but it definitely is way beyond what we had 15 years ago. But the implementation becomes different, just like a bird versus the airplane, even though the AI brain is an emulation, it starts adding features we might not otherwise have, like ability to consume a huge amount of information quickly, like look up thousands of Wikipedia articles in one take. Exactly. I mean, we can get, for example, issues like simulated biology, where it can simulate many different things at once. We already had one example of simulated biology, which is the Moderna vaccine. And that's gonna be now the way in which we create medications. But they were able to simulate what each example of an mRNA would do to a human being, and they were able to simulate that quite reliably. And we actually simula
t necessary for the work we're doing here. I don't think I need to solve that problem to build intelligent machines at all, not at all. But there is sort of the silly notion that you described briefly that doesn't seem so silly to us humans is, if you're successful building intelligent machines, it feels wrong to then turn them off. Because if you're able to build a lot of them, it feels wrong to then be able to turn off the... Well, why? Let's break that down a bit. As humans, why do we fear death? There's two reasons we fear death. Well, first of all, I'll say, when you're dead, it doesn't matter at all. Who cares? You're dead. So why do we fear death? We fear death for two reasons. One is because we are programmed genetically to fear death. That's a survival and pop beginning of the genes thing. And we also are programmed to feel sad when people we know die. We don't feel sad for someone we don't know dies. There's people dying right now, they're only just gonna say, I don't feel bad about them, because I don't know them. But if I knew them, I'd feel really 
here's a goal state, there's a, you reached an end point. But the thing is, making that end a thing that's also within the program, like making the thing, and then it's also the mystery of it. So the thing is, we don't know what the hell this death thing is. I mean, it's not like we, I mean, the program doesn't give us information about the meaning of it all. And that's where the terror is. And it feels like, I mean, in the language that you would think about is the terror of this death, or like anticipation of it, or thinking about it, is the creative force that builds everything. Right. And that feels like, you know, that feels really important to implement. Again, it's very difficult to know how to do technically, currently, but it's important to think about. What I find is, you mentioned like screenplays and so on, is sci fi folks and philosophers are the the only ones thinking about it currently. And that's what these folks have convinced me. Yeah. And engineers aren't, which is, I get, yeah, most of the things I talk about, I get kind of people roll th
ople of the chance to live a life that makes life better, you know? It's truly criminal to tell poor countries that they should not consume the same energy sources that are being used in rich countries on which our modern infrastructure and modern life relies. That's what life is. You know, if you reduce the consumption of energy in the US to the levels that you have in poor countries today, the US would become desperately poor. A lot of people would die. Cities would collapse. The quality of life would decrease significantly. A high quality of life often requires, given the current technology, a high expenditure of energy. Yeah, and I should be clear, you know, it's not a quality of life in the sense of, many people think of this as, oh yeah, well, you know, taking needless flights for vacations. No, no, these are the cherries on top of the cake, but the substance of the cake and the real benefits of energy is the fact that children, premature babies, survive in countries that have reliable 24 hour cheap electricity. If your child is born p
d that's their job. But we've realized how polygenic the diseases are, so we can't have one postdoc per gene anymore. We now have to have these cross cutting needs. And I'm going to describe the path to circuitry along those needs. And every single one of these paths, we are now doing in parallel across thousands of genes. So the first step is you have a genetic association, and we talked a little bit about sort of the Mendelian path and the polygenic path to that association. So the Mendelian path was looking through families to basically find gene regions and ultimately genes that are underlying particular disorders. The polygenic path is basically looking at unrelated individuals in this giant matrix of genotype by phenotype, and then finding hits where a particular variant impacts disease all the way to the end. And then we now have a connection, not between a gene and a disease, but between a genetic region and a disease. And that distinction is not understood by most people. So I'm going to explain it a little bit more. Why 
cond? When it comes to sleep, we have found huge amounts of into individual differences in your response to a lack of sleep. But one of the fascinating things, so let's say that I take you and we're going to measure your attention, your emotion, your mood, your blood pressure, your blood sugar glucose regulation, your autonomic nervous system and your different gene expression. Let's say I'm just going to measure a whole kaleidoscope of different outcomes, brain and body. And I find that on our measure of cognition on your attentional ability to focus, you are very resilient. You just don't show any impairment at all even after being awake for 36 hours straight. Does that mean that you are resilient in all of those other domains as well? The answer is no, you're not. So you can be resilient in one, but very vulnerable in another. And we've not found anyone who isn't at least vulnerable in one of those domains, meaning that it's somewhat safe to say that not getting sufficient sleep will lead to some kind of impairment in any one given indiv
ourse, becomes stronger and we can learn more in simulation. But there's also another version which is where you say the simulator doesn't even have to be that precise. As long as it's somewhat representative and instead of trying to get one simulator that is sufficiently precise to learn in and transfer really well to the real world, I'm gonna build many simulators. Ensemble of simulators? Ensemble of simulators. Not any single one of them is sufficiently representative of the real world such that it would work if you train in there. But if you train in all of them, then there is something that's good in all of them. The real world will just be another one of them that's not identical to any one of them but just another one of them. Another sample from the distribution of simulators. Exactly. We do live in a simulation, so this is just one other one. I'm not sure about that, but yeah. It's definitely a very advanced simulator if it is. Yeah, it's a pretty good one. I've talked to Stuart Russell. It's something you think about a little bit 
 some of the theories of how the whole thing works. And you're saying, as we understand more and more about the neocortex, about our own human mind, we'll be able to start to more specifically define what it means to be intelligent. It's not useful to really talk about that until. I don't know if it's not useful. Look, there's a long history of AI, as you know. And there's been different approaches taken to it. And who knows, maybe they're all useful. So the good old fashioned AI, the expert systems, the current convolutional neural networks, they all have their utility. They all have a value in the world. But I would think almost everyone agree that none of them are really intelligent in a sort of a deep way that humans are. And so it's just the question of how do you get from where those systems were or are today to where a lot of people think we're gonna go. And there's a big, big gap there, a huge gap. And I think the quickest way of bridging that gap is to figure out how the brain does that. And then we can sit back and look and say, oh, wh
rochemistry, whatever the hell that is, whatever, maybe probably is rooted to the fact that I grew up in the Soviet Union and it was such a constrained system that you'd really deeply value freedom and you always want to escape the man and the control of centralized systems. I don't know what it is, but at the same time, I love strictness. I love the dogmatic authoritarianism of diet, of like the same habit, exactly the habit you have. I think that's actually when bodies perform optimally, my body performs optimally. So balancing those two, I think if I have the data, every once in a while, party with some wild people, but most of the time eat once a day, perhaps in the morning, I'm gonna try that. That might be very interesting, but I'd rather not try it. I'd rather have the data that tells me to do it. But in general, you're able to, eating once a day, think deeply about stuff like this. Concern that people have is like does your energy wane, all those kinds of things. Do you find that it's, especially because it's unique, it's vegan as well. So y
y that was trying to rebound or there's just maybe there's something we don't know about. So another existential risk comes from the mysterious the beautiful artificial intelligence. Yeah. So what what's the shape of your concerns about AI? I think there are quite a lot of concerns about AI and sometimes the different risks don't get distinguished enough. So the kind of classic worry most is closely associated with Nick Bostrom and Elias Joukowski is that we at some point move from having narrow AI systems to artificial general intelligence. You get this very fast feedback effect where AGI is able to build, you know, artificial intelligence helps you to build greater artificial intelligence. We have this one system that suddenly very powerful far more powerful than others than perhaps far more powerful than, you know, the rest of the world combined and then secondly, it has goals that are misaligned with human goals. And so it pursues its own goals. It realize, hey, there's this competition namely from humans. It would be better if
o think about it, though, is to map it onto one year. So let's say the universe just linearly mapped the time intervals from 13.8 billion years onto one year. So the Big Bang then is on January 1st at 12 a.m. And you wait for quite a long time before the dinosaurs emerge. The dinosaurs emerge on Christmas, it turns out. And... 12 months, almost 12 months later. Getting close to the end, yes. Getting close to the end. is human robot interaction. And it seems that consciousness from the perspective of the robot is very useful to improve the human robot interaction experience. The first, the display of consciousness, but then to me, there's a gray area between the display of consciousness and consciousness itself. If you think of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective, it seems like a useful tool in human communication, so. Yes, it's certainly, well, whatever consciousness is will turn out to be. I think addressing it through its use and working up from simple cases and also working up from engineering experience in trying to do efficient computat
n dream. In what way? The people who have come to this country, however weird and different they may be, they or their ancestors at some point probably have shared this thing. Right, US is not gonna split up. It may get more screwed up as a country, but Texas and California are not gonna break off. I mean, they're big enough where they could do it, but it's just never gonna happen. We've been through too much together. Yeah. Yeah, that's a hopeful message. Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein, you've talked to Eric Weinstein. He has a sense that growth, like the entirety of the American system is based on the assumption that we're gonna grow forever, that the economy's gonna grow forever. Do you think economic growth will continue indefinitely? Or will we stagnate? I've long been in agreement with Eric, Peter Thiel, Robert Gordon and others, that growth has slowed down. I argued that in my book, The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled. But the last two years, I've become much more optimistic. I've seen a lot of breakthroughs in g
 as an incoherent failing state almost when Putin took over and that he did some important things for Russia's stability and consolidation. There's also some appreciation that Putin stood up to the West and stood up to more powerful countries and regained a sense of pride and maneuverability for Russia in the international system. People appreciate that and it's real. It's not imagined that Putin accomplished that. The problem is the methods that he accomplished it with. He used the kind of methods, that is to say, taking other people's property, putting other people in jail for political reasons. He used the kind of methods that are not conducive to long term growth and stability. So he fixed the problem, but he fixed the problem and then created even bigger long term problems potentially. And moreover, all authoritarian regimes that use those methods are tempted to keep using them and using them and using them until they're the only ones who are the beneficiaries and the group narrows and narrows. The elite gets smaller and na
as since died, fought with terminal cancer for nine years in a wheelchair. Literally at the end, came out of hospice to go finalize getting us this coverage. Detective Luis Alvarez, who testified days before he died in front of Congress, and a bunch of other guys that were really, really sick, and we had to shame these people into signing on. And luckily we had John Stewart come on and literally just hound these guys and shame them and embarrass them. And what it all stemmed from was in 2006, the first death that was determined to be linked to 9 11, there was others, but the first one that was officially linked was a New York City police detective who initially, the city said he died of advanced lung disease. His lungs were protruding out of his body. And he was on painkillers and it was so bad at the end that the doctor said, just grind them up, snort them, drink it, whatever you need to do to get instant relief. So when they found the talcum from the pill lining in his lungs, they said, oh no, this is opiate abuse. He didn't die of lung di
lly were dispatched over towards number seven, had just gone down, and we were searching the post office that was there. There was reports of people trapped. And we painstakingly searched every single inch of that building to make sure no one was left in there. And then we were deployed to the pile, and the pile is sort of ambiguous because it was just such a vast, vast pile. I mean, it went for city blocks. And we were assisting in the retrieval of two Port Authority police officers. We're lucky enough to survive, but they were trapped. They were deep down into a crevasse, and they had to be physically dug out and extricated. So there was a couple hundred, few hundred guys involved in that process of bringing in equipment, jaws of life, airbags to lift steel, to cut pieces of steel. It was just a huge operation. And we were back toward the logistics end of it, shuttling in gear and bringing in stretchers, bringing in oxygen, whatever was needed. And you were trying to climb over this jagged pile of debris. It wasn't like you just walke
e. But even then, at times, it's socially unacceptable. So I beat Sem Schilt. He cut my right eyebrow. I cut him and busted his nose, and he's bleeding all over me as I have an armbar on top. I'm getting, you know, it's raining blood. Quote some slayer from a lacerated Sem Schilt, bleeding in his horror, creating my structures. Now I shall rain him blood. But I win the fight, armbar, nasty one. I get on my feet, and the first thing I do is I wipe all the blood off onto my hands, and I lick it, and I do my thing. And all the MMA journalists freaked out. Dana Wise, like, man, I don't know about that. You know, we don't want him doing, everybody had this huge problem. And then some folks would even contend, oh, you know, you're trying to do, like, no, no, no, this isn't planned. I don't think of these things. This is how I really feel. This is who I really am. And, you know, it was even kind of comical after the fact, you know, and BJ Penn was on the very card with me, watching him at some point in his career all of a sudden win fights and then do this licking the gl
 you put Royce Gracie in the top 10? There's something about... Top 10 of all time in terms of competitors is capable. I don't know. I'd have to think about that. Maybe not, but I put Royce Gracie as like pyramid level. Like, wow, dude, what an amazing man. Yeah, he's so important. Absolutely, incredibly important. But there's something about stepping into, like fighting another human being under all the uncertainty that the early UFCs had. I mean, you don't know. Yup. What is going to happen? And coupled that with not much money. Yup. All of it. Yes. So the purity of it too. There's something about money. I mean, I guess it's shit for that cat post world, but that ruins the purity of the violence. Yeah, people given the opportunity for... Yeah, yeah. The bigger things get, the more... I love the fact that fighting has opened up to such a degree that the career business side of it, because I absolutely distinctly separate the two. The business side of it has opened up to give me far more possibilities, opened way more doors for me than I ever intended it to. Whereas
mber of things. Okay, I mean, burn their own house down and then say, you know, we were attacked. And then it comes down, oh, you did it to yourself because you wanted money and empathy and this, that. And you wanted all this emotional wealth, let's say this emotional coin, as well as actual if possible. You wanted to leverage it in some way. That's not the majority of people, but I would say a good amount of folks are thinking, well, if I post this photo and I put this little blurb in there, I bet I can get this much cache out of it in this sense. And I'm not even, and this isn't just a reference to like butt pics and stuff like that. Because clearly, obviously people understand that our inborn sexual nature is easy to manipulate. I mean, that's pretty obvious. But you're saying this kind of new medium of communication on social media is unnatural. And it preys on us. And so as you want this, you know, you look at an anarchist kind of mindset, right? And so you're just like, there's no, there is no overarching state to create any kind of a structur
s in so much pain. And I wouldn't take a painkiller because I know people with some issues and I just didn't want to go there. And finally on the last day I gave in, I said, please, I can't do this anymore. I was literally like jumping out of my skin and they gave me something. But it had burned out my mind, it burned out my body. I couldn't hear, I could barely see, it was vicious. But it worked. And my nurses especially, they just, they were so dedicated and devoted. And I was not an easy patient because I was in a lot of pain. It was bad and it was, drove my friends, my family crazy. It was just, it wasn't good. But on that first night I had a quick vision of all these people that I loved that were dead, that died. A lot of them in a trade center and I saw Johnny, I saw friends I grew up with. The last one was my mother in law who had passed six months before and she died of, she was in a coma, she had a stroke. She had a horrible, horrible last six months of life and it wasn't fair because she was so religious. She went to church every day, d
someone might make a funny remark or a not so funny remark or something would happen and you might then at that moment make eye contact with someone you didn't know at the other end of the table. In that moment, you would realize this person is reacting. This person heard what I heard. They're reacting the way I reacted. Nobody else appears to get the joke or to understand what just happened, but random stranger down there and I, we have this connection and then you build on that. So then the next time something happens, you automatically look at your new friend and they look back at you and before you know it, you're hanging out together because you know you've already established without even talking to each other that you're on the same wavelength. Yeah. It's seemingly so simple, but so powerful that establishing that you're on the same wavelength at some level. There's no reason why you and a toaster can't have that. I'm just saying. Does this smell burned to you? Exactly. I think it's burnt. If a toaster could just say that to you. Ye
ay, I feel some relief. I turned on Eminem and I made it to the summit after five hours, but just 100 yards from the top. I was with my guide Ike and I started getting very dizzy and I felt like I was gonna fall backwards off this cliff area we were on. I was like, this is dangerous. And he said, look, Brian, I know where you're at. I know where you're at. And I can tell you, you've got it in you. So I want you to look up, take a step, take a breath and look up, take a breath and take a step. And I did and I made it. And so I got there and I just sat down with him at the top. I just cried like a baby. Broke down. Yeah, I just lost it. And so he'd let me do my thing. And then we pulled out the pulse oximeter and he measured my blood oxygen levels and it was like 50 something percent and it was danger zone. So he looked at it and I think he was like really alarmed that I was in this situation. And so he said, we can't get a helicopter here and we can't get you emergency evacuated. You've gotta go down. You've gotta hike down to 15,000 feet to get base camp. An
tcome that's different than other groups, and then drawing conclusions about fundamental unfairness, injustice, inequality in the system. So like systematic racism, systematic sexism, systematic anything else that creates inequality. And he's been kind of saying pretty simple things to say that, you know, the system for the most part is not broken or flawed, that the inequalities part, the inequality of outcomes is part of our world. What we should strive for is the, you know, equality of opportunity. Yeah, and I do not dispute that as an abstraction. But again, to back up for a second, I do take issue with Jordan's fervent devotion to the free market and his cavalier dismissal of Marxist ideas, which he has, in my estimation, mischaracterized in his public depictions. Let's get into it. So he just seems to really not like socialism, Marxism, communism. Historically speaking, sort of, I mean, how would I characterize it? I'm not exactly sure. I don't want to, again, he'll eventually be here to defend himself. John Locke, unfortunately, not here to defe
er, the councils known as the Soviets are going to take their place, and Lenin seizes power in the name of the Soviets. So it's a coup against the left, against the rest of the left, not against the provisional government that has replaced the czar, which has already failed. And so Stalin is able to come to power along with Lenin in this crazy seizure of power on the left against the rest of the left in October 1917, which we know is the October Revolution, and I call the October coup as many other historians call. The October Revolution happened after the seizure of power. What's interesting about this episode is that the leftists who seize power in the name of the Soviets, in the name of the masses, in the name of people's power, they retain their hold. Many times in history, there's a seizure of power by the left, and they fail. They collapse. They're cleaned out by an army or what we call forces of order, by counter revolutionary forces. Lenin's revolution, Lenin's coup is successful. It is able to hold power, not just seize power. They win
 is they don't, the hate's already there, but they take the fears and they expertly redirect them to who it is that I need to hate and kill in order to feel good about myself. So back to your point, Lex, that's right. So the self regard that used to come from having a job and doing it well, and as a result of that, having adequate resources to provide a decent life for your family, well, those opportunities are gone. And yeah, what's left? So Max Weber, German sociologist at the beginning of the 20th century, he said in times of historical upheaval, we are apt to embrace, he was the one who coined the term charismatic leader, seemingly larger than life individuals who often believe or their followers believe are divinely ordained to rid the world of evil. All right, now, Ernest Becker, he used Weber's ideas in order to account for the rise of Hitler. Hitler was elected, and he was elected when Germans were in an extraordinary state of existential distress, and he said, I'm gonna make Germany great again. All right, now, what Becker adds to the e
nts with at high energy accelerators to take a movie that looked different when you ran it backwards. This was a discovery by two great physicists named Jim Cronin and Val Fitch in the mid 1960s. Previous to that, over all the centuries of development of physics with all its precise laws, they did seem to have this gratuitous property that they look the same if you run the equations backwards. It's kind of an embarrassing property actually because life isn't like that. So empirical reality does not have this imagery in any obvious way. And yet the laws did. It's almost like the laws of physics are missing something fundamental about life if it holds that property, right? Well, that's the embarrassing nature of it. Yeah, it's embarrassing. Well, people worked hard at what's, this is a problem that's thought to belong to the foundations of statistical mechanics or the foundations of thermodynamics to understand how behavior, which is grossly not symmetric with respect to reversing the direction of time in large objects, how that can emerge
in many ways amputated your own possibilities by virtue of choices that you've made or just as often have declined to make because you are reluctant to accept responsibility for the opportunities that you are now able to create by virtue of seeing the possibilities that lay before you. So anyway, Heidegger then says, look, OK, so, you know, I'm a professor and I live in America in the 21st century. Well, if I was in the third century living in a year in Mongolia, I'm not going to have an opportunity to be a professor. But what he submits is that there is some aspects of whatever I am that are independent of my cultural and historical circumstances. In other words, there is a me of sorts. Heidegger would take vigorous issue and so would Heidegger's scholars because I'm not claiming to understand him. This is my classic comic book rendering. But Heidegger's point is that you get to the point where you're able to say, OK, I am a contingent historical and cultural artifact. But so what? You know, if I was, you know, if I was transported a thous
 to own, on tape, the original. VHS? The original cut, yeah. And I had the director's cut on DVD. Why Blade Runner, by the way? What connects you to it? As a kid, I just thought it was so cool. There was something about it that really spoke to me. The whole cyberpunk landscapes and this guy chasing down rogue androids, replicants, and all this. Is it just the entire cyberpunk universe or is it just robots as well? No, I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it. On the surface, I've always tended towards dark subject matter. Things that are of the dark, so to speak, are things that I've always been gravitated towards. I think maybe part of it is that things that are darker are more accepting and more upfront with death. what is becoming first principles to most people. But wait, wait, but you could also argue though, those riots were more like the madness of crowds, which is definitely a lot more than just that. I'm just saying that given a chance, it's like, okay, boom, the lights are off, the grid is down. We've hacked into the whole system, turned i
nd I don't know the exact number of those folks who did that, but our first member of the fire department killed firefighter Daniel Serf, aged 216, was struck by a jumper. And one of my dear friends was ordered to help take him and they knew he was passed away because he was hit by a flying missile. I mean, 120 miles an hour, a body lands on you. Those two bodies are now crushed. And they were ordered to take that firefighter and bring him across the street to Engine 10, Ladder 10. It was literally a firehouse, less than 100 yards from the facade of the Trade Center, from the Trade Center complex. They were literally right there. And there was plane parts that went into that firehouse, landed into the front doors onto the roof, but the building itself was not destroyed. So it was used as a mini command center for quite a while. So my friend was ordered to take Daniel's body in respect and bring it over to this firehouse and give it some semblance of dignity and lay it out on one of the bunk rooms, the bunks we have in the bunkhouse, and just co
f opportunity. And I said, it's never too late. He goes, yeah, but you know what? You get tied down. And I understand that. I thank God my mom came here at 16. I thank God my grandpa got on that ship. But in his 20s, 27, I think, you know, with not a nickel to rub together. I thank God they did it. Cause I don't know where else I would have ended up. There's no place else I want to be. And I thank God that there's people like you who rushed towards ground zero to help other human beings. And I believe that that human spirit is ultimately represents the best of this country and the best of this world. Thank you for the stories you're telling, for your perseverance in that. And thank you for welcoming me to the crew. You're very welcome. I'm proud. And we'll take you any day. You look like you could do the job just fine. I love lifting heavy things and doing dangerous things. So I'm proud to be part of this country and part of the Tally Ho now. Well, you are definitely an attribute to America and we're glad you chose to come here. You know, Lex, it's such a be
t? It's just so often correlated with other life decisions when you choose to eat meat or not. My sense is that whatever life decisions you make, if they reduce stress and lead to happiness, that's also going to be a big boost that needs to be integrated into the plots in the science, right? So I'll give you an example of somebody who is unarguably seen as unhealthy. My friend, Mr. David Goggins. So he's clearly, obviously, almost on purpose destroying his body. He's destroying his body and to say that he's doing the wrong thing or the unhealthy thing feels like, feels wrong. But I'm not sure exactly in which way he feels wrong. One of the things I'm bothered by, and again, I apologize for the therapy sessions, a framework of this, but I'm bothered by the fact that a lot of people tell me or David that they're doing things wrong. A lot of people in my life, when they see me not sleep, they'll tell me to sleep more. Now they're correct, but one fundamental aspect that I'd like to complain about is not enough people, almost nobody, especially people 
are that violence produces a nonviolent, sustainable, positive outcome. It happens, but it doesn't happen frequently. Mental upheaval is not a way always to institutionalize a better path forward because you need institutions. People can protest as they did throughout the Middle East, and the protests didn't necessarily lead to better systems because the step from protest to new, strong, consolidated institutions is a colossal leap, not a small step. What we need and what we see from history and situations like this is a group within the power structures, which is a patriotic that sees things going down. That is to say that sees things not being developing relative to neighbors, relative to richer countries, relative to more successful countries, and they want to change the trajectory of Russia. And if they can, in a coalition fashion, unseat the current regime for a new power sharing arrangement, which once again can be frustrating because you can't do changes immediately, you can't do things overnight, but that's the point. Constraint
e you to use some of that money to help others. So it's quite understandable in the psychological terms, even if it's not the right thing that we ought to be doing. So how can we do better? How can we be more effective? How does data help? Yeah, in general, how can we do better? It's definitely hard. And we have spent the last 10 years engaged in kind of some deep research projects, to try and answer kind of two questions. One is, of all the many problems the world is facing, what are the problems we ought to be focused on? And then within those problems that we judge to be kind of the most pressing, where we use this idea of focusing on problems that are the biggest in scale, that are the most tractable, where we can make the most progress on that problem, and that are the most neglected. Within them, what are the things that have the kind of best evidence, or we have the best guess, will do the most good. And so we have a bunch of organizations. So GiveWell, for example, is focused on global health and development, and has a list of seven 
it's synaptic pruning, it's calcium signaling and so on and so forth. So when you look at disease genetics, you have one hit here and one hit there and one hit there and one hit there, completely different parts of the genome. But it turns out all of those hits are calcium signaling proteins. Oh, cool. You're like, aha. That means that calcium signaling is important. So those people who are focusing on one doctor at a time cannot possibly see that picture. You have to become a genomicist. You have to look at the omics, the om, the holistic picture to understand these enrichments. But you mentioned the convergence thing. The whatever the thing associated with the disease shows up. So let me explain convergence. Convergence is such a beautiful concept. So you basically have these four genes that are converging on calcium signaling. So that basically means that they are acting each in their own way, but together in the same process. But now in every one of these loci, you have many enhancers controlling each of those genes. That's another t
 would those be? You were just talking about frequencies. We know by evolution, our bodies know, it's the audio band. Okay, the reason our ears work where they work is that's where the Earth isn't going, making too much noise. Okay, so the reason our ears work the way they work is because this is where it's quiet. That's right. So if you go to one Hertz instead of 10 Hertz, the Earth is really moving around. So somehow we live in what we call the audio band. It's tens of Hertz to thousands of Hertz. That's where we live, okay? If we're going to do an experiment on the Earth, it's the same frequency. That's where the Earth is the quietest. So we have to work in that frequency. So we're not looking at all frequencies, okay? So the solution for the shaking of the Earth to get rid of it is pretty mundane if we do the same thing that you do to make your car drive smoothly down the road. So what happens when your car goes over a bump? Early cars did that, they bounced. Right. Okay, but you don't feel that in your car. So what happened to that energy? You can't
 the even bigger deal that you learn something that was reusable, which was not often the case before. Usually machine learning, you learn something for one scenario and that was it. And that's really exciting. I mean, that's a huge application. That's probably the biggest success of transfer learning today in terms of scope and impact. That was a huge breakthrough. And then recently, I feel like similar kind of, by scaling things up, it seems like this has been expanded upon. Like people training even bigger networks, they might transfer even better. If you looked at, for example, some of the OpenAI results on language models and some of the recent Google results on language models, they're learned for just prediction and then they get reused for other tasks. And so I think there is something there where somehow if you train a big enough model on enough things, it seems to transfer some deep mind results that I thought were very impressive, the Unreal results, where it was learned to navigate mazes in ways where it wasn't just doing r
tish philosopher and here in the States. I don't know where he is these days, but Robert J. Lifton, the psycho historian. Yeah, they're both of my view and which I hope is, by the way, wrong. Me too. Yeah, no, but you know, between, you know, ongoing ethnic tensions, environmental degradation, economic instability, and the fact that, you know, the world has become a Petri dish of psychopathology. Like what really worries me is the the quiet economic pain that people are going through, the businesses that are closed, dreams that are broken, because you can no longer do the thing that you've wanted to do and how I mentioned to you off camera that I've been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. And I mean, the amount of anger and hatred and on the flip side of that, sort of a nationalist pride that can arise from deep economic pain. Like what happens with that economic pain is you become bitter. You start to find the other, whether it's other European nations that mistreated you, whether it's other groups that mistreated you, it always ends 
hat it's not. A foreign ideology came in with the idea that this country needs to be occupied by people from only one religion and the existing population, which, I mean, Jews had always lived in Palestine historically. And at the turn of the 20th century, they were only 10% of the population. But then with the birth of fiat money, incidentally, the link with all of this is that when the Bank of England went off gold, a big reason why they were able to pull that off was that the Rothschild banking family supported them. And in exchange, the Rothschilds got Palestine. And the Balfour Declaration was written by the government of Britain to the Rothschild family, telling them that they'd like to make Palestine a homeland for Jews. So obviously that's not very convenient for people who are not Jewish, for whom that is a homeland. And the past 80 years has been a very painful struggle. If you happen to not be Jewish. And obviously, you know, obviously Palestinians have done all kinds of things trying to fight back and they've done all kinds of w
s you do, and then what? And so you do this now, it feels good today, but then what happens tomorrow? You go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself, well, think about the hangover. But more in longterm, think about the implication of living this kind of life. Think about every decision that you make, the longterm implication of it. And part of that is Bitcoin, part of that is save in Bitcoin. I urge everybody to put savings in Bitcoin for the longterm. Don't buy Bitcoin for the short term, don't buy Bitcoin today so that you can sell it, don't put your savings in Bitcoin today so that you can sell it all next month and buy a house. Put money in Bitcoin that you expect to keep in Bitcoin for another five, 10 years or so, at least four years is what I recommend for people. So keep a low time preference, focus on the future, and save in Bitcoin. And learn about how to buy Bitcoin, how to learn about all this technology. Part of this is this conversation, but there's so much awesome material out there. And thank you, by the way, for this gift of a hardwa
that then drive the models. So how do these perturbations allow you to understand disease? So if you know that a gene is related to disease, you don't want to just know that it's related to the disease. You want to know what is the disease mechanism because you want to go and intervene. So the way that I like to describe it is that traditionally epidemiology, which is basically the study of disease, you know, sort of the observational study of disease has been about correlating one thing with another thing. So if you have a lot of people with liver disease who are also alcoholics, you might say, well, maybe the alcoholism is driving the liver disease or maybe those who have liver disease self medicate with alcohol. So the connection could be either way. With genetic epidemiology, it's about correlating changes in genome with phenotypic differences and then you know the direction of causality. So if you know that a particular gene is related to the disease, you can basically say, okay, perturbing that gene in mouse causes the mice 
n't have speech though, they might warn each other, they might make a sound that says danger, danger, um, but, uh, but as far as we know, they can't tell more complicated stories. So it's a part of us. Yeah. I, the, the, the collective intelligence seems to be one of the key characteristics of the, of homo sapiens, the ability to share ideas and hold ideas together in our minds and storytelling is the fundamental aspect of that. Maybe even language itself is more fundamental because the language is required to do the storytelling or maybe they evolve together. Maybe they co evolve. Yeah. So I think that you've got to work with that and I think, uh, sometimes it seems like in kind of, um, literary circles that having a lot of plot is a little bit frowned upon as it's pulpy or it's exploitative, but, um, for me, I don't have any compunctions whatsoever about that. I like stories that, um, are grabby and fun and exciting to read. And once you've got one of those going, once you've got a good yarn going that people will enjoy reading, then you're free to d
g. So this idea of synaptogenesis, the growth of new synapses, that's well described, it's well understood. And that's an essential part of learning. That is learning. That is learning. Okay. Going back many, many years, people, you know, it was, what's his name, the psychologist who proposed, Hebb, Donald Hebb. He proposed that learning was the modification of the strength of a connection between two neurons. People interpreted that as the modification of the strength of a synapse. He didn't say that. He just said there's a modification between the effect of one neuron and another. So synaptogenesis is totally consistent with what Donald Hebb said. But anyway, there's these mechanisms, the growth of new synapses. You can go online, you can watch a video of a synapse growing in real time. It's literally, you can see this little thing going boop. It's pretty impressive. So those mechanisms are known. Now there's another thing that we've speculated and we've written about, which is consistent with known neuroscience, but it's less proven. And this is the ide
about sort of what do we use, what are the most important diseases, you have to understand both the quality of life and the sheer number of deaths and just numbers of years lost if you wish. And each of these diseases you can think of as, and also including terrorist attacks and school shootings, for example, things which lead to fatalities, you can look at as problems that could be solved. And some problems are harder to solve than others. I mean, that's part of the equation. So maybe if you look at these diseases, if you look at heart disease or cancer or Alzheimer's or just like schizophrenia and obesity, Debbie, like not necessarily things that kill you, but affect the quality of life, which problems are solvable, which aren't, which are harder of 384 cells. That sounds amazing and it was amazing, but we want to do a million cells. How do you go from these wells to a million cells? You can't. So what the next technology was after that is instead of using a well for every reaction, you now use a lipid droplet for every reaction. So you u
 function to it. And we've now since discovered that dreams have a function. The first, as we mentioned, creativity. The second is that dreams provide a form of overnight therapy. Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid. And it's during dream sleep at night that we take these difficult, painful experiences that we've had during the day, sometimes traumatic, and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm. And it sort of just takes the sharp edges off those difficult, painful experiences so that you come back the next day and you feel better about them. And so I think in that sense, dreaming, it's not time that heals all wounds. It's time during dream sleep that provides emotional convalescence. So dreaming is almost a form of emotional windscreen wipers. And I think, and by the way, it's not just that you dream. It's what you dream about that also matters. So for example, scientists have done studies with learning and memory where they have people learn a virtual maze. And what they discovered was that those people who then dr
able to plan the world economy and make it work better. And then you start actually trying to solve problems, trying to actually calculate them. And you realize nobody can have that ability because the difference ultimately comes down to the fact we can't have experiments. And the reason we can't have experiments is that you can experiment on particles of a gas. You can't experiment on human beings and entire economies. And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter. And so you kick matter in a certain way. You can calculate exactly how much is going to fly. Human beings are much more complex. They have a will inside them. And this is really, this is the humility to understand that you are a human being and other people are also human being just like you. And that every person wakes up every morning and they have a million things in their mind, a million things they care about, a million things they want to do. And you will never be able to make the decisions for somebody else, let alone for millions of other people. So this
hysical and athletic faculties to survive because this isn't the first and it's definitely not gonna be the last, especially if you're the slowest one. What is it, there's a lyric from a clutch song. Don't go for the fat ones, just go for the slow ones. Oh man, but that's the universal truth of the way nature works. You said it's not cruel, it's not cruel, it's just the way it is. Yeah, I mean, watch animals getting into fights on any of these sort of documentary stuff. You'll see an intense short and then dispersal. You'll see as soon as one feels like things have switched just enough to boom, the bear or whatever it is takes off. It's like, I'm done with this. Because if you can get out of there with just some scars and what have you, okay. You lose an eye, nah, it's not as good. You really get hurt bad and get infected, you're done. So there's a serious risk to be that can come with these sort of things. Yet, I believe that we are inherently born for at least aspects of and use of violence. And so at the end of the day, we need these things not just t
just like constantly thoughts driving you crazy. But over time, you know, knock wood, I've kind of gotten better at it. And I can sort of let go of those, that part of me that's trying so hard. And so these angels can speak a little more easily through the membrane. Can you put into words the process of letting go and clearing that channel of communication? What does it take? That's another great question. For me, it just took, it took probably 30 years. And I don't even, I guess I would liken it to meditation, even though I'm not a meditator. But it would seem to me to be one of the hardest things in the world to just sit still and stop thinking, right? And so it's very hard to put into words. And I think that's why these teachers of meditation use tricks and koans and stuff like that. But for me, at least, I think it was just a process of years of years and years of trying, and finally beating my head in the wall. And finally, little by little giving up the beating of the head. But there doesn't seem to be any trick. Everybody wants a hack thes
seemed to me like magic. It was beautiful. So that seemed like what intelligence is, RL reinforcement learning. So how do you think we can possibly learn anything about the world when the reward for the actions is delayed, is so sparse? Like where is, why do you think RL works? Why do you think you can learn anything under such sparse rewards, whether it's regular reinforcement learning or deep reinforcement learning? What's your intuition? The counterpart of that is why is RL, why does it need so many samples, so many experiences to learn from? Because really what's happening is when you have a sparse reward, you do something maybe for like, I don't know, you take 100 actions and then you get a reward. And maybe you get like a score of three. And I'm like okay, three, not sure what that means. You go again and now you get two. And now you know that that sequence of 100 actions that you did the second time around somehow was worse than the sequence of 100 actions you did the first time around. But that's tough to now know which one of those were b
the criminal thing about it. Like I've already earned that money being a doctor, being a dentist, being an athlete, being an engineer. I built a house for somebody and I got that money. And all I wanna do is just make sure that I can have it 10 years from now. The only way to do so is to become a crappy engineer because you have to spend half your time not doing engineering and instead spend half of that time learning about Japanese central bank monetary policy and commodity markets and what's gonna happen to copper and what's gonna happen to oil and what's happening in the wars and what's happening with foreign policy and Russia and the US and all of those things. Under the gold standard, you didn't care about any of that stuff. Your gold coin worked regardless of all of those things. So what this means is the future, so first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned, but also it means that the future becomes much more uncertain. So you're far less likely to provide for yourself 10 years from now, far less likely to find an eas
f that enhancer and then see what is the impact on that gene. So these are the four ways of linking the locus to the target gene, and that's step number five. Step number five is find the target gene, and step number six is what the heck does that gene do? You basically now go and manipulate that gene to basically see what are the processes that change, and you can basically ask, well, in this particular case, in the FTO locus, we found mesenchymal stem cells that are the progenitors of white fat and brown fat or beige fat. We found the RS1421085 nucleotide variant as the causal variant. We found this large enhancer, this master regulator. I like to call it OB1 for obesity one, like the strongest enhancer associated with it, and OB1 was kind of chubby as the actor. I don't know if you remember him. So you basically are using this Jedi mind trick to basically find out the location of the genome that is responsible, the enhancer that harbors it, the motif, the upstream regulator, which is ARID5B for AT rich interacting domain 5B. That's a protein 
ther interesting direction is learning for virtual creatures, learning to walk. We did a study in simulation, obviously, that you create those creatures, not just their controller, but also their body. So you have cylinders, you have muscles, you have joints and sensors, and you're creating creatures that look quite different. Some of them have multiple legs. Some of them have no legs at all. And then the goal was to get them to move, to walk, to run. And what was interesting is that when you evolve the controller together with the body, you get movements that look natural because they're optimized for that physical setup. And these creatures, you start believing them that they're alive because they walk in a way that you would expect somebody with that kind of a setup to walk. Yeah, there's something subjective also about that, right? I've been thinking a lot about that, especially in the human robot interaction context. You know, I mentioned Spot, the Boston Dynamics robot. There is something about human robot communication. Let's say, let's p
thing you kind of experience, maybe the experience is a bit more complicated, but it's in this idea you have, this is a version of you. And the reason why I maintain the schedule I do is I've chosen a game to say, I would like to live a life where I care more about what intelligent, what people who live in the year 2500 think of me than I do today. That's the game I'm trying to play. And so therefore the only thing I really care about on this optimization is trying to see past myself, past my limitations, using zeroes principle thinking, pull myself out of this contextual mesh we're in right now and say, what will matter 100 years from now and 200 years from now? What are the big things really going on that are defining reality? And I find that if I were to hang out with Diet Soda Lex and Diet Soda Brian were to play along with that and my deep sleep were to get crushed as a result, my mind would not be on what matters in 100 years or 200 years or 300 years. I would be irritable. I would be, I'd be in a different state. And so it's just gameplay selecti
tions of overfitting and all those kinds of things? That's the logical space that the debugging is happening in with neural networks. Yeah, often the question is, why doesn't it work yet? Or can I expect it to eventually work? And what are the things I could try? Change the architecture, more data, more regularization, different optimization algorithm, different types of data. So to answer those questions systematically, so that you don't spend six months hitting down the blind alley before someone comes and says, why did you spend six months doing this? What concepts in deep learning do you think students struggle the most with? Or sort of is the biggest challenge for them was to get over that hill. It hooks them and it inspires them and they really get it. Similar to learning mathematics, I think one of the challenges of deep learning is that there are a lot of concepts that build on top of each other. If you ask me what's hard about mathematics, I have a hard time pinpointing one thing. Is it addition, subtraction? Is it a carry? Is i
 to cling to something. Like, we all want to feel accepted and belong to something. So all of a sudden you group up with these people and you all believe this fervently. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, they did it. They took it down. They took it down. And now you start going, yeah. And I think what happens is when you're in company of people and you start telling each other the same thing often, you freaking believe it. I mean, if you keep telling me I got a gray head of hair, I'm going to go, you know what? I do. But no, I don't. I mean, right? I got that waving bye bye do. But like, but you know, I think when you start hearing something often, you start believing it. But I'm not going to, I'm not going to doubt their intelligence. I'm not going to doubt their intentions, but I just don't see it as being plausible. I just, I, it would be too, too big of an operation to successfully happen. I, you know, I mean, look, there's other things that, you know, I won't say it on the interview there, but like I have my doubts with certain things, you know, that, that. I m
ral cups of coffee right before bed and just knock out anyway. I'm not sure if it's a biological chemical or it has to do with just the fact that I'm consuming huge amounts of caffeine. All that to say, what do you think is the relationship between coffee and sleep, caffeine and sleep? If there's an interesting distinction there. There is a distinction. So I think the first thing to say, which is going to sound strange coming from me is drink coffee. The health benefits associated with drinking coffee are really quite well established now. But I think that the counterpoint to that, well, firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison. And I'll perhaps come back to that in just a second. But for coffee, it's actually not the caffeine. So, a lot of people have asked me about this rightful paradox between the fact that sleep provides all of these incredible health benefits and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact on your sleep has a whole collection of health benefits. Many of them Venn diagram overlapping with those that s
ess, right? You shouldn't go into political office as an alleged lunchbox kind of guy and then come out eating at the best steakhouse in the world. I mean, that's the problem with politics, right? My Irish grandmother, God rest her, used to say, oh, those politicians, they're all like dirty diapers. They're full of shit and they stink. And it's true. I don't give a crap what party they're in. Yeah, greed and power. We had to beg these guys, beg them for federal legislation to cover our medical bills, right? There's a gentleman, John Field from the Feel Good Foundation. This guy is a lion of a man, a general, but with a soft, big, great heart. And John is a former construction worker who came to the 9.11 site the day after. He was one of those guys cutting the steel with torches and craning it out of the air. One of those hard hats that just, that never got the credit and the praise that we did as responders. And I don't mean that as a knock to responders, right? I mean, we lost 37 Port Authority police officers, 23 NYPD officers, about a dozen emergency medical
 Campbell, there's a thread that connects all of these stories, narratives that we constructed for ourselves as we evolve. And that thread is grounded in some kind of absolute ideas of maybe on the morality side, which is the trickiest one of good and evil. Somewhat, yeah, I think that a lot of this stuff is just derived from a biological perspective. I feel like these things are innate within us. Do you think our innately humans are good? No, I don't. I feel like, I also feel like there's the issue of scale too. Like Nassim Taleb likes to talk about how he views his, the way he interacts with groups in terms of scale. What is this thing about like at the familial level, I'm a communist and then at the civic level, I'm a Republican or something. And at this other level, and then it goes on at the widest level, he's a libertarian or something of that nature. Like fundamentally human interaction changes. On scale. On scale. And scale and also from subjective to the environment around them. So, and I don't even mean environment just in the sake 
liar. But for that reason, it's the most radical because you have to rethink all these things you know and they're way better in Hermosillo. Hardly any tourists go there. Like there's nothing to see in Hermosillo. Nothing you do other than eat. It's not ruined by any outsiders. It's this longstanding tradition, dirt cheap. And the thing to do there is just sweet talk a taxi driver into first taking you seriously and then trusting you enough to know that you trust him to bring you to the very best like food stands. So where's the magic of that nominally similar entity of the burrito? Where's the magic come from? Is it the taxi ride? Is it the whole experience or is there something actually in the food? So well, you can break the food down part by part. So if you think of the beef, the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air in a way the FDA here would never permit. Like they dry age it till it turns green, but it is phenomenal. The quality of the chilies. So here there's only a small number of kinds of chilies you can get. In most 
used to send my grandma in Ireland a letter. I adored her. She passed when I was 10. And, no, I'm sorry, I was 11. And I sent her a letter, airmailed, and I'd wait and I'd wait, and about two weeks later, this airmail letter would come back and she'd call me Master Nils William Jorgensen. I would be so excited, open that bad letter. Handwritten, just like. Yeah, and like, and then I'd write her another one and I just couldn't wait for letters from granny. And now it's like, you know, that's kind of faded away. Yeah, I still write letters, by the way, handwritten. I do too. The way this all came about was I wrote a letter to someone to say thank you for cancer research. I'm blessed to be alive. My cancer, right? That's a good starting point for any story. I'm blessed to be alive. And my cancer was one that if I got it 15 years prior to 19, excuse me, 2011, I was a dead man, right? 15, 20 years before there was no drug to treat. I was gone, going home to see him. So there's this wonderful gentleman that donated hundreds of millions of dollars to cancer research, Mr. David Koch. He's 
ns, I previously didn't have a good story for why they should learn to code. We could give them some reasons. But what I found with the rise of machine learning and data science is that I think the number of people with a concrete use for data science in their daily lives, in their jobs, may be even larger than the number of people who have concrete use for software engineering. For example, if you run a small mom and pop store, I think if you can analyze the data about your sales, your customers, I think there's actually real value there, maybe even more than traditional software engineering. So I find that for a lot of my friends in various professions, be it recruiters or accountants or people that work in the factories, which I deal with more and more these days, I feel if they were data scientists at some level, they could immediately use that in their work. So I think that data science and machine learning may be an even easier entree into the developer world for a lot of people than the software engineering. That's interes
rall you and excite you and stimulate you. But because of the insufficient sleep that they can or that goal can produce, it will shave off the beauty of life that you experience in between. And again, this is just about the trade off. I will say though that, and this is not applicable to your circumstance, we do know that insufficient sleep is very strongly linked to suicide ideation, suicide attempts and tragically suicide completion as well. And in fact, in 20 years of studying sleep, we have not been able to discover a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal. And I think that that is a profound, I think it tells us so much about the role of sleep as a potential causal agent in psychiatric conditions. I also think it's a potential sign that we should be using sleep as a tool for the prevention of grave mental illness. Yeah, it's both a cause and a solution. So yeah, I mean, me personally, I've gone through a few dark periods quite recently and it was almost always sleep is not the cause, but sleep is the catalyst from 
So maybe a quick pause. What is Occam's razor? So Occam's razor says that you should not multiply entities beyond necessity, which sort of, if you translate it to proper English means, and in the scientific context means that if you have two theories or hypothesis or models, which equally well describe the phenomenon, your study or the data, you should choose the more simple one. So that's just the principle or sort of, that's not like a provable law, perhaps. Perhaps we'll kind of discuss it and think about it, but what's the intuition of why the simpler answer is the one that is likely to be more correct descriptor of whatever we're talking about? I believe that Occam's razor is probably the most important principle in science. I mean, of course we lead logical deduction and we do experimental design, but science is about finding, understanding the world, finding models of the world. And we can come up with crazy complex models, which explain everything but predict nothing. But the simple model seem to have predictive power and it's a va
 too little, not too much, just the right amount. The second component is the timing though. Caffeine has half life of about five to six hours, meaning that after five to six hours, 50% of that on average for the average adult is still in the system, which means that it has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours. So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon, a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating in your brain at midnight. So having a cup of coffee at noon, one could argue is the equivalent of tucking yourself into bed at midnight, and before you turn the light out, you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee. But that doesn't still answer your question as to why are you so immune? So I'm someone who is actually unfortunately very sensitive to caffeine. And if I have even two cups of coffee in the morning, I don't sleep as well that night. And I find it miserable because I love the smell of coffee. I love the routine. I love the ritual. I think I would love to be invested in it. It's just terrible for my sleep. So I switched to decaf. There is 
et you to promote this shit coin for us? And being straightforward and forthright is a great productivity hack, because, you know, you just tell those people, no, I'm not interested. It's a stupid shit coin. And I wish you quick and swift failure before you take a lot of people's money. And that's what I genuinely think. Well, but I'll just be upfront with the fact, at least for my taste, just labeling everything as a shit coin worries me. So this is my own preference. It's not a judgment on you. It's just my own preference that I'm afraid I'll miss good ideas. I think when you're, me personally, when I'm too certain about things, when I'm too tribal about things, I'll miss actually really strong ideas, outlier ideas, totally new ideas. So that worries me. One of the downsides of the way Bitcoin is, how much shit is at stake financially is that it's less open to good, and actually by design, that it's not changing, like with the hard forks and so on, that there's not a kind of curiosity about exploration of ideas. Of course, in some way, that curiosity can 
her things that are not so compressible. I strongly believe and I'm pretty convinced that the universe is inherently beautiful, elegant and simple and described by these equations. And we're not just picking that. I mean, if there were some phenomena which cannot be neatly described, scientists would try that. And there's biology, which is more messy, but we understand that it's an emergent phenomena and it's complex systems, but they still follow the same rules of quantum and electrodynamics. All of chemistry follows that and we know that. I mean, we cannot compute everything because we have limited computational resources. No, I think it's not a bias of the humans, but it's objectively simple. I mean, of course, you never know, maybe there's some corners very far out in the universe or super, super tiny below the nucleus of atoms or parallel universes which are not nice and simple, but there's no evidence for that. And we should apply Occam's razor and choose the simplest three consistent with it. But also it's a little bit self referential. 
y from teaching to research to entrepreneurship two questions one are there regrets moments that if you went back you would do differently and two are there moments you're especially proud of moments that made you truly happy you know I've made so many mistakes it feels like every time I discover something I go why didn't I think of this you know five years earlier or even 10 years earlier and as recently and then sometimes I read a book and I go I wish I read this book 10 years ago my life would have been so different although that happened recently and then I was thinking if only I read this book when we're starting up Coursera I could have been so much better but I discovered the book had not yet been written we're starting Coursera so that made me feel better so that made me feel better but I find that the process of discovery we keep on finding out things that seem so obvious in hindsight but it always takes us so much longer than than I wish to to figure it out so on the second question are there moments in your
 do the same thing over and over again and in our brains also, you know, we came out, we start from single cells and they reproduce and each one does basically roughly the same thing. The program evolves in time, of course, different modules get turned on and off, different regions of the genetic code get turned on and off but basically, a lot of the same things are going on and they're simple things and so you produce the same patterns over and over again and that's a recipe for producing symmetry because you're getting the same thing in many, many places and if you look at, for instance, the beautiful drawings of Roman Icahal, the great neuroanatomist who drew the structure of different organs like the hippocampus, you see it's very regular and very intricate and it's symmetry in that sense because it's many repeated units that you can take from one place to the other and see that they look more or less the same. But what you're describing, this kind of beauty that we're talking about now is a very small sample in terms of space 
e people in their time of hardship. Well, you have some people serving in congressional districts don't even live in that district. I mean, so how are they gonna empathize? They're not even driving through there on a daily basis. And again, when anything becomes lucrative from a financial standpoint, it blurs people's vision. You have to take the potential of becoming rich out of politics. Politics is public service. Police and fire and EMS are public service, but cops and firemen and medics don't walk out of their career with gazillion dollar contracts with this company and that company on that board of directors and this board of directors. They walk out with a pension and that's it. And you have to wonder the intentions of people getting into politics. Are they truly going into to help the human condition or are they trying to help their own damn condition with their wallet and their pocketbook? And I try to lean toward the latter lately with what I'm seeing out there. Well, some of them are the good ones and that's our job as a s
 two minutes to lose it. And there is nothing more that I value than that integrity and, you know, if I'm ever wrong about anything, I truly don't want to be wrong for any longer than I have to be. You know, that's what being in some ways a scientist is. You're just driven by truth. And the irony relative to something like mathematics is that in science, you never find truth. What you do in science is you discount the things that are likely to be untrue, leaving only the possibility of what could be true. But in math, you know, when you create, you know, a proof, it's a proof for, you know, from that point forward, there is truth in mathematics. And there's, I think there's a beauty in that, but I kind of like the messiness of science because again, to me, it's less about the truth of the answer and it is more about the pursuit of questions. But their integrity becomes more and more important and it becomes more difficult. There's a lot of pressures, just like in the rest of the world, but there's a lot of pressures than a scientist. One is like fu
 person is because the car dynamics are very well understood. So the... Easier than first person, you mean? Or easier than... So I think the distinction between third person and first person is not a very important distinction for autonomous driving. They're very similar. Because the distinction is really about who turns the steering wheel. Or maybe, let me put it differently. How to get from a point where you are now to a point, let's say, a couple meters in front of you. And that's a problem that's very well understood. And that's the only distinction between third and first person there. Whereas with the robot manipulation, interaction forces are very complex. And it's still a very different thing. For autonomous driving, I think there is still the question, imitation versus RL. So imitation gives you a lot more signal. I think where imitation is lacking and needs some extra machinery is, it doesn't, in its normal format, doesn't think about goals or objectives. And of course, there are versions of imitation learning and versus reinforcement le
 of like gonna make the cell fire, but never enough to make the cell fire. It's sort of what we call, it says we depolarize the cell, you raise the voltage a little bit, but not enough to do anything. It's like, well, what good is that? And then it goes back down again. So we propose a theory, which I'm very confident in basics are, is that what's happening there is those 95% of the synapses are recognizing dozens to hundreds of unique patterns. They can write about 10, 20 synapses at a time, and they're acting like predictions. So the neuron actually is a predictive engine on its own. It can fire when it gets enough, what they call proximal input from those ones near the cell fire, but it can get ready to fire from dozens to hundreds of patterns that it recognizes from the other guys. And the advantage of this to the neuron is that when it actually does produce a spike in action potential, it does so slightly sooner than it would have otherwise. And so what could is slightly sooner? Well, the slightly sooner part is it, all the excitatory neuro
ut I have a sense that there's a deep loneliness within all of us. Absolutely. In the face of death, it feels like we're alone. So, you know, the, what drew me to the existential take on things, Lex, was the, who is it, Rollo May and Erwin Yallem write about existentialism and they're like, look, what, there's different flavors of existentialism, but they all have in common, what is it, four universal concerns. The overriding one is about death. And that next is choice and responsibility. The next one is existential isolation. And they're like, that's one of the things about consciousness that, and the last one is meaninglessness, but the existential isolation point is, you know, we are by virtue of consciousness able to apprehend that unless you're a Siamese twin, you are fundamentally alone. And because it is claimed, it's Eric Fromm in a book called Escape from Freedom. He's like, look, you're smart enough to know that the most direct way that we typically communicate with our fellow human beings is through language. But you also know that language
illion loan to buy a house, that bank is not gonna give you a million dollars from their own money or from their depositor's money. They're gonna make a fresh new million dollars. When you walk out of that bank, the money supply has increased by $1 million to finance your home. So what fiat does is, I mean, it was basically born out of government credit and the credit of banks that are backed by the central bank and the government. So if you're part of the institutions that are allowed fiat privilege, where you can just issue loans backed by the central bank, backed by the currency, you are effectively creating new currency, new money every time you issue the loan. That's fiat mining is credit creation, I love it. So can you say something, I mean, you can't really have credit without a demand for credit. You can't really have an increase in supply without a demand for it. Is there any value you place in the humans wanting it? Basically, people wanting to do something with that credit, wanting to take big leaps, big risks, big entrepreneuria
 that gene. And then the fourth one is perturbations where I can go in and blow up that region and see what are the genes that change in expression, or I can go in and over activate that region and see what genes change in expression. So I guess that's similar to activity? Yeah. Yeah. So that's basically similar to activity. I agree, but it's causal rather than correlational. Again, I'm a little weird. No, no, you're 100% on. It's exactly the same as the perturbation where I go in and intervene. I basically take a bunch of cells. So you know CRISPR, right? CRISPR is this genome guidance and cutting mechanism. That's what George Church likes to call genome vandalism. So you basically are able to, you can basically take a guide RNA that you put into the CRISPR system, and the CRISPR system will basically use this guide RNA, scan the genome, find wherever there's a match, and then cut the genome. So I digress, but it's a bacterial immune defense system. So basically bacteria are constantly attacked by viruses, but sometimes they win against the viruses 
eafter. So there are some people. So it's David Sloan Wilson wrote a book called Darwin's Cathedral. And he said, religion has nothing to do with death. It's evolved to make groups viable. He's actually a group selection guy. What's group selection? The idea that it's the group that is selected for rather than the individual. Yeah, so people have vigorous disagreements about that. But I guess our point would be, we see religion as being inextricably connected, ultimately, to assuaging concerns about death. Well, I guess another question to ask around this, like, what does the world look like without religion? Will we, if it's inextricably connected to our fears of death, do you think it always returns in some kind of shape? Maybe it's not called religion, but whatever, it just keeps returning? Yeah, who knows? So that's a great question, Lex. So there's a woman named Karen Armstrong. She was a nun turned historian. And she's, I can't remember the name of the book, but no matter. She, we could look that up, but... If you want, I can look it up, but I can also, I'l
 understand why it happened exactly in the way it did. Or there are certainly open questions about the origins of life and how inevitable the emergence of intelligence was and how that happened. But in the very broadest terms, the universe early on was quite homogeneous, but not completely homogeneous. There were part in 10,000 fluctuations in density within this primordial plasma. And as time goes on, there's an instability which causes those density contrasts to increase. There's a gravitational instability where it's denser, the gravitational attractions are stronger. And so that brings in more matter and it gets even denser and so on and so on. So there's a natural tendency of matter to clump because of gravitational interactions. And then the equation is complicated. We have lots of things clumping together. Then we know what the laws are, but we have to a certain extent wave our hands about what happens. But basic understanding of chemistry says that if things and the physics of radiation tells us that as things start to clump t
t even this going in there with the aspect of being with death and all that is that when that person is in there, they are my brother with me in this. And so when you give me your best, even if I win dominant fashion, but if you show up and you're as authentic and being here as I am, then I love you. And I'm glad for you to be here. And we're in this together. And at this point, your loss or my loss or whatever is no less deserving of veneration than the win. Like we're here in this. And so to be in the ring with Führer and to venerate him in win or defeat, to be in there with someone like that is, to me, it's so rare, so. It's incredible how the ultimate violence is coupled with love or respect. And it's weird how the competition in its violent form is also a veneration of just human connection. Human connection. It's also the removal. I feel like it's the purest, one of the purest ways, purest, most honest places a person can exist. That line in Fight Club, you don't know really who you are until you've been in a fight. I mean, I believe that. An
s antagonistic concept. And while sure, tribalism can be antagonistic, tribalism can also be a positive thing, or I could just say, it just seems to be a natural thing. People, they create their groups of one sort or another. And so when you have, well, when you think about when nation states really started to become a thing, and I don't mean even the more modern looking variants that we could think back up and say the 19th century or something like that, even older than that. I mean, you think the Assyrians didn't have a state of some sort? Of course they did. How do you increase your empire if you don't actually have a place to start from? Just to be a ruler. So you're saying like naturally, when you start talking and thinking about scale of humans, naturally states emerge. And so can we try to make an argument for anarchism, which is, so anarchy in a sense is an opposition to the unhelpful, unproductive, inefficient bureaucracies that eventually the states lead to. Yes, and that's what we can see. I mean, I would say less anarchy, more study 
them. Yeah, there were these big, sexy phones. And they didn't work very well. They did almost nothing. So you can only afford these things if you're wealthy at a point where they really don't work very well. So achieving scale and making it inexpensive is part of making the thing work well. Exactly. So these are not totally cheap, but they're pretty cheap. I mean, you can get them for a few hundred dollars. Especially given the kind of things it provides for you. There's a lot of people in the third world that have very little, but they have a smartphone. Yeah, absolutely. And the same will be true with AI. I mean, I see homeless people have their own cell phones. Yeah, so your sense is any kind of advanced technology will take the same trajectory. Right, it ultimately becomes cheap and will be affordable. I probably would not be the first person to put something in my brain to connect to computers because I think it will have limitations. But once it's really perfected, and at that point it'll be pretty inexpensive, I think it'll be pretty af
w those fundamentals you get into points and some of those are actually interesting and useful. Now, even in that robotic Walker simulation there was a large set of garbage, but among them, there were some of these gems. And then those are the ones that somehow you have to outside recognize and make useful. But this kind of productive systems if you code them the right kind of principles I think that encode the structure of the domain then you will get to these solutions and discoveries. It feels like that might also be a good way to live life. So let me ask, do you have advice for young people today about how to live life or how to succeed in their career or forget career, just succeed in life from an evolution and computation perspective? Yes, yes, definitely. Explore, diversity, exploration and individuals take classes in music, history, philosophy, math, engineering, see connections between them, travel, learn a language. I mean, all this diversity is fascinating and we have it at our fingertips today. It's possible, you have to mak
ing you care about, trying to solve problems in that thing. And that's your small group and you really like them and they like you and you care what you think about each other and you have this common interest. That's for human connection or that's for development of ideas? It's both, they're not that different. than say Germany or Denmark. But there is truly, whether from the government or from your private community, there is less social security in some fundamental sense. On the point of weirdo, what, that's kind of a beautiful little statement. What is that? I mean, that seems to be, you know, you could think of a guy like Elon Musk and say that he's a weirdo. Is that the sense in which you're using weirdo like outside of the norm, like breaking conventions? Absolutely. And here that is either acceptable or even admired or to be a loner. And since so many people are outsiders and that we're all immigrants is selecting for people who left something behind, we're willing to leave behind their families, we're willing to undergo a certain brut
ensing, meaning driver facing camera that tracks some kind of information about the face that can tell you drowsiness. So you can tell the car if you're drowsy so that the car can be like, you should be probably driving or pull to the side. Right, or I need to do some of the heavy lifting here. Yeah, so there needs to be that dance of interaction of a human and machine, but currently it's mostly steering wheel based. So this idea that your hands should be on the steering wheel, that's a sign that you're paying attention is an outdated and a very crude metric. I agree, yeah. I think there are far more sophisticated ways that we can solve that problem if we invest. Can I ask you a big philosophical question before we get into fun details? On the topic of conscious states, how fundamental do you think is consciousness to the human mind? I ask this from almost like a robotics perspective. So in your study of sleep, do you think the hard question of consciousness that it feels like something to be us, is that like a nice little feature, l
ok, before the pandemic, the two most robot intensive societies, Japan and the US, US at least for manufacturing, were at full employment. So maybe there's some far off day where there's literally no work, John Lennon, and imagine it's piped everywhere. And then we might revisit the question. But for now, we had rising wages in the Trump years and full employment. So I don't see the point. You don't see automation as a threat that fundamentally shakes our society. It's a threat in the following sense. The new technologies are harder to work with for many people, and that's a social problem. But I'm not sure a universal basic income is the right answer to that very real problem. Well, that's also, I like the UBI for kids. It's also your definition or the line, the threshold for what is vulnerable and what is basic human nature. Going back to Russia, life is suffering. That struggle is a part of life. And perhaps sort of changing, maybe what defines the 21st century is having multiple careers and adjusting and learning and evolving. And some of the t
king about it since he was five years old and it was an inevitability. But the idea that kind of got hatched in 1999 was to just do some advanced scouting work, explore the corners of the space of possibilities. And so that was Blue Operations LLC, which was the precursor to Blue Origin. And so it was a small staff of people that did that for a few years. And I think it was about 2003, 2004 that it swung decisively towards the direction it's been following ever since, which is using basically existing aerospace technologies and models to make chemical fueled rockets for space tourism. I believe and I continue to believe that the fact that we use chemical rockets is just an accident of history that comes out of World War II. So until World War II, rockets are being built on a small scale by people like Robert Goddard. But then Hitler desperately wants to bomb London, but he can't quite reach it and the Luftwaffe has been kind of neutralized. So he decides he's going to lob warheads into it with rockets, which is a terrible misallocation of
not having powerful enough instruments yet to do this. Do you have a preference? I keep seeing this E. Lisa idea. Yeah. Is it, do you have a preference for earthbound or space faring mechanisms for? They're complimentary. It's a little bit like, it's completely analogous to what's been done in astronomy. So astronomy from the time of Galileo was done with visible light. The big advances in astronomy in the last 50 years are because we have instruments that look at the infrared, microwave, ultraviolet and so forth. So looking at different wavelengths has been important. Basically going into space means that we'll look at instead of the audio band, which we look at, as we said on the Earth's surface, we'll look at lower frequencies. So it's completely complimentary and it starts to be looking at different frequencies just like we do with astronomy. It seems almost incredible to me, engineering wise, just like on earth to send something that's kilometers across into space. Is that harder to engineer? It actually is a little different. It's three sa
y if you don't prune your synapses the right way, you will actually have an increased role of schizophrenia. This is something that was completely unexpected for schizophrenia. Of course, we knew it has to do with neurons, but the role of the complement complex, which is also implicated in AMD, which is now also implicated in schizophrenia, was a huge surprise. What's the complement complex? So it's basically a set of genes, the complement genes that are basically having various immune roles. And as I was saying earlier, our immune system has been coopted for many different roles across the body. So they actually play many diverse roles. And somehow the immune system is connected to the synaptic pruning process, the process. Exactly. So the prune cells were coopted to prune synapses. How did you figure this out? How does one go about figuring this intricate connection, like pipeline of connections out? Yeah. Let me give you another example. So Alzheimer's disease, the first place that you would expect it to act is obviously the brain. So 
d before that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep or prolonged sleep deprivation is under conditions of starvation. And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure. And at that point, the brain will forgo some. It won't forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep. And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain, you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter, you need to stay awake for longer so you can travel outside of your perimeter for a further distance and maybe you will find food and save the organism. So in other words, when we fast, it's giving our brain this evolutionary signal that you are under conditions of starvation. So the brain responds by saying, oh my goodness, I need to release the chemical that helps the organism stay awake for longer which is orexin. So that they can forage for more food. Now, of course, your brain from an evolutionary perspective doesn't know about this thing called Safeway that you could easily go to and break the 
at's happening today. He wrote a book about globalism. And actually Hannah Arendt in the 1950s said the same thing in her book about totalitarianism. When she said that, you know, that economics has reached the point where most money is made, not by actually making stuff, you know, you use money to make money. And therefore, what happens is money chases money across national boundaries. Ultimately, governments become subordinate to the corporate entities whose sole function is to generate money. And what John Gray said is that that will inevitably produce economic upheaval in local areas, which will not be attributed to the economic order. It will be misattributed to whoever the scapegoat du jour is, and the anger and the distress associated with that uncertainty will be picked up on by ideological demagogues who will transform that into rage. So both Hannah Arendt as well as John Gray, they just said, watch out, we're gonna have right wingish populist movements where demagogues who are the alchemists of hate, what makes them brilliant
aZero and AlphaStar that are kind of exploring how you can solve it through in the simulation in the gaming world? Is there stuff in sort of all the transformer work and natural English processing, sort of maybe attacking the open domain dialogue? Like what, where do you see a promising pathways? Let me pick the embodiment maybe. So embodiment is important, yes and no. I don't believe that we need a physical robot walking or rolling around, interacting with the real world in order to achieve AGI. And I think it's more of a distraction probably than helpful, it's sort of confusing the body with the mind. For industrial applications or near term applications, of course we need robots for all kinds of things, but for solving the big problem, at least at this stage, I think it's not necessary. But the answer is also yes, that I think the most promising approach is that you have an agent and that can be a virtual agent in a computer interacting with an environment, possibly a 3D simulated environment like in many computer games. And you t
an stop asking my conscious mind for its advice or for its decision making, which is flawed. And I'd rather just look at this data and I've never had better health markers in my life than when I stopped actually asking myself to be in charge of it. The idea of demotion of the conscious mind is such a sort of engineering way of phrasing meditation. That's what we're doing, right? That's beautiful, that means really beautifully put. By the way, testing round, what does that look like? What's that? Well, you mentioned. Yeah, the test I do. Yes. So it includes a complete blood panel. I do a microbiome test. I do a diet induced inflammation. So I look for exotokine expressions. So foods that produce inflammatory reactions. I look at my neuroendocrine systems. I look at all my neurotransmitters. I do, yeah, there's several micronutrient tests to see how I'm looking at the various nutrients. What about self report of how you feel? Almost like, you can't demote your, you still exist within your conscious mind, right? So that lived experience is of a lot of 
 value across time like gold, but much better than gold. But also it is similar to fiat in that fiat can travel quickly, but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat. So it combines gold's salability across time with fiat's salability across space in one immutable package that nobody can change and nobody can control. Can you define the word salability? Salability is the essential property of money. It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market, specifically to be sold without much loss in its value. So houses are great for living in, but they're not very salable. If you wanna sell a house, you can just click a button and sell a house and have a giant market of people buying houses from you. You need to find somebody who wants the exact house that you have with the exact specifications that you have. And because houses are not identical, there's no liquid giant market for people to just buy and sell identical houses from. So gold, for instance, has good salability as money because it's a liquid good, it's uniform, and peop
 that view, I think. But you know, people will find ways to be divisive and angry if it scratches a kind of psychological itch that they have got. And we used to look at the Weimar Republic, what happened in the economic collapse of Germany prior to the rise of Hitler, World War II, and kind of explain Hitler, at least partially by just the misery that people were living in at that time. The economic collapse. Yeah, hyperinflation and unemployment and the decline in standard of living. And that sounds like a plausible explanation. But there are economic troubles now for sure. We had the bank collapse in 2008. And there's stagnation in some people's standards of living. But it's hard to explain what we've seen in this country in the last few years just strictly on the basis of people are poor and angry and sad. I think they want to be angry. So without being political in a divisive kind of way, can we talk about the lessons you can draw from World War II? Sure. This singular event in human history, it seems like, and yet, as you say, history 
cember of this last year. The idea of how you can assign reference frames to reference frames, how neurons could do this. So, well, my question is, even though you mentioned reference frames a lot, I almost feel it's really useful to dig into how you think of what a reference frame is. I mean, it was already helpful for me to understand that you think of reference frames as something there is a lot of. Okay, so let's just say that we're gonna have some neurons in the brain, not many, actually, 10,000, 20,000 are gonna create a whole bunch of reference frames. What does it mean? What is a reference frame? First of all, these reference frames are different than the ones you might be used to. We know lots of reference frames. For example, we know the Cartesian coordinates, X, Y, Z, that's a type of reference frame. We know longitude and latitude, that's a different type of reference frame. If I look at a printed map, you might have columns A through M, and rows one through 20, that's a different type of reference frame. It's kind of a Cartesian coordinate reference
ernments were to go and peg their currencies to gold again, the price of gold would shoot up 5, 10x, and it would rise in value a lot more. Of course, that doesn't necessarily kill Bitcoin. No, again, I'm not saying it's likely to happen. I'm saying it's, I imagine, less likely, less unlikely than all the other unlikely scenarios. Because, you know, even with a nuclear war, like 90% of the planet is destroyed, the 10% continue to run Bitcoin. That's a quote. Okay, there's a movement, a community of people referred to as Bitcoin maximalists. I've seen you referred, at least in the past, as the leader of the Bitcoin maximalists, probably because of your book, Bitcoin Standard, consider the Bible in general. You're one of the leaders in this space. Do you regret any of the toxicity and derision that often or perhaps sometimes originates from this community? Definitely not. I'm not in the position to regret other people's actions, so let's just be clear. I think the rhetoric of community is, I reject this rhetoric because I think it's a way for kind of political manip
ult to be able to exchange a large number of goods. It's very difficult to have a sophisticated economy with a large degree of specialization, because it's very difficult to find people who want the thing that you have and have the thing that you want. We call this the coincidence of wants. And that's really the problem that money solves. So you make apples and I make oranges. I'd like to have some of your apples, but you don't want my oranges. And that's, we have a problem of coincidence of wants. So what do I do? You want bananas. I need to find somebody who has bananas, give them my oranges, take their bananas, give you their bananas, and then I take the apples. In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange. So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve and will emerge in an economy as an economy becomes more sophisticated. As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods, it's inevitable that we're going to come to a situation where we have the problem of coincidence of wants. And the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange. And i
ing of your little world that you're creating for yourself on the internet. That's a really powerful way to actually phrase it. One of the things that you've been on Joe Rogan several times. Although everybody always comes to me and go, oh, that was so great. I didn't know you, you're on, you've on Joe Rogan. I go, this is like my fifth time, dude. I've been a fan of yours for a long time from other avenues. This is a long time coming actually. Everybody, you have no idea. Like how many times through messaging and missing each other over the years. This is ridiculous. This is a long time coming. You don't realize how special this is for us. This is, well, I'm also starstruck. We'll talk about this, but you symbolize something very important to me through my journey, through wrestling, through Jiu Jitsu, through Judo, through just street fighting, through just combat. There's a, you're the, in some sense, the devil on my shoulder of like, of violence. In a good, in a, devil gets a bad rap. He does get a bad rap. I realize, you know, sitting encased in ice down a
ls, but it's not useful in the long term for creating intelligence. So you think you also have a role in proposing better tests? Yeah, this is a very, you've identified a very serious problem. First of all, the tests that they have are the tests that they want. Not the tests of the other things that we're trying to do, right? You know, what are the, so on. The second thing is sometimes these, to be competitive in these tests, you have to have huge data sets and huge computing power. And so, you know, and we don't have that here. We don't have it as well as other big teams that big companies do. So there's numerous issues there. You know, we come out, you know, where our approach to this is all based on, in some sense, you might argue, elegance. We're coming at it from like a theoretical base that we think, oh my God, this is so clearly elegant. This is how brains work. This is what intelligence is. But the machine learning world has gotten in this phase where they think it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter what you think, as long as you do, you know, 0.1% bette
senting something. The way the representations occur, it's always a sparse representation. Meaning it's a population code. So which 200 cells are active tells me what's going on. It's not, individual cells aren't that important at all. It's the population code that matters. And when you have sparse population codes, then all kinds of beautiful properties come out of them. So the brain uses sparse population codes. We've written and described these benefits in some of our papers. So they give this tremendous robustness to the systems. Brains are incredibly robust. Neurons are dying all the time and spasming and synapses are falling apart all the time. And it keeps working. So what Sibutai and Louise, one of our other engineers here have done, have shown they're introducing sparseness into convolutional neural networks. Now other people are thinking along these lines, but we're going about it in a more principled way, I think. And we're showing that if you enforce sparseness throughout these convolutional neural networks in both the act, which so
 spent 10 years on this problem before he of the South Pole Station. Well, in the computing world, there's an idea of backing up your data and then you want to do offsite backup, to make sure that if the whole thing burns, if your whole house burns down, that you can have a backup offsite of the data. I think the difference between Antarctica and Mars is Mars is an offsite backup. That if we have nuclear war, whatever the heck might happen here on earth, it'd be nice to have a backup elsewhere. And it'd be nice to have a large enough colony where we sent a variety of people except a few silly astronauts in suits, have an actual vibrant, get a few musicians and artists up there, get a few, maybe like one or two computer scientists, those are essential. Maybe even a physicist, but I'm not sure. Yeah, maybe not. So that comes back to something you talked about earlier, which is the paradox, Fermi's paradox, because you talked about having to escape. And so one number you don't know how to use in Fermi's calculation or Drake, who's done it better, i
t's all across the world, but the miners, they're still, it's more centralized. So if you're thinking of making a case for Bitcoin being decentralized, do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized? Is the nodes the important thing to think about? Yeah. And what number of nodes counts as centralized and not? The nodes are what matters because the nodes are what determines Bitcoin's consensus parameters. I think the best way to think about it is that miners simply sell a commodity to the nodes and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks. So what a miner does is they solve the proof of work problem so they keep operating their computers until they can get a solution to the problem. And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions and present it to the nodes for the nodes to ratify and approve it. So therefore, this is, and this is, I strongly recommend people learn about the 2017 block size war to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin. I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard, but there's a recent book that discusses t
uestion, maybe just asking the same thing in two different ways. One question is, do you have hope that humans will colonize the galaxy? So expand out, become a multi planetary species. Another way of asking that from a gravitational and a propulsion perspective, do you think we'll come up with ways to travel closer to the speed of light or maybe faster than the speed of light, which would make it a whole heck of a lot easier to expand out into the universe? Yeah. Well, I think that's very futuristic. I think we're not that far from being able to make a one way trip to Mars. That's then a question of whether people are willing to send somebody on a one way trip. Oh, I think they are. There's a lot of the explorers burned bright within our hearts. Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of people willing to die for the opportunity to explore new territory. So this recent landing on Mars is pretty impressive. They have a little helicopter. They're going to fly around. You can imagine in the not too distant future that you could have, I don't think civil
like making Hollywood movies. They just. No, we're getting better and better, but we're treating each other worse and worse. You would think with all this technology and all the knowledge and all the, it's like, what the hell is going on sometimes? Like, I really want to see the good. And I think maybe, maybe the level of bad that we're seeing was always existent. It's just now everything is instantaneous news and flashes and tweets and this and this. Like, like, you know. Well, with the technology we have, it's also come to the light. So you get to see all these fights. It almost, I think that's step one of dealing with the problem is revealing it in its full beautiful light. Oh yeah. How much of a bickering species we are. 50 years ago, a guy like me who loves to talk, how the hell would I have gotten an opportunity to have someone listen to me and have, right? I love this. This is amazing. It's cool. But like, but you didn't have that arena. You didn't have all these things. My grandfather, Nels, God rest him, he died in 1979. I mean, that dude didn't even want
billion dollars pledged. That's just unimaginable to me at the time when I was first kind of getting this, you know, getting the stuff off the ground. So can we talk about poverty and the biggest problems that you think in the near term effective altruism can attack in each one. So poverty obviously is a huge one. Yeah. How can we help? Great. Yeah. So poverty, absolutely this huge problem. 700 million people in extreme poverty living in less than two dollars per day where that's what that means is what two dollars would buy in the US. So think about that. It's like some rice, maybe some beans. It's very, you know, really not much. And at the same time, we can do an enormous amount to improve the lives of people in extreme poverty. So the things that we tend to focus on interventions in global health and that's for a couple of few reasons. One is like global health just has this amazing track record life expectancy globally is up 50% relative to 60 or 70 years ago. We've eradicated smallpox that's which killed 2 million lives every year almost eradi
 is one path by which you arrive at the conclusion that free markets are better because you realize that all of the people that think that they can centrally plan markets can't actually do that. And that there's really nothing scientific about them except essentially the rituals they ape of the scientific process. And the other path I think that makes you arrive at the Austrian perspective or the libertarian perspective I should say, is simply the notion of individuals as having their own inalienable right to decide what they want to do with themselves. If you, I mean, the only way that you can give yourself the idea that you get to be planner is ultimately you think you're better than other people. You think your choice, your judgment overrides mine. And I don't think that's a defensible position. I think I'm in no position to want to force anybody ever. I will never want to force anybody to do anything they don't want. The Keynesian perspective, the central planning perspective is unlike physics, which is let's force a bunch of 
re? Is there something interesting to you as an economist, as a human being, about Russia? Everything is interesting. I mean, here would be part of my take. As you know, the Russian economy starting, what, 1999, 2000, has really quite a few years of super excellent growth. And Putin is still riding on that. It more or less coincides with his rise as the truly focal figure on the scene. Since then, pretty recently, they've had a bunch of years of negative four to 5% growth in a row, which is terrible. The economy is way too dependent on fossil fuels, but the structural problem is this. You need a concordance across economic power, social power, political power. They don't have to be allocated identically, but they have to be allocated consistently. And the Russian system under Putin, from almost the beginning, has never been able to have that, that ultimately his incentives are to steer the system where the economic power is in a small number of hands in a non diversified way. The system won't deliver sustainable gains in living standards anymore ever 
hey teach you how to take care of stuff. How the hell in this country should any vet come back home and be homeless? Because now they have to dedicate their lives for six, seven, 10, 12 years, five, six deployments making $7.50 an hour. And then they spend seven years or they get a whopping $16 an hour. They walk out making 35 grand. And now no one gives them a job. No one gives them a chance. So very quickly they end up homeless by no fault of their own. And I don't know how that's even possible. The people in this country who've given the very most and they're struggling, they're hurting. That's not fair. And my whole thing is if I can have this dream of succeeding, so to speak, I want to try to change it. So that's why I'm praying to be a billionaire. My Irish mother probably wouldn't agree either because you're not supposed to, right? Well, I'm the same with you. The more money you have, the more you're able to help. Yeah, you can put smiles on people's faces. I have to ask you, the US invaded Afghanistan in October, 2001 in response to terror attacks. Now 20 years lat
bite on, whatever. I said, but you get that pain out, but you need to do this so you can get saved. And she said, okay. And they came in and they, this huge thick needle, they just bore it into you. And she's screaming for her life and she's squeezing my fingers so hard and so hard. And I said, that's okay, hon. You keep going, you keep going. We got it. It's just 10 more seconds, 10 more seconds. They got it. They figured out her treatment and they got her onto her road to recovery. And then I spent a long time asking God, why do I have cancer? Then I stopped and I went, wait a minute. I didn't die that day with my friends. Shame on me for asking them why I have cancer. I had 10 years after 9 11 with such great ears. And I got to watch my little girl being born when John never got to see his son. So it was all gravy after that. And I said, but now I know why I have my cancer because I can empathize with people who have it. And I can try to be their voice when they can't talk, be their shield to try to take that pain because I can understand, I can walk the
air. So, you know, we may be entering one of those interesting times, you know, in the Chinese curse sense, yeah. So I could be wrong, but I mean, there've been some efforts to explore solar geoengineering. There was a plan to send up some balloons, high altitude balloons to take some measurements in Scandinavia that got squashed by objections from people who lived up there who were just opposed to the whole program on principle. So we'll see a lot more of that. And it's going to be a hard program to advocate for just because I think people don't quite understand how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere and how far we are from even slowing down the rate that we're adding more to say nothing of bringing that number down. We're a long way out from that. Do you see in terms of portfolio of solutions, us becoming a multi planetary species as part of that? Is this also being a motivator for investing some percent of GDP into becoming a multi planetary species? And what percent should that be, you think? You know, in an indirect way, mayb
g, how wrong it is, and then try to correct for it as best I can. But I assume that on impact, it's mistaken in some critical ways. Is there something you can say by way of advice when the mind is depressive, when the conscious mind serves up something that, dark thoughts, how you deal with that, like how in your own life you've overcome that, and others who are experiencing that can overcome it? Two things. One, those depressive states are biochemical states. It's not you. And the suggestions that these things, that this state delivers to you about suggestion of the hopelessness of life or the meaninglessness of it, or that you should hit the eject button, that's a false reality. And that it's when, I completely understand the rational decision to commit suicide. It is not lost on me at all that that is an irrational situation, but the key is when you're in that situation and those thoughts are landing, to be able to say, thank you, you're not real. I know you're not real. And so I'm in a situation where for whatever reason I'm having this neur
l world. So people would have to hand design some kind of logical, dynamical descriptions of the world and that didn't tie into perception. And so it didn't tie into real objects and so forth. And so that was a big gap. Now with deep learning, we start having the ability to really see with sensors, process that and understand what's in the world. And so it's a good time to try to bring these things together. I see a few ways of getting there. One way to get there would be to say deep learning can get bolted on somehow to some of these more traditional approaches. Now bolted on would probably mean you need to do some kind of end to end training where you say my deep learning processing somehow leads to a representation that in term uses some kind of traditional underlying dynamical systems that can be used for planning. And that's, for example, the direction Aviv Tamar and Thanard Kuretach here have been pushing with causal info again and of course other people too. That's one way. Can we somehow force it into the form factor that 
ak the language, had a sponsor family in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. And he made it, you know, he ended up dying owning a bakery at one point and then an apartment building. And he did pretty well for himself for an immigrant who was poor. And my mom, my Irish mother landed in the same neighborhood, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 16 years old. Worked as a cashier 50, 60 hours a week in the supermarket and finished school at night. Married my father, the fireman, and, you know, lived the American dream. And it was all, it was all from New York. And my father's mom was from Irish immigrants and they all landed in Ellis Island. Well, my mom didn't cause it was closed at that point, but it's, there's people breaking down the doors to come to this country, right? There's no one breaking down the doors to leave. And this is, this is a problem I have with people that aren't grateful for being here. And this, again, it's not political, just straight down the middle fastball. If you don't like it here, I'll show you the door. I'll get you the plane ticket. I mean, would you want to live 
 is that if you do feedback control, even though the system you control can be very, very complex, often relatively simple control architectures can already do a lot. But then also just linear is not good enough. And so one way you can think of these neural networks is that sometimes they tile the space, which people were already trying to do more by hand or with finite state machines, say this linear controller here, this linear controller here. Neural network learns to tile the space and say linear controller here, another linear controller here, but it's more subtle than that. And so it's benefiting from this linear control aspect, it's benefiting from the tiling, but it's somehow tiling it one dimension at a time. Because if let's say you have a two layer network, if in that hidden layer, you make a transition from active to inactive or the other way around, that is essentially one axis, but not axis aligned, but one direction that you change. And so you have this kind of very gradual tiling of the space where you have a lot of sh
rules before. And we've seen society change over time quite a bit along those lines. That there were rules in society that we don't believe are fair anymore, even though they were considered proper behavior before. So things are changing. And I think that in that sense, I think it's a good idea to be able to tolerate some of that cheating because eventually we might turn into something better. So yeah, I think this is a message to the trolls and the assholes of the internet that you too have a beautiful purpose in this human ecosystem. So I appreciate you very much. In moderate quantities, yeah. In moderate quantities. So there's a whole field of artificial life. I don't know if you're connected to this field, if you pay attention. Is, do you think about this kind of thing? Is there impressive demonstration to you of artificial life? Do you think of the agency you work with in the evolutionary computation perspective as life? And where do you think this is headed? Like, is there interesting systems that we'll be creating more and more th
m $1,000 a year to $2,000 a year has the same impact as someone moving from $100,000 a year to $200,000 a year. And then when you combine that with the fact that we in middle class members of rich countries are 100 times richer than financial terms in the global poor, that means we can do a hundred times to benefit the poorest people in the world as we can to benefit people of our income level. And that's this astonishing fact. Yeah, it's quite incredible. A lot of these facts and ideas are just difficult to think about because there's an overwhelming amount of suffering in the world. And even acknowledging it is difficult. Not exactly sure why that is. I mean, I mean, it's difficult because you have to bring to mind, you know, it's an unpleasant experience thinking about other people's suffering. It's unpleasant to be empathizing with it, firstly. And then secondly, thinking about it means that maybe we'd have to change our lifestyles. And if you're very attached to the income that you've got, perhaps you don't want to be confronting ideas or arguments that might caus
constraints favor first principle thinking because it enables faster action with higher probability of success. Pursuing zero with principle optionality is expensive and uncertain. And so in a society constrained by resources, time and money and a desire for social status, accomplishment, et cetera, it minimizes zero with principle thinking. But the reason why I think zero with principle thinking should be a staple of our shared cognitive infrastructure is if you look through the history of the past couple of thousand years and let's just say we arbitrarily, we subjectively try to assess what is a zero level idea. And we say how many have occurred on what time scales and what were the contextual settings for it? I would argue that if you look at AlphaGo, when it played Go from another dimension, with the human Go players, when it saw AlphaGo's moves, it attributed to like playing with an alien, playing Go with AlphaGo being from another dimension. And so if you say computational intelligence has an attribute of introducing zer
ochemical state, but that state can be altered. And so again, it goes back to the realities of the difficulties of being human. And like when I was trying to solve my depression, I tried literally, you name it, I tried it systematically, and nothing would fix it. And so this is what gives me hope with brain interfaces, for example, like, could I have numbers on my brain? Can I see what's going on? Because I go to the doctor and it's like, how do you feel? I don't know, terrible. Like on a scale from one to 10, how bad do you want to commit suicide? 10. Okay, here's his bottle. How much should I take? Well, I don't know, like just. Yeah, it's very, very crude. And this data opens up the, yeah, it opens up the possibility of really helping in those dark moments to first understand the ways, the ups and downs of those dark moments. On the complete flip side of that, right, I am very conscious in my own brain and deeply, deeply grateful that what there, it's almost like a chemistry thing, a biochemistry thing that I go many times throughout the day. I'll look at l
 want to extract energy, this motion is not something you can extract energy from. If you intervene in the behavior, you can change it, but only by injecting energy, not by taking away energy. You mentioned that a theory of everything may be quite difficult to come by. A theory of everything broadly defined meaning like truly a theory of everything, but let's look at a more narrow theory of everything, which is the way it's used often in physics is a theory that unifies our current laws of physics, general relativity, quantum field theory. Do you have thoughts on this dream of a theory of everything in physics? How close are we? Is there any promising ideas out there in your view? Well, it would be nice to have. It would be aesthetically pleasing. Will it be useful? No, probably not. Well, I shouldn't, it's dangerous to say that, but probably not. I think we, certainly not in the foreseeable future. Maybe to understand black holes. Yeah, but that's, yes, maybe to understand black holes, but that's not useful. That's my book. And well, not only, I mean
lly, you know, these vast energetic needs over a lifetime of thinking can basically lead to all of these debris and eventually saturate the system and lead to, you know, Alzheimer's in the late life. But there's, you know, there's just such a dramatic set of frontiers when it comes to aging research that, you know, so what I often like to say is that if you want to engineer a car to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles an hour, that's fine. You can basically, you know, fix a few components. If you wanted to now go at 400 miles an hour, you have to completely redesign the entire car because the system has just not evolved to go that far. Basically our human body has only evolved to live to, I don't know, 120, maybe we can get to 150 with minor changes. But if, you know, as we start pushing these frontiers for not just living, but well living, the Fzine that we talked about last time. So to basically push Fzine into the 80s and 90s and a hundreds and, you know, much further than that, we will face new challenges that have, you know, never been faced before in te
he neocortex. It's remarkably similar. It's like, yes, you see variations of it here and there, more of the cell, less and less, and so on. But what Malcastle argued was, he says, you know, if you take a section of neocortex, why is one a visual area and one is a auditory area? Or why is, and his answer was, it's because one is connected to eyes and one is connected to ears. Literally, you mean just it's most closest in terms of number of connections to the sensor. Literally, literally, if you took the optic nerve and attached it to a different part of the neocortex, that part would become a visual region. This actually, this experiment was actually done by Merkankasur in developing, I think it was lemurs, I can't remember what it was, some animal. And there's a lot of evidence to this. You know, if you take a blind person, a person who's born blind at birth, they're born with a visual neocortex. It doesn't, may not get any input from the eyes because of some congenital defect or something. And that region becomes, does something else. It picks up anoth
ut whether it takes 100 years or 500 or 5000 I find hard to estimate do you have some folks have worries about the different trajectories that path would take even existential threats of an AGI system do you have such concerns whether in the short term or the long term? I do worry about the long term fate of humanity I do wonder as well I do worry about overpopulation on the planet Mars just not today I think there will be a day when maybe someday in the future Mars will be polluted there are all these children dying and someone will look back at this video and say Andrew how is Andrew so heartless? He didn't care about all these children dying on the planet Mars and I apologize to the future viewer I do care about the children but I just don't know how to productively work on that today your picture will be in the dictionary for the people who are ignorant about the overpopulation on Mars yes so it's a long term problem is there something in the short term we should be thinking about in terms of aligning the values of our 
rkets ends up centralizing all of it into one power plant, I don't see that as a problem. There are places, there's a small town with only one barber shop. Is that a catastrophe? No, because they don't need two barber shops. Now, if that barber shop started to take advantage of people, started to charge higher price, well, then that's just an opportunity for others to step in and put them in their place. And that's the same thing with power plants. It's the same thing with everything. Ultimately, I think the key thing is this. From the central planning perspective, they'll present you the problem as it is, and they'll tell you, well, this is bad. So the fix, and what we can do is better. So let's stop what's bad and do what is better. Two problems here. Usually, the reason that the thing is bad in the first place is because it is a government monopoly. It's because of government intervention. But the second thing is that this notion that we could just pass a law and fix what's wrong and make it better, it ignores the fundamental underlying reality, w
way, like millions of squares away, the other teams, the other programs has expanded memory in order to take that into account until they run out of memory and crashed. And then you win a tournament by crashing all your opponents. I think that's quite a profound example, which probably applies to most games, from even a game theoretic perspective, that sometimes to win, you don't have to be better within the rules of the game. You have to come up with ways to break your opponent's brain, if it's a human, like not through violence, but through some hack where the brain just is not, you're basically, how would you put it? You're going outside the constraints of where the brain is able to function. Expectations of your opponent. I mean, this was even Kasparov pointed that out that when Deep Blue was playing against Kasparov, that it was not playing the same way as Kasparov expected. And this has to do with not having the same biases. And that's really one of the strengths of the AI approach. Can you at a high level say, what are the basic mec
ore information, it will do that, yeah? If exploration, space exploration or whatever is necessary, right, to gathering information and develop it. So it has a lot of instrumental goals falling on this information gain. And this agent is completely autonomous of us. No rewards necessary anymore. Yeah, of course, it could find a way to game the concept of information and get stuck in that library that you mentioned beforehand with a very large number of books. The first agent had this problem. It would get stuck in front of an old TV screen, which has just had white noise. Yeah, white noise, yeah. But the second version can deal with at least stochasticity. Well. Yeah, what about curiosity? This kind of word, curiosity, creativity, is that kind of the reward function being of getting new information? Is that similar to idea of kind of injecting exploration for its own sake inside the reward function? Do you find this at all appealing, interesting? I think that's a nice definition. Curiosity is rewards. Sorry, curiosity is exploration for its o
 stock market with as little as $1. Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square, a member SIPC. Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating. I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history. Debits and credits on ledgers started over 30,000 years ago. The US dollar was created over 200 years ago, and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, released just over 10 years ago. So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development, but it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Andrew Ng. The courses you taught on machine learning at Stanford and later on Co
, as an engineer? This is one of these questions where I always blank out. And then when I'm walking out the door, I'll, I'll remember 12, so this is a random selection that doesn't represent the top. The top ones, um, well, I mentioned, you know, gulag archipelago and it's kind of a hefty and dark, but, and then it has a personal connection as well. Yeah. Just like where you found the book to the part, the time in your life, where you found it, who recommended it. That's also part of the story. Yeah. So there's definitely that there's, you know, I, I circle back to Moby Dick a lot, um, because we read it in a, uh, a really great English class I had in high school. And I came in with an oppositional stance because I thought that the teacher was going to try to talk me into having all kinds of highfalutin ideas about allegory and what does this mean? What's the symbolism? And it turned out that, uh, it turned out to be a lot more interesting and satisfying than that. Um, what was the first powerful book you remember reading that like convinced you that thi
degree, but I think some people are more corruptible than others. And I find that there is, I mean, I like to think that Satoshi Nakamoto's out there and, you know, just like George Washington chose to walk away and it's a principle. And the principle is more powerful than the financial reward or any of those kinds of things. It's a principle that stands for freedom. And there's a lot of people throughout history, even recent history, that are willing to die for these principles or live a life full of suffering and sacrifice because they're still living a life of principle and choosing that day after day after day. So, I mean, there's power to that. Money, what's the worth of money in the end? In terms of just personal financial gain versus knowing how much positive impact there is. So the person that chooses to walk away like that, I think is the same kind of person that chooses to live by that principle. You have people like that, you know, in Grigori Grisha Perlman in mathematics who turned down the Fields Medal because he was. Yeah, th
 series of actionable targets that you can then couple with pharma and just go after systematically. So the ability to sort of bring genetics to the epigenomics, to the transcriptomics, to the cellular readouts using these sort of high throughput perturbation technologies that I'm talking about and ultimately to the organismal through the electronic health record endophenotypes and ultimately the disease battery of assays at the cognitive level, at the physiological level and, you know, every other level. There is no better or more exciting field, in my view, to be a computer scientist then or to be a scientist in period. Basically this confluence of technologies, of computation, of data, of insight and of tools for manipulation is unprecedented in human history. And I think this is what's shaping the next century to really be a transformative century for our species and for our planet. Do you think the 21st century will be remembered for the big leaps in understanding and alleviation of biology? If you look at the path between 
frequency of the gravitational wave. So the frequencies that we detect are higher than one a second, but that's the idea. And the amount is small. Amount is small, but if you're closer to the source of the wave, is it the same amount? Yeah, it doesn't dissipate. It doesn't dissipate. Okay, so it's not that fun of an amusement ride. Well, it does dissipate, but it's proportional to the distance. Right. It's not a big power. Right. Gotcha. But it would be a fun ride if you get a little bit closer or a lot closer. I mean, I wonder what the... Okay, this is a ridiculous question, but I have you here. I mean, the getting fatter and taller, I mean, that experience, for some reason, that's mind blowing to me because it brings the distortion of space time to you. I mean, space time is being morphed, right? Like this is a wave. That's right. That's so weird. And we're in space, so we're affected by it. Yeah, we're in space and now it's moving. It's moving. I don't know what to do with it. I mean, does it... Okay. How much do you think about the philosophical implications of general 
ve. I apologize, I love Portugal. That's another discussion we should get into at some point. Because you posted a few soccer things. I'm not, I realize how passionate people are about this. Listen, it was a joke, all right? He deserves to be potentially in the top five. Yeah, I love Portugal. And even though I'm a Liverpool fan, I still respect Cristiano Ronaldo a lot. In fact, I hold a very unpopular opinion where I think Cristiano Ronaldo's the greatest football player ever. Number one, over Pelé and Maradona, Messi, better than Messi. Yes, he's been doing it for 20 years at the top. Nobody's ever done that. He's won everything everywhere, everywhere he goes at the top, at the Champions League. Really strong argument to be made for him. Messi's never done anything outside of Barcelona, that's the thing. So you appreciate performance, long term, versus the genius of the actual play on the field. I mean, the genius is, Ronaldo's the top scorer of all time. He scores more goals. So the genius is in the scoring, not the actual dance of the play, the creativity. 
, and touch. They don't look any different. Or they look only marginally different. And so one would say, well, if Vernon Mountcastle, who proposed that all the parts of the neocortex do the same thing, if he's right, then the parts that are doing language or mathematics or physics are working on the same principle. They must be working on the principle of reference frames. So that's a little odd thought. But of course, we had no prior idea how these things happen. So let's go with that. And we, in our recent paper, we talked a little bit about that. I've been working on it more since. I have better ideas about it now. I'm sitting here very confident that that's what's happening. And I can give you some examples that help you think about that. It's not we understand it completely, but I understand it better than I've described it in any paper so far. So, but we did put that idea out there. It says, okay, this is, it's a good place to start, you know? And the evidence would suggest it's how it's happening. And then we can start tackling that problem one 
, take curiosity and let artificial intelligence or machine learning run away with having its solutions to whatever you want, or we do it, it's, I think, a similar consequence. I think from what I've read about Enrico Fermi, he became a little bit cynical about the human species towards the end of his life, both having observed what he observed. Well, he didn't write much. I mean, he died young. He died soon after the World War. There was already, you know, the work by Teller to develop the hydrogen bomb. And I think he was a little cynical of that, you know, pushing it even further and rising tensions between the Soviet Union and the U.S. and looked like an endless thing. So, but he didn't say very much, but a little bit, as you said. Yeah, there's a few clips to sort of maybe picked on a bad mood, but in a sense that almost like a sadness, a melancholy sadness to a hope that waned a little bit about that perhaps we can do, like this curious species can find the way out. Well, especially, I think, people who worked like he did at Los Alamos and s
ogether, they can radiate, give off some energy. So they don't just, they slow down. As a result, they lose energy. They can collaborate together, cool down, form things like stars, form things like planets. And so in broad terms, there's no mystery. There's, that's what the scenario, that's what the equations tell you should happen. But because it's a process involving many, many fundamental individual units, the application of the laws that govern individual units to these things is very delicate, computationally very difficult. And more profoundly, the equations have this probability of chaos or sensitivity to initial conditions, which tells you tiny differences in the initial state can lead to enormous differences in the subsequent behavior. So physics, fundamental physics at some point says, okay, chemists, biologists, this is your problem. And then again, in broad terms, we know how it's conceivable that the humans and things like that, how complex structure can emerge. It's a matter of having the right kind of temperature and the right kind o
uits. And integrated circuits actually starts like in the middle of this graph. And it has nothing to do with intel. Intel actually was a key part of this. But a few years ago, they stopped making the fastest chips. But if you take the fastest chip of any technology in that year, you get this kind of graph. And it's definitely continuing for 80 years. So you don't think Moore's law, broadly defined, is dead. It's been declared dead multiple times throughout this process. I don't like the term Moore's law, because it has nothing to do with Moore or with intel. But yes, the exponential growth of computing is continuing. It has never stopped. From various sources. I mean, it went through World War II, it went through global recessions. It's just continuing. And if you continue that out, along with software gains, which is a whole nother issue, and they really multiply, whatever you get from software gains, you multiply by the computer gains, you get faster and faster speed. This is actually the fastest computer models that have been created. And that 
h, you have to sleep in synchrony with it and harmony. Because normally what we know is that if you fight biology, you'll normally lose. And the way you know you've lost is through disease and sickness. You said you suffered through several bouts of insomnia. Is there, aside from embracing your chronotype, is there advice you can give how to overcome insomnia from your own experience? Right now the best method that we have is something called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or CBTI for short. And you work with, for people who don't know what it is, you work with a therapist for maybe six weeks and you can do it online, by the way, I recommend probably jumping online, it's just the easiest. And it will change your beliefs, your habits, your behaviors and your general stress around this thing called sleep. And it is just as effective as sleeping pills in the short term. But what's great is that unlike sleeping pills, when you stop working with your therapist, those benefits last for years later. Whereas when you stop your sleepi
ple are using them and it's sort of like, okay, what now? Where does this all lead? So... Do you have a sense of where it all leads? Like is it possible that the set of technology kind of continues to have transformational effects on not just sort of finance but who gets to have power in this world? So the decentralization of power. Big questions, right? So I guess there's a little bit of the cynic in me thinking that as soon as it becomes important enough, the existing banks and people in power are gonna sort of control it. I guess an easy answer is that maybe it won't be a big change in the end. There's a utopian strain sometimes in the way people think about this that I'm not so sure about. There is a technological aspect to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that make it a little easier to pull along the utopian thread because it's harder for governments to control Bitcoin. I mean, they have much fewer options. They can ban, they can make it illegal. It's more difficult. So technology here is on the side of the powerless, the voiceles
by it already. I mean, you can talk to it and have a conversation with it. You can actually talk to it for hours. So it requires a little more depth. There's some problems with large language models which we can talk about. But some people are convinced by the Turing test. Now, if somebody passes the Turing test, what are the implications of that? Does that mean that they're sentient, that they're conscious or not? It's not necessarily clear what the implications are. Anyway, I believe 2029, that's six, seven years from now, we'll have something that passes the Turing test and a valid Turing test, meaning it goes for hours, not just a few minutes. Can you speak to that a little bit? What is your formulation of the Turing test? You've proposed a very difficult version of the Turing test, so what does that look like? Basically, it's just to assess it over several hours and also have a human judge that's fairly sophisticated on what computers can do and can't do. If you take somebody who's not that sophisticated or even an average engineer, they may not
ld need to dissipate. Well, this is true. Well, then you would have to stop being whatever it is that you took on as your ideological or religious point, right? Yeah, I mean, there's some days I'm Ancom, some days I'm Ancaps and whatever the anarchic capital. I mean, it depends on the hour, the minute of the day, you constantly changing moods and embracing that flow, the change of opinions, of ideas. As there's some days like, I'm actually cognizant of the fact because I've been not getting my sleep. And after I get some sleep, I see I'm so much more optimistic about the world. The less and less sleep I get, the more sad and cynical I get. I can see that. There's an up and down constantly. I don't even let my, well, okay. I try not to let. And most days it's never a problem. Any sort of like, what the kids call it now, blackpilled way of thinking, be my over, the umbrella which I hang under. So we actually, to drag us back, can we talk about Carl Gotch and Cat Tressley? Because I do want to make sure I touch it. I mean, what, who were? Carl Gotch is. Is he the
exist. And that's why the examples are so relevant of the things you've outlined in your life. I hope those things, the books people write, the experiences people build, the conversations you have, your relationship with your AI systems, I hope those all are feeding on the insights built upon this ecosystem we've created to better your life. And so that's the thinking behind it. Again, with the Drake equation being the underlying driver of value. And the people at Kernel have joined not because we have certainty of success, but because we find it to be the most exhilarating opportunity we could ever pursue in this time to be alive. You founded the payment system Braintree in 2007 that acquired Venmo in 2012, in that same year was acquired by PayPal, which is now eBay. Can you tell me the story of the vision and the challenge of building an online payment system and just building a large successful business in general? I discovered payments by accident. When I was 21, I just returned from Ecuador living among extreme poverty for two years. And
 joined and kind of circled them. And then when they circled them, they could actually herd the zebras together and eat multiple zebras. So there was like an arms race of predators and prey. And they gradually developed more complex behaviors, some of which we actually do see in nature. And this kind of coevolution, that's competitive coevolution, it's a fascinating topic because there's a promise or possibility that you will discover something new that you don't already know. You didn't build it in. It came from this arms race. It's hard to keep the arms race going. It's hard to have rich enough simulation that supports all of these complex behaviors. But at least for several steps, we've already seen it in this predator prey scenario, yeah. First of all, it's fascinating to think about this context in terms of evolving architectures. So I've studied Tesla autopilot for a long time. It's one particular implementation of an AI system that's operating in the real world. I find it fascinating because of the scale at which it's used out in the 
d it be AGI or the theory of everything? Definitely AGI, because once the AGI problem is solved, I can ask the AGI to solve the other problem for me. Yeah, brilliant input. Okay, so as you were saying about it. Okay, so, and the reason why I didn't settle, I mean, this thought about, once you have solved AGI, it solves all kinds of other, not just the theory of every problem, but all kinds of more useful problems to humanity is very appealing to many people. And I had this thought also, but I was quite disappointed with the state of the art of the field of AI. There was some theory about logical reasoning, but I was never convinced that this will fly. And then there was this more heuristic approaches with neural networks and I didn't like these heuristics. So, and also I didn't have any good idea myself. So that's the reason why I toggled back and forth quite some while and even worked four and a half years in a company developing software, something completely unrelated. But then I had this idea about the ICSE model. And so what it gives 
gs I do and what are the things, it's probably important to do without the data, but the data will certainly help. It's like rank all the things you do in life and which ones make you feel shitty, which ones make you feel good. Like you're talking about evening, Brian. Like this is a good example, somebody like, I do pig out at night as well. And it never makes me feel good. Like you're in a safe space. This is a safe space, let's hear it. No, I definitely have much less self control at night and it's interesting. And the same, people might criticize this, but I know my own body. I know when I eat carnivores, just eat meat, I feel much better than if I eat more carbs. The more carbs I eat, the worse I feel. I don't know why that is. There is science supporting it, but I'm not leaning on science. I'm leaning on personal experience and that's really important. I don't need to read, I'm not gonna go on a whole rant about nutrition science, but many of those studies are very flawed. They're doing their best, but nutrition science is a very difficult field o
en around me and many children around this world that are being taught to hate someone who's different than them just because the person who's allegedly teaching them says so. I don't understand it. Well, that starts with just having a basic respect and appreciation of other human beings and that starts with empathy. And one of the reasons I love this country, while joking that I'm Russian, maybe you could say the same as you being Irish, you're actually truly an American and that's why I consider myself very much an American. And one of the reasons I love this country is it serves as a beacon. I still believe it serves as a beacon of hope and that empathy and love for the rest of the world that hate is not gonna get you far, that love will get you a lot farther. And I still think sometimes it's easy to see the press, mainstream media, you could see social networks. Because you can make so much money on division, sometimes because it makes so much money, it's easy to think like we're really divided. I honestly don't think we are. That's 
ys of isolating individual cells, putting them into a well for every one of these cells. So you have 384 well plates and you now do 384 parallel reactions to measure the expression But the moment you sort of break up that very long path into smaller levels, you can basically say from genetics, what are the epigenomic alterations at the level of gene regulatory elements where that genetic variant perturbs the control region nearby. That effect is much larger. You mean much larger in terms of this down the line impact or? It's much larger in terms of the measurable effect, this A versus B variance is actually so much cleanly defined when you go to the shorter branches. Because for one genetic variant to affect Alzheimer's, that's a very long path. That basically means that in the context of millions of these 6 million variants that every one of us carries, that one single nucleotide has a detectable effect all the way to the end. I mean, it's just mind boggling that that's even possible, but indeed there are such effects. So the hope is, o
you can't use it to settle trade internationally, which therefore means demand for it monetarily is limited. And so it's becoming more and more an industrial metal. And as a result of the fact that its value doesn't keep up with inflation, it becomes economical to use it in industry. So we're seeing gold become like silver in that it gets used in industry. So the stockpile declines. And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well, and it becomes more and more of an industrial metal. And it can't protect your wealth over time very well. So what do you do? Well, you could invest. And this is kind of the obvious answer that Keynesian will give you is, well, you just put your money in an investment. But investment is different from saving. Saving, the whole point of saving is that the thing is liquid and that the thing carries little uncertainty. You just held the gold coin and it just sat there. It did nothing. It didn't take risk. You knew that it was gonna be there in 10 years. Investment means you give the gold coin to somebody to go and d
spective. There's a big challenge in the machine learning community of how to build systems that are able to remember for prolonged periods of time, lifelong continuous learning. So where you build up information over time. So memory is one of the biggest open problems in AI and machine learning. But at the same time, the right way to formulate memory is actually forgetting because you have to be exceptionally selective at which kind of stuff you remember. And that's where the step of assimilation, integration that you're referring to is really important. I mean, we forget most of the things. And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting at the very edge of stuff that could be important or could not be, how do we remember or not those things? Like for example, doing a podcast, I've become cognizant of one feature of my forgetting that's been problematic, which is I forget names and titles of books and so on. So when I read, I remember ideas. I remember quotes, I remember statements and like that's the space in which I'm thinking. B
eople there. Even when I was there, there were about 50 or 60 there. And in the winter, there's less, half of that. Their winter. Yeah. It gets real cold. It gets really cold, yeah. But it's a station. And I think, and that's, I mean, we haven't gone beyond that. On the coast of Antarctica, they have greenhouses and they're self sustaining in McMurdo Station, but we haven't really settled more than that kind of thing in Antarctica, which is a big country or a big plot, a big piece of land. So I don't, I can't envision kind of colonizing at people living so much, as much as I can see the equivalent There's people that engineer viruses to protect us from viruses to see how close is this to mutating so it can jump to humans or engineering defenses against those. And it seems exciting and the application, the positive applications are really exciting at this time, but we don't think about how that runs away in decades to come. Yeah. And I think it's the same idea as this little book, The Ratchet of Science, The Ratchet of Curiosity. I mean, whether you pursue
 a guy called John Osborne. So in the 1920s, I think his name was Montagu. He was the chief of the Bank of England. He commissioned one of his secretaries, John Osborne, to study what the bank did during World War I. And it was a study that was kept under wraps, a confidential, in the Bank of England, only released in 2017, almost a century later. And. What was special about 2017, by the way, it's a year. It's just it was a year in which some of this information was released. Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements of the Bank of England and found this and published it and now you can download it as a PDF and find all of the amazing details. So they confiscated the gold and they forced people to use the paper and they promised people that as soon as the war was gonna be over, this is temporary, we're gonna be back to using gold. And of course, you know, if you told people in Britain, this is the real scam about fiat. If you told people in Britain in 1914, hey, we're gonna go off the gold standard because it's better. I mean, there might've been
desk used to face a wall instead of seeing, and people would say, well, don't you wanna look out the window? But I'm in here, I mean, I'm seeing, you know, the Spartans, I'm seeing, you know, whatever. And the characters that are on the page, or that you create, are not accidents, you know? They're coming out of some issue, some deep issue that you have. Whether you realize it or not, you might not realize it till 20 years later, or somebody explains it to you. So your characters are kind of fascinating to you. And their dilemmas are fascinating to you. And you're also trying to come to grips with them, you know, you sort of see them through a glass darkly, you know, and you really wanna see them more clearly. So yeah, no, it's not lonely at all. In fact, I'm more lonely sometimes later, going out to dinner with some people and actually talking to people. Do you miss the characters after it's over? Let's say I have affection for them, kind of like children that have gone off to college and now are, you know, you only see them at Thanksgiving. Definitely, I hav
Beatles White album, is much more of a studio band than you think at first. And in the case of Bruce Springsteen, I don't know about you, but for me, he's somebody that I connect with the most when I'm alone and there's like a melancholy feeling. And actually, my folks live in Philly. I went to school in Philly. And so, you know, I've, I think I've. You're almost worthy of New Jersey then. Yeah, well you're, you're almost worthy of Russia. So we're, we can connect. And then ask, but I mean, I love Jersey. This is something I feel like, I feel like, I don't know. It's always, there's this beautiful, like there's a diner, Olga's Diner that closed down. I used to go there. There's, there's a melancholy feeling to me. I mean, of course. A thickness to culture in that part of the world. Which is oddly similar to some elements of the thickness of Russian culture. And when you see like Russian characters on the Sopranos, it totally makes sense, even though there are these complete outliers. Exactly, it totally makes sense. You've, you mentioned you lost your father in law la
realizing how much that actually changed people or societies, but to predict that before the internet would have been very difficult, and in that same way, we're sitting here with the fog before us, thinking, what is superintelligence systems, how is that going to change the world? What is increasing the bandwidth, like plugging our brains into this whole thing, how is that going to change the world? And it seems like it's a fog, you don't know, and it could be, it could, whatever comes to be, could destroy the world, we could be the last generation, but it also could transform in ways that creates an incredibly fulfilling life experience that's unlike anything we've ever experienced. It might involve dissolution of ego and consciousness and so on, you're no longer one individual, it might be more, you know, that might be a certain kind of death, an ego death, but the experience might be really exciting and enriching, maybe we'll live in a virtual, like it's like, it's funny to think about a bunch of sort of hypothetical questions of would it b
e virtue of selfishness. Ayn Rand was a big influence on me growing up. The book that really mattered for me was Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal. The notion that wealth creates opportunity and good lives and wealth is something we ought to valorize and give very high status. It's one of her key ideas. I think it's completely correct. I think she has the most profound and articulate statement of that idea. That said, as a philosopher, I disagree with her on most things. And I did, even like as a boy, when I was reading her, I read Plato before Ayn Rand. And in a Socratic dialogue, there's all these different points of view being thrown around. And whomever it is you agree with, you understand the wisdom is in the coming together of the different points of view. And she doesn't have that. So altruism can be wonderful in my view. Humans are not actually that rational. Self interest is often poorly defined. To pound the table and say existence exists. I wouldn't say I disagree, but I'm not sure that it's a very meaningful statement. I think the se
st satisfaction of pushing through? I think it's humbling. And I wasn't thinking about what I was feeling. I think one thing that I'm proud to say we got right from the early days was I told my whole team back then that the number one priority is to do what's best for learners, do what's best for students. And so when I went to the recording studio, the only thing on my mind was what can I say? How can I design my slides? What I need to draw right to make these concepts as clear as possible for learners? I think I've seen sometimes instructors is tempting to, hey, let's talk about my work. Maybe if I teach you about my research, someone will cite my papers a couple more times. And I think one of the things we got right, launching the first few MOOCs and later building Coursera, was putting in place that bedrock principle of let's just do what's best for learners and forget about everything else. And I think that that is a guiding principle turned out to be really important to the rise of the MOOC movement. And the kind of learner you i
now that this would happen even at Skidmore anymore. But I was very lucky to be given the latitude and to be encouraged. I took classes at Skidmore. That's how I learned all this stuff. I graduated, I got a PhD unscathed by knowledge. We were great statisticians and methodologists, but we didn't have any substance. And I don't mean this cynically, but we were trained in a method in search of a question. So I appreciate having five years at Skidmore basically to read books. And I also appreciate that I look like this 40 years ago. And my view is that this is how I comported myself. Other people, the guy I learned the most from at Skidmore is now dead, a history professor, Ted Kuroda. He wore a bow tie. And there's another guy, Darnell Rucker, who taught me about philosophy. And he was very proper. And he had his jacket with the leather patches. But these guys weren't pompous at all. They were, this is the way I am. And I always felt that that's important that somebody who looks at you and says, oh, what a stiff, he's probably an MBA. Well, they're wr
 got some input coming into it and it's gonna have reference frames where it's assigned that input to. And each square millimeter can learn complete models of objects. So what do I mean by that? If I'm touching the coffee cup, well, if I just touch it in one place, I can't learn what this coffee cup is because I'm just feeling one part. But if I move it around the cup and touch it at different areas, I can build up a complete model of the cup because I'm now filling in that three dimensional map, which is the coffee cup. I can say, oh, what am I feeling at all these different locations? That's the basic idea, it's more complicated than that. But so through time, and we talked about time earlier, through time, even a single column, which is only looking at, or a single part of the cortex, which is only looking at a small part of the world, can build up a complete model of an object. And so if you think about the part of the brain, which is getting input from all my fingers, so they're spread across the top of your head here. This is the somatos
nd technologists about fear of death and the meaning of life. And on the fear of death, they often like don't say anything interesting. What I mean by that is they haven't thought deeply about it. Like you kind of brought this up a few times of really letting it sink in. They kind of say this thing about what exactly you said, which is like, it's something that happens not today. Like I'm aware that it's something that happens. And I'm not, the thing they usually say is I'm not afraid of death. I just want to live a good life kind of thing. And what I'm trying to express is like when I look in their eyes and the kind of the core of the conversation, it looks like they haven't really become, like they haven't really meditated on death. I guess the question is, what do I say to people that there's something to really think about here? Like there's some demons, some realities that need to be faced by more people. Well, that's a tough one. You know, I could tell you what not to do. So when we are young and annoying, a lot of famous people, mostly psy
ooking at? What is the sensory information they've taken in? And the theory of mind piece comes in is what are they actually attending to cognitively? And also what are they thinking about? Like what is the computation they're performing? And you have probably maybe a few options for the pedestrian crossing. It doesn't have to be, it's like a variable with a few discrete states, but you have to have a good estimation which of the states that brain is in for the pedestrian case. And the same is for attending with a robot. If you're collaborating to pick up an object, you have to figure out is the human, like there's a few discrete states that the human could be in. You have to predict that by observing the human. And that seems like a machine learning problem to figure out what's the human up to. It's not as simple as sort of planning just because they move their arm means the arm will continue moving in this direction. You have to really have a model of what they're thinking about and what's the motivation behind the movement of the a
d, like this is the part that controls heart rate, and this is the part that controls this, and this is this kind of thing, and that's this kind of thing, and these evolved for eons a long, long time, and they have their specific functions, and all of a sudden mammals come along, and they got this thing called the neocortex, and it got large by just replicating the same thing over and over and over again. This is like, wow, this is incredible. So all the evidence we have, and this is an idea that was first articulated in a very cogent and beautiful argument by a guy named Vernon Malcastle in 1978, I think it was, that the neocortex all works on the same principle. So language, hearing, touch, vision, engineering, all these things are basically underlying, are all built on the same computational substrate. They're really all the same problem. So the low level of the building blocks all look similar. Yeah, and they're not even that low level. We're not talking about like neurons. We're talking about this very complex circuit that exists throughout t
 other hand, we can get help from our Silicon friends and we can get help from all kinds of instruments that make up for our perceptual deficits. And we can use, at a conceptual level, we can use different kinds of concepts to address different kinds of questions. So I'm not sure exactly what problem she's talking about. It's a problem akin to an organism living in a 2D plane trying to understand a three dimensional world. Well, we can do that. I mean, in fact, for practical purposes, most of our experience is two dimensional. It's hard to move vertically. And yet we've produced conceptually a three dimensional symmetry and in fact, four dimensional space time. So by thinking in appropriate ways and using instruments and getting consistent accounts and rich accounts, we find out what concepts are necessary. And I don't see any end in sight of the process or any showstoppers because, let me give you an example. I mean, for instance, QCD, our theory of the strong interaction, has nice equations, which I helped to discover. What's QCD? Quantum ch
all technique and it's all this and it's the gentle art and blah. Bro, I have rolled with ADCC world champions, you know, some of the best you have ever heard of. There ain't a lot of gentleness when it comes to like, oh yeah, they wanted to sweep you and you said no. And then you did, said no again. And then you said no and attacked their leg. Yeah. It ceases to be all that gentle because at the end of the day, these dudes are strong as hell. They're flexible. They're all, I mean, they're, the difference between the athleticism and the ability to actually win is a pretty wide gap. The athleticism shows up, but then there's all that other extra and part of that is meanness and pain and getting what you need out of it. But see, there is a philosophical difference in the way it's thought because. I think some of it is just, they just in denial. Like, oh, people will, they like to, people like to espouse a lot of things as theory and then it's like, okay, let me watch. When they're, oh, you're not doing anything about what you said right now. In fact, you're 
similar kind of sense of the cruelty of human nature, cruelty of indifference, but also the ability to find happiness in the small joys of life. That's something, there's nothing like a prison camp that makes you realize you could still be happy with a very, very little. Yeah, his description of how to go through a day and actually enjoy it in a prison camp is pretty amazing. And some prison camp, it's the worst of the worst. And also, I do think about the role of authoritarian states in hopeful idealistic systems somehow leading to the suffering of millions. And this might be arguable, but I think a lot of people believe that Stalin, I think, genuinely believed that he's doing good for the world. And he wasn't. It's a very valuable lesson that even evil people think they're doing good. Otherwise, it's too difficult to do the evil. The best way to do evil is to believe about framing it in a way like you're doing good. And then this is a very clear picture of that, which is the gulags. And Solzhenitsyn is one of the best people to reveal tha
xhausted, you know? And then I'll come home and handle whatever correspondence and stuff has to be done, and then I work for maybe three hours, and then I just sort of crash. The office is closed, I turn the switch, I don't think about anything. I don't think about the work at all. Do you listen to, oh, you mean afterwards? After work, once the office is closed. But during, so this was like 12 to three kind of thing? Something like that, yeah. Something like that, okay. You listen to music? No. Do you have anything? But that's just me, I mean, I don't think, you know, but somebody could do it a million different ways. It's fascinating, you know, the, I mean, you've also, of most, of many writers, you've really, but like I've read Stephen Kington writing, you've optimized this conversation with the muse you're having. Not optimized, but you've at least thought about it. So what's, can you say a little bit more about the trivialities of that process, of the, like you said, facing the wall? What's, do you have little rituals? You mean like the granular aspect of it? The gran
e didn't invent the first telescope, but made a telescope, looked at Neptune and saw that it had four moons. That was the birth of not just using your eyes to understand what's out there. And since that time, we've made better and better telescopes, obviously, and astronomy thrives. And in a similar way, we're starting to be able to crawl, but we're starting to be able to do that with gravitational waves. And it's going to be more and more that we can do as we can make better and better instruments because, as I say, it's not limited by picking it out of others. Yeah, it's not limited by the physics. So you have an optimism about engineering that as human progress marches on, engineering will always find a way to build a large enough device, accurate enough device to detect the same thing. As long as it's not limited by physics, yeah, they'll do it. So you, two other folks and the entire team won the Nobel prize for this big effort. There's a million questions I can ask for, but looking back, where does the Nobel prize fit into all of this? If yo
remature, that you put in an incubator, put him in an incubator or her, they're highly likely to survive. If you don't have 24 hour electricity, that child is not gonna make it. And you see it, you know, the level of energy consumption per capita is highly correlated, not just to income, but also to health outcomes, to infant mortality, to all of the things that you care about. And Bitcoin is just another technology. It does consume a lot more energy than central banks. A lot of Bitcoiners like to take a cop out of this by saying, well, you know, central banks consume money and ATMs consume a lot of energy. And I think if you calculate how much central banks and banks consume, I think it's a rounding error next to what Bitcoin consumes. I think Bitcoin is just, maybe not a rounding error, but it's still, Bitcoin I think is going to consume a lot more, and that's a good thing. You know what's humbling is to look, because even just looking into this forces me to look at the energy expenditures for many of the things we take for granted. Obviously
asically have many perturbations of the same gene in different people, each with a different frequency in the human population and each with a different effect on the individual that carries them. So you said in the past there would be these small experiments on perturbations and animal models. What does this puzzle solving process look like today? So we basically have something like 7 billion people in the planet and every one of them carries something like 6 million mutations. You basically have an enormous matrix of genotype by phenotype by systematically measuring the phenotype of these individuals. And the traditional way of measuring this phenotype has been to look at one trait at a time. You would gather families and you would sort of paint the pedigrees of a strong effect, what we like to call Mendelian mutation, so a mutation that gets transmitted in a dominant or a recessive, but strong effect form where basically one locus plays a very big role in that disease. And you could then look at carriers versus non car
hing is for when you take exams or you go and take classes, the closer or paper deadlines, the closer you get to a deadline, the better you start to perform and get your shit together and actually get stuff done. I'm really not so negative on human nature. And as an economist, I very much see the gains from cooperation. But if you just ask, are there outliers in history? Like was there a Hitler, for instance? Obviously. And again, you let the clock tick, another Hitler with nuclear weapons, doesn't per se care about his own destruction, it will happen. So your sense is fundamentally people are good, but outliers happen. A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it. Trembling hand equilibrium? That the basic logic is for cooperation, which is mostly what we've seen, even between enemies. But every now and then someone does something crazy and you don't know how to react to it. And you can't always beat Hitler. Sometimes Hitler drags you down. To push back, is it possible that the crazier the person, the less likely they are, and in a w
 one of the things that neuroscientists just sort of missed for many, many years, and especially people who were thinking about theory, was the nature of time in the brain. Brains process information through time. The information coming into the brain is constantly changing. The patterns from my speech right now, if you were listening to it at normal speed, would be changing on your ears about every 10 milliseconds or so, you'd have a change. This constant flow, when you look at the world, your eyes are moving constantly, three to five times a second, and the input's completely changing. If I were to touch something like a coffee cup, as I move my fingers, the input changes. So this idea that the brain works on time changing patterns is almost completely, or was almost completely missing from a lot of the basic theories, like fears of vision and so on. It's like, oh no, we're gonna put this image in front of you and flash it and say, what is it? Convolutional neural networks work that way today, right? Classify this picture. But that's not wha
 meaning. I think if you study different cultures, the arts, travel, mathematics, like whatever your thing is, you'll get a lot about the meaning of life. So like it's there in Wikipedia in some bigger sense. But I don't want to read the page on the meaning. I bet they have such a page, in fact. The fact that I've never visited it, none of my friends, oh, here, Tyler, here's the page on the meaning of life. I know you've been wondering about this. You got to read this one. No one's ever done that to you, have they? It probably has, well, I've actually gone to that page. It does, in fact, have a lot of links to other pages. Okay. So that's it. The meaning of life is just a bunch of self referential or citation needed type of statements. I think there's no better way to end it. Tyler, it's a huge honor. I'm a huge fan. Thank you so much for wasting all of this time with me. It was one of the greatest conversations I've ever had. Thank you so much. My pleasure and delighted to finally have met you and that we can do this. Thanks for listening to this conversatio
ted billions of different mRNA sequences, and they found the ones that were the best, and they created the vaccine. And they did, and talked about doing that quickly, they did that in two days. Now, how long would a human being take to simulate billions of different mRNA sequences? I don't know that we could do it at all, but it would take many years. They did it in two days, and one of the reasons that people didn't like vaccines is because it was done too quickly, it was done too fast. And they actually included the time it took to test it out, which was 10 months, so they figured, okay, it took 10 months to create this. Actually, it took us two days. And we also will be able to ultimately do the tests in a few days as well. Oh, because we can simulate how the body will respond to it. Yeah, that's a little bit more complicated because the body has a lot of different elements, and we have to simulate all of that, but that's coming as well. So ultimately, we could create it in a few days and then test it in a few days, and it would be done. And w
ings that could be lucrative that I won't do but if we can find ways to serve people in meaningful ways I think those can be great things to do either in the academic setting or in a corporate setting or a startup setting so can you give me the idea of why you started the AI fund I remember when I was leading the AI group at Baidu I had two jobs two parts of my job one was to build an AI engine to support the existing businesses and that was running just ran just performed by itself there was a second part of my job at the time which was to try to systematically initiate new lines of businesses using the company's AI capabilities so you know the self driving car team came out of my group the smart speaker team similar to what is Amazon Echo Alexa in the US but we actually announced it before Amazon did so Baidu wasn't following Amazon that came out of my group and I found that to be actually the most fun part of my job so what I wanted to do was to build AI fund as a startup studio to systematically create new s
 this other class, which I like to call polyfactorial diseases, which are basically lighting up everywhere. And in many ways it's, you know, sort of cutting across these walls that were previously built across these departments. And the polyfactorial ones were probably the previous structural departments wasn't equipped to deal with those. I mean, again, maybe it's a romanticized question, but you know, there's in physics, there's a theory of everything. Do you think it's possible to move towards an almost theory of everything of disease from a genetic perspective? So if this unification continues, is it possible that, like, do you think in those terms, like trying to arrive at a fundamental understanding of how disease emerges, period? That unification is not just foreseeable, it's inevitable. I see it as inevitable. We have to go there. You cannot be a specialist anymore. If you're a genomicist, you have to be a specialist in every single disorder. And the reason for that is that the fundamental understanding of the circuitry of the human ge
ell our enemies that they may take our lives with growing excitement, but they'll never take our freedom. I get excited every time I see that in the movie, but that's kind of how I approach life and eating. Do you think they were tracking their sleep? They were not tracking their sleep and they ate way too much brisket and they were fat, unhealthy, died early, and were primitive. But there's something in my ape brain that's attracted to that, even though most of my life is fully aligned with the way you see yours. Part of it is for comedy, of course, but part of it is I'm almost afraid of overoptimization. Really what you're saying though, if we're looking at this, let's say from a first principles perspective, when you read those words, they conjure up certain life experiences, but you're basically saying, I experienced a certain neurotransmitter state when these things are in action. That's all you're saying. So whether it's that or something else, you're just saying you have a selection for how your state for your body. And so if you as an en
f it bothers you so much, ask yourself why it bothers you that some people are so, I'm not referring to you obviously, but I mean, the people that are constantly aggravated about this, I don't get bothered by anything on Twitter. I just block immediately. And I get to curate the experience that I enjoy. And I recommend people do that. It's really a lot less pathetic than complaining about strangers saying things you don't like, which a lot of, and of course the reason for it is, you know, I mean, when I say it's stupid, it's not really stupid. There's an ulterior motive there. And the ulterior motive is, hey, I have this shit coin that I made with five other friends of mine. And I'd like you to, I'd like to ride your coattails, Bitcoiners, and I'd like you to please help me promote this shit coin. Like this is, I get this practically every week, whether through email or through Twitter, where, hey, you know, this is our shit coin. You know, it's just like Bitcoin, but it's better because it does this and this and that. And, you know, basically how can we g
f centric to their own tribe. Like it seems like that's the kind of space we converged onto. I mean, I'm not an expert in anthropology, but it seems like we're very kind of good within our own tribe, but need to be taught to be nice to other tribes. Well, if you look at Steven Pinker, he highlights this pretty nicely in Better Angels of Our Nature, where he talks about violence decreasing over time consistently. So whatever tension, whatever teams we pick, it seems that the long arc of history goes towards us getting along more and more. So. I hope so. So do you think that, do you think it's possible to teach RL based robots this kind of kindness, this kind of ability to interact with humans, this kind of policy, even to, let me ask a fun one. Do you think it's possible to teach RL based robot to love a human being and to inspire that human to love the robot back? So to like RL based algorithm that leads to a happy marriage. That's an interesting question. Maybe I'll answer it with another question, right? Because I mean, but I'll come back to
ah. So you could get kind of a grounding in a lot of classic works of literature without actually reading them, which is, you know, it's great when you're nine years old. So, so I read a lot of that stuff, uh, for sure. The annotated Sherlock Holmes, um. You mentioned David Deutsch too, as an inspiration for some of your work. I mean, you've, you've obviously didn't like really a lot of research for the books you, you do. Roger Penrose. What, uh, do you remember a book that made you want to become a writer or a moment that made you become a writer? I think like the, you know, the answer I usually give is that when I was in like fifth grade and one of my friends came to school one day, he was wearing leather shoes, like dress shoes and I hated dress shoes cause mine never fit. And so they were uncomfortable. I couldn't run, you know, they were cold, it was Iowa. So I kind of said, I remember very clearly thinking, okay, I don't like where this is going. Like, does this mean that next year all of the kids are going to be wearing leather shoes? So I need 
homas Pickardy guy who writes about capital, and just makes the point that return on investment will always be greater than wages. That means the people with money are gonna have a lot more. That means there's gonna come a point where the economic house of cards falls apart. Now, the Joseph Schumpeters of the world, they're like, that's creative destruction, bring it, that's great. So I think it's Niles Ferguson, he's a historian, he may be at Stanford now, he was at Harvard. He writes about the history of money, and he's like, yeah, there's been 20 or whatever depressions and big recessions in the last several hundred years. And when that happens, half of the population or whatever is catastrophically inconvenienced. But that's the price that we pay for progress. Other people would argue, and I would agree with them that I will happily sacrifice the rate of progress in order to flatten the curve of economic destruction. To put that in plainer English, I would direct our attention to the social democracies that forgetting for the moment of whe
undamentally transformative to the entirety of the problem? What's your sense of it? Like, cause we all, we make that assumption quite often. It's just throwing away the past. No, I think it's absolutely crucial. The question is whether there's a way to deal with it in a more heuristic and still sufficiently well way. So I have to come up with an example and fly, but you have some key event in your life, long time ago in some city or something, you realized that's a really dangerous street or whatever. And you want to remember that forever, in case you come back there. Kind of a selective kind of memory. So you remember all the important events in the past, but somehow selecting the important is. That's very hard. And I'm not concerned about just storing the whole history. Just, you can calculate, human life says 30 or 100 years, doesn't matter, right? How much data comes in through the vision system and the auditory system, you compress it a little bit, in this case, lossily and store it. We are soon in the means of just storing it. But you still nee
 do crave power. For sure. What words is that deeply in the psychology of people? Is it something you're born with? Is it something you develop? Some people crave a position of leadership or of standing out, of being recognized, and that could be starting out in the school years on the schoolyard. It could be within their own family, not just in their peer group. Those kind of people we often see craving leadership positions from a young age often end up in positions of power. But they can be varied positions of power. You can have power in an institution where your power is purposefully limited. For example, there's a board or a consultative body or a separation of powers. Not everyone craves power whereby they're the sole power or they're their unconstrained power. That's a little bit less usual. We may think that everybody does, but not everybody does. Those people who do crave that kind of power, unconstrained, the ability to decide as much as life or death of other people, those people are not everyday people. They're not the people
theless, it's a real sentiment in the population. Sometimes because they feel frustrated because things are not getting done. Sometimes because they're against something that's happening in the political realm and they feel it has to be corrected and corrected quickly. It's a kind of impulse. People can regret the impulse later on, that the impulse is motivated by reaction to their environment. In the Russian case, we have also people who crave, sometimes known as a strong hand, an iron hand, an authoritarian leader, because they want things to be done and be done more quickly that align with their desires. But I'm not sure it's a majority in the country today. Certainly in Stalin's time, this was a widespread sentiment and people had few alternatives that they understood or could appeal to. Nowadays in the globalized world, the citizens of Russia can see how other systems have constraints on executive power and the life isn't so bad there. In fact, the life might even be better. So the impatience, the impulsive quality, the frustration d
 a way that is pretty gripping to watch. So you worked on this kind of stuff, we can go back 10 years ago. You wrote an essay called Innovation Starvation. You worked on this kind of idea since then, kind of looking at maybe a little bit cynically about our age today and our unwillingness to take on big risky projects. So in the face of that, what do you think of people like Elon Musk? Because to me, people like that are inspiring and gives you hope in the face of a more kind of pessimistic perspective of our age. Yeah, well he's clearly willing to tackle big ambitious projects without a lot of kind of soul searching or trying to make up his mind, right? It's just like, let's dig tunnels under cities. Go. Step one, make a joke about it on Twitter. Step two, actually do it. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, things have slowed down quite a bit. Our ability to build things at pace is a lot less than it was, and there's reasons for that. We're more concerned with safety and environmental impacts than people were when they were building some of the great P
d to the selection for the planning part and the compression for the understanding part. The raw storage I'm really not concerned about. And I think we should just store, if you develop an agent, preferably just store all the interaction history. And then you build of course models on top of it and you compress it and you are selective, but occasionally you go back to the old data and reanalyze it based on your new experience you have. Sometimes you are in school, you learn all these things you think is totally useless and much later you realize, oh, they were not so useless as you thought. I'm looking at you, linear algebra. Right. So maybe let me ask about objective functions because that rewards, it seems to be an important part. The rewards are kind of given to the system. For a lot of people, the specification of the objective function is a key part of intelligence. The agent itself figuring out what is important. What do you think about that? Is it possible within the IXE framework to yourself discover the reward based on whi
ut also physics, you know, it often feels like, man, we don't really understand most of what's going on here. And certainly that's true with the human mind. Yeah. Well, to me, that's the proper epistemological stance. I don't know anything. Well, it's the Socratic I know that I don't know, which is the first step on the path to wisdom. pandemic that's happening now. And Lex, you make a, I think a really profoundly important point, you know, back to our work for a bit or Ernest Becker rather, you know, his point is, is that the way that we manage existential terror is to embrace culturally constructed belief systems that give us a sense that life has meaning and we have value. And in the form of self esteem, which we get from perceiving that we meet or exceed the expectations associated with the role that we play in society. Well, here we are right now in a world where first of all, if you have nothing, you are nothing. And secondly, as you were saying before we got started today, a lot of jobs are gone and they're not coming back. And that's the, wher
cs for me, it's for a lot of people is if you just give it a chance to struggle, if you give yourself time to struggle, you'll find a way, you'll find the thing within that thing that you can lose track of time with. Yeah. That's a key detail that, um, that's an important thing to add to, to what I said, which is that, uh, this might not happen the first time you do a thing. Maybe it will, but, um, uh, you might have to climb that learning curve and, um, if there's pressures in your life that are making you feel bad about that, then, um, it might prevent you from, from getting where you need to be. Um, so there's some complexity there, uh, that make, can make this kind of non obvious. Um, but, uh, that's what, that's why we need, you know, good teachers. Um, you know, another beneficial thing, uh, of the internet is YouTube and being able to learn things, how to do things on YouTube, the, the, the dude who made the YouTube video doesn't care how many times you hit pause and rewind, um, they're never going to like roll their eyes and, and be impatient with you. Um, and
cal part, it doesn't matter. In fact, you don't wanna know if it does good or not because most of the time it won't. So like in a certain sense, it's understandable why altruism without the effective part is so appealing to a certain population. By the way, let's zoom off for a second. Do you think most people, two questions. Do you think most people are good? And question number two is, do you think most people wanna do good? So are most people good? I think it's just super dependent on the circumstances that someone is in. I think that the actions people take and their moral worth is just much more dependent on circumstance than it is on someone's intrinsic character. So is there evil within all of us? It seems like with the better angels of our nature, there's a tendency of us as a society to tend towards good, less war. I mean, with all these metrics. Is that us becoming who we want to be our nature how the technologies improve fundamentally improving most of the world's lives. Yeah, and actually there's some psychological research on the
 my finger around an object. And if I touch enough spaces, I go, okay, now I know what it is. But often we don't do that. Often I can just reach and grab something with my hand all at once and I get it. Or if I had to look through the world through a straw, so I'm only invoking one little column, I can only see part of something because I have to move the straw around. But if I open my eyes, I see the whole thing at once. So what we think is going on is all these little pieces of spaghetti, if you will, all these little columns in the cortex, are all trying to guess what it is that they're sensing. They'll do a better guess if they have time and can move over time. So if I move my eyes, I move my fingers. But if they don't, they have a poor guess. It's a probabilistic guess of what they might be touching. Now, imagine they can post their probability at the top of a little piece of spaghetti. Each one of them says, I think, and it's not really a probability distribution. It's more like a set of possibilities. In the brain, it doesn't work as a pro
. For context, I'm a black belt in Jiu Jitsu and have competed in wrestling, submission grappling, Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and even catch wrestling, which is a variant of submission grappling that Josh is one of the great practitioners, scholars and teachers of. I could probably talk for hours about what I've learned from my time on the mat, but if I were to say one thing, it is that the mat is honest. You can't run away from yourself when you step on the mat. It reveals your fears, the lies you might tell yourself, all the delusions you might have, or at least I had, that there's anything in this world that can be achieved except through blood, sweat, and tears. That honesty, taken to the highest levels, as is the case with Josh, creates the most special of human beings and definitely someone who is fascinating to talk to. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Josh Barnett. Who were the phil
tually sense. We're the only people who know about the far side of the moon, and the other universes, and I mean, other galaxies, and other stars, and about what happens in the atom. There's no, that knowledge doesn't exist anywhere else. It's only in our heads. Cats don't do it, dogs don't do it, monkeys don't do it, it's just on. And that is what we've created that's unique. Not our genes, it's knowledge. And if I asked me, what is the legacy of humanity? What should our legacy be? It should be knowledge. We should preserve our knowledge in a way that it can exist beyond us. And I think the best way of doing that, in fact you have to do it, is it has to go along with intelligent machines that understand that knowledge. It's a very broad idea, but we should be thinking, I call it a state planning for humanity. We should be thinking about what we wanna leave behind when as a species we're no longer here. And that'll happen sometime. Sooner or later it's gonna happen. And understanding intelligence and creating intelligence gives us a better chance to pro
ich of these principles that the brain works on are necessary and which ones are not? Clearly, we don't have to build this in, and intelligent machines aren't gonna be built out of organic living cells. But there's a lot of stuff that goes on the brain that's gonna be necessary. So let me ask maybe, before we get into the fun details, let me ask maybe a depressing or a difficult question. Do you think it's possible that we will never be able to understand how our brain works, that maybe there's aspects to the human mind, like we ourselves cannot introspectively get to the core, that there's a wall you eventually hit? Yeah, I don't believe that's the case. I have never believed that's the case. There's not been a single thing humans have ever put their minds to that we've said, oh, we reached the wall, we can't go any further. It's just, people keep saying that. People used to believe that about life. Alain Vital, right, there's like, what's the difference between living matter and nonliving matter, something special that we never understand. We no lon
gineer of consciousness, that should just be engineerable. And that's just triggering certain chemical reactions. And so it doesn't mean they have to be mutually exclusive. You can have that and experience that and also not sacrifice longterm health. And I think that's the potential of where we're going is we don't have to assume they are trade offs that must be had. Absolutely. And so I guess for my particular brain, it's useful to have the outlier experiences that also come along with the illusion of free will where I chose those experiences that make me feel like it's freedom. Listen, going to Texas made me realize I spent, so I still am, but I lived at Cambridge at MIT and I never felt like home there. I felt like home in the space of ideas with the colleagues, like when I was actually discussing ideas, but there is something about the constraints, how cautious people are, how much they valued also kind of a material success, career success. When I showed up to Texas, it felt like I belong. That was very interesting, but that's my neu
. Sign them in to the journal. There's a journal of daily events. Everything that takes place in the firehouse 24 seven has to be logged. And I logged myself as coming in, reporting for duty. And as the guys came in, I logged them in. And then one of our lieutenants took command. We grabbed up a bunch of gear, and they basically told us, get 12 guys, get a city bus, and get down to the battery tunnel they said would probably be closed. There was threats it was going to be blown up to get to the Brooklyn Bridge. And so we did. We got a city bus. We flagged it down, and the bus driver said, I'm sorry. I can't give you the bus. I will drive you. And he took us, and we stopped at Engine 201, which is just about a quarter mile down the road from us. That's our affiliated engine company, and my childhood best friend here, Johnny Schardt, he was assigned there, and he was on shift. And then they went through the tunnel. And we picked up those guys, the off duty guys from 201, and then we kept going down Fourth Avenue, and we picked up 239's crew. And then we hightaile
tellites separated by hundreds of thousands of kilometers and they send a laser beam from one to the other. And if the triangle changes shape a little bit, they detect that from a graph. Did you say hundreds of thousands of kilometers? Yeah. Sending lasers to each other. Okay. It's just engineering. Is it possible though? Is it doable? Yes. Okay. That's just incredible because they have to maintain, I mean, the precision here is probably, there might be some more, what is it? Maybe noise is a smaller problem. I guess there's no vibration to worry about like seismic stuff. So getting away from earth, maybe you get away from seismic stuff. Yeah. Those parts are easier. They don't have to measure it as accurately at low frequencies. But they have a lot of tough engineering problems. In order to detect that the gravitational waves affect things, the sensors have to be what we call free masses, just like ours, are isolated from the earth. They have to isolate it from the satellite. And that's a hard problem. They have to do that pretty, not as well a
engineer. And with his crew who subsequently passed away, the crew did, he was effectively rescuing dozens of people on the upper floors, and his boss ordered him to assist an elderly gentleman who was 89 down 78 flights of stairs to get him out. And in stopping on the 21st floor, he figured they would just wait there for medics. He came across Captain Patty Brown of Ladder Company 3, who told him, no, sir, you need to evacuate. And Captain Brown picked his brain a little bit about the structure because he figured, found out he was an engineer. And Captain Patty Brown continued on to effect rescues, and he and his crew were killed. But father, he's now, Mark was able to effectively evacuate this gentleman. They were the two known last survivors to come out of the tower. He now has dedicated his life to becoming a Coptic priest in St. Mary's Church in East Brunswick, New Jersey. He did this for a total stranger. And he said he was inspired by his bosses who died and his friends. One of his best friends was an Italian man. The other man was a re
s have a low time preference where they think about things for many generations. Whereas in a democratic system, your president is likely only going to be there for four years or eight years or 10 years or five years or whatever it is. So the only way that, you know, all humans are self interested. So the only way that your president in a democracy can provide for themselves is to maximize the amount of exploitation that they can do of the population during their brief stint. And then when he's out, you get a new one, and then that one wants to start all over again. So every four years, you get a new robber. With monarchy, you sign up for a multi generation subscription to the same family. And when they have the security of knowing that, you know, his great grandson is going to be taking money from your great grandson, suddenly his interest in yours align because they both want your great grandson to be prosperous and have enough money for his great grandson to take. It's a monarchy with a tiny government. So anything required to r
 to have a currency that was redeemable in gold so that you could trade with the rest of the world so that people could in your country use that currency. So it's not that governments were choosing gold. It's more like they were having to adapt their own currencies to gold in order to give their currencies credibility. So there's a dance there though, because if they had to, then why did they switch away from it after? So there is a dance where the governments, the people pressure. So first of all, the basic characteristics of the hard money pressures the governments and the people in terms of what should be used. Then the people, based on their community, the network effects, the narratives they tell each other, all that kind of stuff, they pressure the governments to take on a particular money. Then the governments, they like power, they like control, all those kinds of things. They pressure the people and tell different kinds of narratives. So there's a dance going on in this evolution of what technology to use for a monetary syst
st and so on. And so I can say to you, okay, Lex, were you conscious this morning when you had your bagel? And you'd say, yes, I was conscious. Now what if I could take your brain and revert all the synapses back to the state they were this morning? And then I said to you, Lex, were you conscious when you ate the bagel? And you said, no, I wasn't conscious. I said, here's a video of eating the bagel. And you said, I wasn't there. That's not possible because I must've been unconscious at that time. So we can just make this one to one correlation between memory of your body's trajectory through the world over some period of time, a memory and the ability to recall that memory is what you would call conscious. I was conscious of that, it's a self awareness. And any system that can recall, memorize what it's done recently and bring that back and invoke it again would say, yeah, I'm aware. I remember what I did. All right, I got it. That's an easy one. Although some people think that's a hard one. The more challenging part of consciousness is this one that's 
 hexagons in it, they'll like send me a link to make fun of me. So as some. One of those people, Roger Penrose or. I think Roger's a little above my level. He's into hexagons as well and tiling. Yeah. Yeah. So I did a lot of that and I thought, you know, it was pretty cool, but there's some like surprisingly intractable problems that keep coming up. Like you've always got to have some pentagons. Like if you start with the icosahedron, which is equilateral triangles, which is a logical place to start, you can cover those with hexagons, but every vertex where the triangles come together is a pentagon. Has to be a pentagon. Oh, interesting. So it's all hexagons and then there's a pentagon at the intersections. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. How'd you figure that out? Is that a known fact? Well, it's just, if you look at a. Yeah. Like just by inspection. It's an obvious thing. Got it. Yeah. So any system that you come up with to do this has got to have this exceptions built into it for those 12. You could have quintillions of hexagons, but you've still got to have 12 pentagons 
 as chess is still something that human beings can't comprehend completely. Even the best players lose, still sometimes lose and they consistently lose to computers these days. And in computer science, there's a concept of NP complete. So large classes of problems when you scale them up beyond a few individuals become intractable. And so that in that sense, the world is inexhaustible. And that makes it beautiful that we can make any laws that generalize efficiently and well can compress all of that combinatorial complexity just like a simple rule. That in itself is beautiful. It's a happy situation. And I think that we can find general principles of sort of of the operating system that are comprehensible, simple, extremely powerful and let us control things very well and ask profound questions. And on the other hand, that the world is going to be inexhaustible. That once we start asking about relationships and how they evolve and social interactions and we'll never have a theory of everything in any meaningful sense because that
ked up these books that you read and you read the books and you made pencil marks in them, is it because you absorbed the lesson there? Or did it really not become a permanent lesson and it was just something that you checked and it was like a reflex? So I have many specific questions about many specific events and people and circumstances that I have tried to figure out with the surviving source materials that we have in abundance. But I would still like to delve into his mindset and reconstruct his mind. The closer you get to Stalin, in some ways, the more elusive he can become. And especially around World War II, you've already illuminated a lot of interesting aspects about Stalin's role in the war, but it would be interesting to ask even more questions about how seat of the pants or deliberate some of the decisions have been. If I could ask just one quick question, one last quick question, and you're constrained in time and answering it, do you think there will always be evil in the world? Do you think there will always be
are churning out goods, and those goods have a certain quantity and value, market value, and it's completely nonsensical of course, because how can the value of the goods produced be different from the value of the spending? But let's put that aside for a second. So the amount of spending that happens in the economy determines the state of the economy. If the value of the production, which they call Y is higher than the aggregate expenditures, so this is the production and then the aggregate expenditure is lower, then we don't have enough spending to buy all the goods. And then that causes a recession. The factories start laying off workers and then the laid off workers start spending less. And then that leads to aggregate expenditure dropping even further. And so it's a vicious cycle where the economy gets into recession. And the only way out is for Keynes's bankster buddies and government buddies to print a lot of money to give to themselves. And then that will... That's one interpretation. But to print more money to increase the ex
the biological process and the genes that mediate that biological process. So knowing all of this can now allow you to find the target genes. How? By basically doing perturbation experiments or by looking at the folding of the epigenome or by looking at the genetic impact of that genetic variant on the expression of genes. And we use all three. So let me go through them. Basically one of them is physical links. This is the folding of the genome onto itself. How do you even figure out the folding? It's a little bit of a tangent, but it's a super awesome technology. Think of the genome as again, this massive packaging that we talked about of taking two meters worth of DNA and putting it in something that's a million times smaller than two meters worth of DNA. That's a single cell. You basically have this massive packaging and this packaging basically leads to the chromosome being wrapped around in sort of tight, tight ways in ways, however, that are functionally capable of being reopened and reclosed. So I can then go in and figure 
o realize that we've been living a lie of sorts. Becker calls it a necessary lie. And we have to momentarily dispose of that. And so now Kierkegaard says, well, here I am. I have shrugged off all of the all of the cultural accoutrements that I have used to define myself. And now what am I or who am I? This is like the ancient Greek tragedy where the worst thing was to be no one or no thing. At this point, Kierkegaard said, you're really dangling on the precipice of oblivion. And some people tumble into that abyss and never come out. On the other hand, Kierkegaard said that what you can now do metaphorically and literally is to rebuild yourself from the ground up. And there's a, in the new Testament, there's something you have to die in order to be reborn. And Kierkegaard's view though, is that there's only one way to do that. This is his proverbial leap into faith. And in Kierkegaard's case, it was faith in Christianity, that you can't have unbridled faith in cultural constructions. The only thing that you can have unequivocal faith in is s
could be wrong, but you know, you ask me for my opinion. Yes, yes. Sorry, so it's that little bit of a caveat. So to go back to the idea, then on the other hand, you have the level of, if the other situation is when the level of spending is higher than the amount of aggregate output. In that situation, you have too much spending. So therefore what ends up happening is inflation. So according to the Keynesian worldview, this is really important because this is a way that I'm gonna get to your point about empirical data and to show you why they're not correct. Yeah, they're not correct about what they say about empirical data. So then what this means is that there's a level of output and there's a level of aggregate expenditure. The aggregate expenditure can either be higher or lower than the output or equal to it. If it's higher, we get inflation. If it's lower, we get recessions, okay? So is there any universe in this model? Is there any potential universe in which you can have both inflation and a recession? According to the Keynesian model, y
o themselves. And we have a lot of that kind of thing. And I think, I mean, build into the some of the examples that I gave you. And so, how do you then, so, so the key almost in anything you do is the people themselves, right? So in our case, the first and most important was to attract to spend years of their life on this. And the best possible people in the world to do it. So the only way to convince them is that somehow it's better and more interesting for them than what they could do themselves. And so that's part of this idea. Yeah, that's powerful. But nevertheless, there's best people in the world, there's egos. Is there something to be said about managing egos? Oh, that's the human problem is always the hardest. And so there's, that's an art, not a science, I think. I think the fact here that combined, there's a was a romantic goal that we had to, you know, do something that people hadn't done before, which was important scientifically and, and a huge challenge, enabled us to say, take and get, I mean, what we did just to take an example, we use t
, bump. But, and I don't think that's really ego. I think that's part of the process in a good way, like an athlete does that. So extreme confidence is what some of the best athletes come with, and you think it's possible to, as a writer, to have extreme confidence in yourself? I do think so, you know, that I'm sure when John Lennon sat down to write a song, he felt like, shit, I can do this, you know? I'm not so sure. I think, because the great artists I've seen, and you're haunted by self doubt. It's that resist, I mean, the confidence. Yes, but I mean, I guess, but even beyond the self, within the self, above the self doubt. Oh, it's the bigger picture of the self belief, you know? Yeah, I'm freaking out. Yeah, I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able to do it. But, you know, I know I can do this. Yeah, and when you look at, when you take a bigger picture of it. So the writing process, is it fundamentally lonely? No, because you're with your characters. You are. So you really put yourself in the world. Absolutely, you know, I've written about this before that I used to, my 
ing at around, the average electricity price in the world is around 14 cents. If you're mining at 14 cents in Bitcoin, you're most likely not gonna make it. If you're running your miners at 14 cents, because everybody could mine at 14 cents, and so what happens is if everybody's mining at 14 cents, 14 cents stops being profitable, and then only the people mining at a lower price are profitable. So that's why Bitcoin mining is not competing with your washing machine. This is the absurd thing about this kind of energy scarcity viewpoint where, oh no, it's a catastrophe, Bitcoin is taking all the electricity, as if the electricity is just one fixed pie that we all have to share and fight over. And this is how I keep making fun of these stupid headlines they put out where Bitcoin's consuming more electricity than Portugal. All right, well, maybe we should shut down Portugal then. What the hell is Portugal giving us? Like, obviously it's not, it's not competing. He doesn't mean that, I've gotten so much criticism for saying Cristiano Ronaldo's not in the top fi
require very little amount of information. So when you look at all of the buzzwords that the Ethereum and other altcoin marketing people like to use, and you know, if you want to wonder really why we come to this kind of aggression is because we've heard all of this, you know, I've had all of these hucksters come to me for years, you know, it's been, I've had, you know, people in 2016 talk to me about how Ethereum blockchain technology is going to revolutionize real estate deeds in India. I remember this guy, I'm not going to mention his name, but this guy was, you know, 2016, and he sold a lot of shitcoins and he made a lot of money off of shitcoins based on all these silly ideas. We're going to have Blackjack on a distributed ledger. We're going to have Indian real estate on a distributed ledger. And it's just, it's concerned trolling marketing. You know, oh, there's a problem with real estate in India, real estate deeds, blockchain fixes this, buy my shitcoin. And then people buy the shitcoin, Indian real estate isn't fixed, and the guy gets rich and th
w that there's a leak and it will be affecting it. Well, we can measure how good the vacuum is so we can know that, but a leak can develop and then we don't, how do we fix it or how do we find it? And so that was, you asked about a worry. That was always a really big worry. What's the difference, you know, high vacuum and a vacuum? What is high vacuum? That's like some delta close to vacuum? Is it some threshold? Well, there's a unit. High vacuum is when the vacuum and the units that are used, which are tors, there's 10 to the minus nine. And there's high vacuum is usually used in small places. The biggest vacuum system period is at CERN in this big particle accelerator, but the high vacuum where they need really good vacuum so particles don't scatter in it is smaller than ours. So ours is a really large high vacuum system. I don't know. This is so cool. I mean, this is basically by far the greatest listening device ever built by human. The fact that like descendants of apes could do this, that evolution started with single cell organisms. I mean, i
f play. And so either we need to provide detailed reward. That doesn't just reward for achieving a goal, but rewards for making progress, and that becomes time consuming. And once you're starting to do that, let's say you want a robot to do something, you need to give all this detailed reward. Well, why not just give a demonstration? Because why not just show the robot? And now the question is, how do you show the robot? One way to show is to tally operate the robot, and then the robot really experiences things. And that's nice, because that's really high signal to noise ratio data, and we've done a lot of that. And you teach your robot skills in just 10 minutes, you can teach your robot a new basic skill, like okay, pick up the bottle, place it somewhere else. That's a skill, no matter where the bottle starts, maybe it always goes onto a target or something. That's fairly easy to teach your robot with tally up. Now, what's even more interesting if you can now teach your robot through third person learning, where the robot watches you do something 
st have a bunch of axons that are firing at different rates. And from that, we perceive color. But there is no color in the brain. I mean, there's no color coming in on those synapses. It's just a correlation between some axons and some property of frequency. And that isn't even color itself. Frequency doesn't have a color. It's just what it is. So then the question is, well, why does it even appear to have a color at all? Just as you're describing it, there seems to be a connection to those ideas of reference frames. I mean, it just feels like consciousness having the subject, assigning the feeling of red to the actual color or to the wavelength is useful for intelligence. Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it. It's useful as a predictive mechanism or useful as a generalization idea. It's a way of grouping things together to say, it's useful to have a model like this. So think about the well known syndrome that people who've lost a limb experience called phantom limbs. And what they claim is they can have their arm is removed, but they
